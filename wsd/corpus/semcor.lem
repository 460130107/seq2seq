he 'll even bull head-on into the rule when he is sure he 's right . 
that 's how he first win the masters in 1958 . 
it happen on the twelfth hole , a 155 - yarder . 
person 's iron shot from the tee burrow into the bunker guard the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rain , thereby bring local rule into force . 
`` i can remove the ball , can't i '' ? ask person of an official . 
`` no '' , say the official . 
`` you must play it where it lie '' . 
`` you 're wrong '' , say person , a man who know the rule . 
`` i 'll do as you say , but i 'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling '' . 
he score a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one . 
the golfing father rule_in his favor . 
so he pick_up a stroke with the provisional ball and win the tournament by the margin of that stroke . 
until a_few week ago , however , person be some godlike creature who have nothing in_common with the duffer . 
but after that 12 at los_angeles he become one_of_the_boys , a bigger hero than he ever had be before . 
a formula to supply player for the new group and the problem of increase the 1961 schedule to fourteen game will be discuss by group owner at a meeting at the group today .

the owner would_like each club in the fourteen team league to play a home and home series with team in its division , plus two game against team in the other division . 
however , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen week . 
person , the league commissioner , point_out : 
`` we 'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other '' . 
nine of the league 's team play in baseball park and therefore face an early season conflict in date . 
if the cardinals heed person of the group , they won't be mislead by the group ' slow start this season .

tonight at 8 o'clock the group , who give the group as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 , break_even with them , will get their first 1961 shot at baseball 's world champion . 
the group have a 9 - 6 record this year and the group be 7 - 9 . 
person announce a switch in his starting_pitcher , from person to person , for several reason : 
1 . 
person 's 4 - 0 won-lost_record and 1.24 earned_run mark against group a year ago ; 2 . 
the desire to give person as many start as possible ; 3 . 
the group ' disheartening 11 - 7 collapse against the group sunday . 
person , eager to end a pitching slump that has bring four loss in the five game on the current home stand , move person to the wednesday night starting assignment .

`` i have to stay with person for_a_while '' , person say . 
`` person ( sore ankle ) should be ready . 
with a left-hander go for group , i may use person in center '' . 
`` person throw bat practice about 25 minute , and he look good '' , person say . 
`` he should be get_back in_the_groove before_long . 
our pitching be much better than it has show '' .

person with .179 and person with .143 be the only group drag_one's_feet . 
perhaps the group who will be the unhappy over the news that person probably will sit_out most of the series be person , who was beat by person twice last season on dramatic home_run . 
person be off to a great start with a 4 - 0 record but be n't likely to see action here this week . 
`` we 're get person some run for a change , and he has been pitch good '' , person say . 
`` person has been blast the ball . 
no plunker for him '' . 
the group jump_off to an 11 - 3 start by may 1 last year , when the group as_well_as the group hold them even over the season . 
on last may 1 , the group stand at 7 - 6 , end a two season falloff on that milestone . 
in 1958 , group be 3 - 10 on may 1 . 
a year later they be 4 - 13 . 
since 1949 , the st._louis club has be below .500 on may 1 just four time .

`` by win against group , group and group on those team ' home court , they show that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn 's take a super team to do_it '' . 
group find a way to win a baseball_game . 
person last night pitch a no-hit_game , say to be the first in group baseball history , as the group beat group , 5 - 1 , at location . 
the victory be the first of the season for the group after nine defeat and a tie . 
the tie was against group last friday .

the group be set to play at group at 3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at location , location , saturday . 
if it 's true that contented cow give more milk , why should n't happy ball player produce more base_hit ? 
the two top talent of the time , person and person , have hit the ball hard and more successfully so_far this early season than at any period in career which , to be frank about it , never have quite reach expectation . 
and that 's mean as a boost , not a knock . 
person and person , both 10 - year man at 30 , have so much ability that , baseball man agree , they 've never hit the height . 
their height , that_is . 
person , the bullnecked blond switch-hitter , have one sensational triple-crown_season , 1959 , when he bat .365 and also lead the group in home_run , 52 , and rbi , 130 . 
like the group ' slugger , person , the terror of the group , has have season that would be consider the ultimate by most player , but not by - or for - person . 
his best year be 1954 when he hit .345 with 41 homer and '55 when he belt 51 home_run , drive_in 127 and steal 24 base . 
now , apparently happy under new manager , person and person , the perfect player , are behave as though they 're going_to pass those previous peak . 
yes , we know , they 're professional , man paid to play , and they should n't care how they 're handle , just as_long_as their name are spell correctly on the first and fifteenth of each_month . 
the truth be , though , that man react differently to different treatment . 
for_that_matter , person be rare , possess the disposition that enable him to put_out the same for seven manager , reserve his opinion , but not his effort . 
person , it 's apparent , resent person 's attempt to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager see as a thrilling possibility . 
the old_man be almost too possessive . 
person inherit person , person , but he bring_up person from class c to the majors , from location to location . 
with the speed and power of the body beautiful he see before him , person want no. 7 to be not_only the best home_run hitter , but also the best bunter , base_runner and outfielder . 
person probably preach too_much in the early day when the kid want to pop his bubble_gum and sow_one's_oats . 
inherit a more mature person , who now has see the sight on and off location , person quietly bestow , no pun intend , the mantle of authority on person . 
the person decide that , rather_than be lead , the slugger could lead . 
and what leadership a proud person has give so_far . 
the opinion continue here that with a 162 - game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10 - team league and a most inviting target in los_angeles ' location , person just might break the most glamorous record on the book , person 's 60 homer of 1927 . 
person ' day come a day early for person than for the kid and commie this year . 
person 's wonderful walloping sunday - four home_run - serve merely to emphasize how happy he be to be play for person . 
next to person , person teach person the most when he be a grass green rookie rush up_to the location 10 year ago this month , to help the group win a dramatic pennant .

an electric_toothbrush ( broxodent ) may soon take its place next to the electric_razor in the american bathroom . 
the brush move up_and_down and be small enough to clean every dental surface , include the back of the tooth . 
in_addition , the motor have the seal_of_approval of the group , which mean it be safe .

several dentist and patient with special dental problem have experiment with the device . 
the result be good although they be difficult to compare with hand brushing , particularly when the individual know how to brush his tooth properly . 
the electric gadget be most helpful when there be many crowned tooth and in individual who be elderly , bedfast with a chronic disease , or are handicap by disorder such_as cerebral_palsy or muscular_dystrophy . 
but for many_of us , it will prove an enjoyable luxury . 
it be not as convenient as the old type toothbrush and the paste tend to shimmy of the bristle .

an ordinary hot bath or shower will do the same . 
write : what make my hand numb when sewing ?

write : does the cholesterol go_down when most of the thyroid_gland is remove ? 
no . 
it usually go_up . 
the cholesterol level in the blood is influence by the gland of the body . 
it be low when the thyroid be overactive and high when the gland be sluggish . 
the latter be likely to occur when the thyroid is remove . 
the gap between the bookshelf and the record cabinet grow small with each new recording catalogue . 
there 's more reading and instruction to be hear on disc than ever before , although the spoken rather_than the sung word be as old as person 's first experiment in recorded sound . 
person could hardly have guess , however , that person would one day appear in stereo . 
if the record buyer 's taste be somewhat eclectic or even the slight bit esoteric , he will find them satisfy on educational record . 
and he will avoid eyestrain in the process . 
everything from poetry to phonetics , history to histrionics , philosophy to party_game has been adapt to the turntable . 
for sheer ambition , take the group series title modestly `` wisdom '' . 
volume one and two , select from the soundtrack of a television series , contain `` conversation with the elder wise_man of our day '' . 
these sage include poet person , statesman person and sculptor person , in volume one , and playwright person , person , philosopher person and the late person in the second set . 
person is hear interview person , for an added prestige fillip . 
there 's more specialization and a narrow purpose in two album recently issue by group . 
group `` publish '' what the company call `` listen_and_learn '' production design to teach foreign language . 
previous presentation have be on french , spanish , russian , italian , german and japanese . 
but the firm has recognize the tight dollar and the tourist 's desire to visit the `` smaller , less traveled and relatively inexpensive country '' , and be now prepared to teach modern_greek and portuguese through recording .

thanks to spoken_arts_records , history buff may hear person 's `` most memorable speech and letter '' in a two disc set , interpret by person authority and lecturer person .

for those who `` like poetry but never get_around_to read it '' , the group make it possible for poet to be hear read their own work . 
the program was institute in 1940 , and release be available only from the group of the group , washington 25 , location a catalogue be available on_request . 
new on the list be person , person , person , person , person , person , person , person , person and person . 
two poet are pair on each record , in the order give above . 
group be not the only large commercial company to impart instruction . 
group have an ambitious and useful project in a stereo series called `` adventure in music '' , which be an instructional record library for elementary_school . 
person and the group perform in the first two release , design for grade one and two . 
teaching guide are include with each record . 
in an effort to fortify himself against the unforeseen upset sure to arise in the future , person , banker editor of the phoenix `` group '' , reflect upon a_few of the depressing experience of the feverish fifties . 
one of the rough be the tv quiz show , which give him inferiority_complex . 
though it be a great relief when the big brain on these show turn_out to be fraud and phony , it do irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many_another intelligent , well-informed american . 
but the one that upset the financially wise be the professional dancer who relate in a book how he parlay his earnings into a $ 2000000 profit on the stock_market . 
every man who dabble_in the market to make a_little easy_money on_the_side and suffer losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wonder how her husband could be so dumb . 
investor breathe more freely when it was learn that this acrobatic dancer had turn magician and was only do a best_seller book to make some dough . 
people who take_for us for sucker be like the westerner who have on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form of a number of bull's_eye achievement . 
the promoter who want to sign_up him up for the circus ask him how he be able to do it . 
his answer be simple but honest . 
he just shoot at the board and_then draw circle around the hole to form a bull's_eye . 
one of the obstacle to the easy control of a 2 - year old child be a lack of verbal communication . 
the child understand no . 
he sense his mother 's disapproval . 
but explanation leave him confused and unmoved . 
if his mother love him , he cling_to that love as a ballast . 
it motivate his behavior . 
he want mommy to think him a good boy . 
he does n't want her to look frowningly at him , or speak_to him angrily . 
this breaks_his_heart . 
he want to be call sweet , good , considerate and mother 's little helper . 
but even mother 's loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior . 
his desire be so strong that he need constant reassurance of his mother 's love for him and what she expect of him , in_order to overcome them . 
his own inner voice , which should tell him what not to do , has not develop . 
it won't develop until he have words with which to clothe it . 
the conscience be nonexistent in the 2 - year old . 
what can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior ? 
she can decrease the number of temptation . 
she can remove all knickknacks within reach . 
the fewer no she has_to utter the more effective they will be . 
she should offer substitute for the temptation which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child . 
if he can't play with mommy 's magazine , he should have some old number of his own . 
if daddy 's book be out-of-bounds his own picture_book be not . 
toy he have can be make to act_as substitute for family temptation such_as refrigerator and gas_stove . 
during this precarious period of development the mother should continue to influence the growth of the child 's conscience . 
she tell him of the consequence of his behavior . 
if he bite a playmate she say , `` person won't like you '' . 
if he snatch a toy , she say , `` person want her own truck just as you do '' . 
there be no use try to `` explain '' to a 2 - year old . 
action speak loud . 
remove temptation . 
remove the child from the scene of his misbehavior . 
substitute approved object for forbidden ones and keep tell him how he is to act . 
he won't submit to his natural desire all_the_time , and it be mother 's love that is responsible_for his good behavior . 
the nuclear war is already being fight , except that the bomb are not being drop on enemy target - not_yet . 
it is being fight , moreover , in fairly close correspondence with the prediction of the soothsayer of the think_factory . 
they predict escalation , and escalation be what we are get . 
the biggest nuclear device the united_states has explode measure some 15 megaton , although our b-52 are say to be carry two 20 - megaton_bomb apiece . 
some time ago , however , person decide that when bigger bomb were make , the soviet_union would make them . 
he seem to have at_least a_few 30 - and 50 - megaton_bomb on_hand , since we cannot assume that he has explode his entire stock . 
and now , of_course , the hue_and_cry for counter escalation is being raise on our side . 
person threaten us with a 100 - megaton_bomb ? 
so_be_it - then we must embark_on a crash program for 200 - megaton_bomb of the common or hydrogen variety , and neutron_bomb , which do not exist but are say to be the coming thing . 
so escalation proceed , ad_infinitum or , more accurately , until the contestant begin drop them on each other instead_of on their respective proving_ground . 
what is needed , person write in the_cornell_daily_sun ( october 26 ) be a discontinuity . 
the escalation must end sometime , and probably quite soon . 
`` only a discontinuity can end it '' , person write . 
`` the discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy '' . 
person point_out that since our country is more urbanized than the soviet_union or red_china , it be the most vulnerable of the great_power - europe of_course must be write_off out_of_hand . 
he feel , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the united_states be the least risky path our government can take . 
his proposal be opposed to that of person , person , past chairman person and person of the group , person and those others now enjoy their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold_war . 
these gentleman are call_for a resumption of testing - in the atmosphere - on the greatest possible scale , all in_the_name_of national security . 
escalation be their first love and their last ; they will be faithful unto death . 
capable as their mind may be in some direction , these guardian of the nation 's security be incapable of learn , or even of observe . 
if this capacity had not fail them , they would see that their enemy has make a disastrous miscalculation . 
he has gain only one thing - he has explode a 50 - megaton_bomb and he probably have rocket with sufficient thrust to lob it over the short intercontinental range . 
but if his purpose be to inspire terror , his action could hardly have miscarry more obviously . 
not terror , but anger and resentment have be the general reaction outside the soviet sphere . 
person himself is report to be concern by the surge of animosity he has arouse , yet our own nuclear statesman seem intent_on follow compulsively in his footstep . 
when one powerful nation strive to emulate the success of another , it be only natural . 
thus , when the russian send up their first sputnik , american chagrin be human enough , and american determination to put american satellite into orbit be perfectly understandable . 
but to imitate an opponent when he has make the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly . 
when east_german flee to the west by the thousand , paean of joy rise from the throat of western publicist . 
they be less vocal now , when it be the west_berliner who are migrate . 
the flood be not as great - only 700 a week according_to one apparently conservative account - but it be symptomatic . 
location morale be low and , in age distribution , the situation be unfavorable . 
nearly 18 percent of location 's 2200000 resident be sixty-five or older , only 12.8 percent be under fifteen . 
person , m.p. , write in the_manchester_guardian , state that departure from location are now run at the rate not of 700 , but of 1700 a week , and application to leave have rise to 1900 a week . 
the official statistic show that 60 percent be employed worker or independent professional people . 
whole family are move and removal_firm be booked for month ahead . 
the weekly loss is partly counterbalance by 500 arrival each_week from location , but the hard truth , say person , be that `` the closing_off of location without interference from the west and with the use only of east_german , as distinct from russian , troops be a major communist victory , which deal location a deadly , possibly a fatal , blow . 
the gallant half city is die on_its_feet '' . 
another piece of evidence appear in a dispatch from bonn in the observer ( london ) . 
person write : `` people are leave [ location ] because they think it is die . 
they are leave so fast that the president of the location issue an appeal this week to factory_worker in the west to volunteer for six month ' front_line work in factory in location . 
berlin 's resilience be amazing , but if it has to hire its labor in the west the struggle will be hard indeed '' . 
the handwriting be on_the_wall . 
the only hope for location lie_in a compromise which will bring_down the wall and reunite the city . 
state_department official refuse to show their pass at the boundary , and drive two block into location under military escort , will not avail . 
tank line_up at the border will be no_more helpful . 
the material for compromise be at_hand : the nation , person and other sober commentator ( see person on p. 367 ) have spell_out them out again_and_again . 
a compromise will leave both side without the glow of triumph , but it will save location . 
or the city can be a graveyard monument to western intransigence , if that be what the west want . 
the removal of person 's body from the mausoleum he share with person to less distinguished quarters in the location wall is not unprecedented in history . 
it be , in_fact , a relatively mild chastisement of the dead . 
a british writer , person , in a book , dead_men_tell_tales , recall that in the turmoil precede french_revolution the body of person , , who had die nearly 180 year earlier , was tear to piece by a mob . 
and in location , after the restoration , the body of person was disinter and hang at location . 
the head was then fix on a pole at location , and the rest of the body was bury under the gallows . 
contemplate these posthumous punishment , person should not lose all hope . 
in 1899 , group erect a statue to person in location , face location and there , presumably , he still stand . 
person , however , has create yet another problem for himself . 
the person tomb be obviously adequate for double occupancy , moscow be a crowded city , and the creed of communism deplore waste . 
who will take person 's place beside person ? 
there is person , of_course , bury in london . 
the person government might be will to let_go_of him go , but he has be dead seventy-eight year and even the soviet mortician could not make him look presentable . 
who , then , be of sufficient stature to lodge with person ? 
who but person himself ? 
since he has just show who be top_dog , he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the soviet people . 
besides , he can hardly avoid muse on the instability of death which , what with exhumation and rehabilitation , seem to match that of life . 
suppose he did lie beside person , would it be permanent ? 
if some future person decide to rake_up the misdeed of his revered predecessor , would not the factory_worker pass the same resolution applaud his dispossession ? 
when a man is lay_to_rest , he is entitle to stay_put . 
if person buy a small plot in some modest rural cemetery , everyone will understand . 
the appointment of person of burma as the group acting secretary_general - at this writing , the choice appear to be certain - offer further proof that in politics it be more important to have no influential enemy than to have influential friend . 
person of tunisia and person of ireland be early favorite in_the_running , but france did n't like the former and the soviet_union would have none of the latter . 
with the neutralist maintain pressure for one of their own to succeed person , person emerge as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylay by a veto . 
what be interesting be that his positive qualification for the post were reveal only as a kind of tail to his candidacy . 
in all the bitter in-fighting , the squabble over election procedure , the complicated numbers_game that east and west play on the assistant secretary ' theme , the gentleman from burma show himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat . 
he have , moreover , another qualification which augur well for the future . 
he be a buddhist , which mean that to him peace and the sanctity of human life be not_only religious dogma , but a profound and unshakable weltanschauung . 
person of_course , will hold office until the spring of 1963 , when person 's term would have come to an end . 
whether the compromise - on both side - that make_possible the interim appointment can then be repeat remain to be see . 
person 's demand for a troika be dormant , not dead ; the west may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that person represent . 
in_a_sense , the showdown promise by person 's sudden and tragic death has been avoid ; no precedent have been set as_yet ; structurally , the group be still fluid , vulnerable to the pressure that its new and enlarged membership are bring_to_bear upon it . 
but at_least the pessimist who believe that the world_organization had plunge to its death in that plane crash in the congo have been prove wrong . 
no one who has study the radical right can suppose that words be their sole staple in trade . 
these be mentality which crave action - and they are begin to get_it , as person and person report on page 372 . 
even in area where political connotation are ( deliberately ? ) 
leave vague , the spirit of vigilantism is spread . 
friends , a picture magazine distribute by group dealer , describe a paramilitary_organization of employee of the group at location , location . 
`` if the day should ever come that foreign invader swarm ashore along the group '' , the account read , `` they can count_on heavy opposition from a group of commando trained telephone employee - all girl . 
heavily armed and mobilize as a fast moving civil_defense outfit , 23 telephone_operator and office personnel stand ready to move_into action at a minute 's notice '' . 
according_to friends , the unit was organize by person , a former world_war_/2 , commando who be vice_president and general_manager of the telephone_company . 
the girl , very fetching in their uniform , are show fire rocket from a launcher mount on a dump_truck ; they are also train with carbine , automatic weapon , pistol , rifle and other such lady ' accessory . 
this may be opera_bouffe now , but it will become more serious should the cold_war mount in frenzy . 
the country be committed to the doctrine of security by military means . 
the doctrine has never work ; it is not work now . 
the official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms ; it cannot bring them into actual play . 
a more dangerous formula for national frustration cannot be imagine . 
as the civic temper rise , the more naive citizen begin to play soldier - but the gun be real . 
soon they will begin to hunt_down the traitor they be assure be in our midst . 
it is not news that person be a wizard of the violin . 
certainly not in location where he has play countless recital , and where thursday night he celebrate his 20th season with the group , play the brahms_concerto with his own slashing , demon-ridden cadenza melt into the high , pale , pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlock the heart of the music , or forever find it closed . 
there be about that song something incandescent , for this location be person at white_heat . 
not the noble performance we have hear him play , or the most spacious , or even the most eloquent . 
those would be reserve for the orchestra 's great night when the soloist can surpass himself . 
this time the orchestra give him some superb support fire by response to his own high mood . 
but he have in person a willing conductor able only up to a point . 
that_is , when person thrust straight to the core of the music , spark fly , bow shred , violin singing , glitter and sometimes spit , person could go_along . 
but person does not go straight to any point . 
he flounder and let music sprawl . 
there be in the person none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist , orchestra and music to ultimate fusion . 
so we have some dazzling and memorable person , but not great person . 
the concert open with another big romantic score , person overture_to_manfred , which suffer fate , this time with orchestral thrust to the byronic point to keep it afloat . 
person 's joust with person tune be a considerably more serious misfortune , for it demand translucent texture , buoyant rhythm , and astringent wit . 
it get the kind of scrambled , coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestra when the man with the baton lack technique and style . 
the bayreuth_festival open july 23 with a new production of `` tannhaeuser '' stage by person , who is do all the opera this time , and conduct by person . 
person also conduct `` the_flying_dutch '' , open july 24 . 
`` parsifal '' follow july 25 , with person conduct , and he also conduct `` die_meistersinger '' , to be present aug 8 and 12 . 
the `` ring '' cycle be july 26 , 27 , 28 and 30 , and aug 21 , 22 , 23 and 25 . 
person conduct . 
no cast are list , but person send_word that the negro soprano , person , will sing venus in `` tannhaeuser '' . 
remember how by a series of booking absurdity chicago miss see the group ? 
remember how by lack of two big theater chicago miss the first visit of the group ? 
well , now we have two big theater . 
but bar a miracle , and do n't hold your breath for it , chicago will not see the group , which stem from the ballet cradle of the group and be one of the great company of the world . 
before you let_loose a howl say we announce its coming , not once but several time , indeed we did . 
the engagement was_supposed_to be all set for the big theater in location , which person , ballet booker extraordinary , consider the finest house of its kind in the country - and of_course he does n't weep at the capacity , either . 
it was all set . 
group corporation first list the chicago date as dec 4 thru 10 . 
later the person office make it dec 8 thru 17 , a nice , long booking for the full repertory . 
but if you keep a calendar of event , as we do , you notice a conflict . 
group had book person into location dec 8 and 9 . 
something had to give . 
not person . 
group then notify us that the group would cut_short its los_angeles booking , fly here to open nov 28 , and close dec 2 . 
short booking , but still a booking . 
we print it . 
a_couple_of day later a balletomane tell me he had telephone group for ticket information and was tell `` the newspaper had make a mistake '' . 
so i start make some call of my own . 
these be the result . 
the group is firmly book into the location , los_angeles , nov 21 thru dec 4 . 
not a chance of open here nov 28 - bar that miracle . 
then why not the juicy booking person had hold for us ? 
well , person won't budge from group . 
then how about the group ? 
well , group has book person there for a week start dec 4 . 
query about the impasse , group say : `` better cancel the group for_the_time_being . 
it 's all up_in_the_air again '' . 
so the group will fly back to russia , minus a chicago engagement , a serious loss for dance fan - and for the frustrated booker , cancellation of one of the rich booking in the country . 
will somebody please reopen the auditorium ? 
painting and drawing by person of location , virgin_islands , are show thru nov 5 at the location , 3211 location , weekday , 3 pm to 8 pm , sunday 3 pm to 6 pm , close monday . 
an exhibition of person 's painting will open with a reception nov 5 at the location , 828 location . 
it will continue all month . 
abstraction and semi abstraction by person are being exhibit by the location until nov 5 . 
in the line of operatic trade to cushion the budget , the group will use san_francisco 's new group production of `` lucia_di_lammermoor '' this season , return the favor next season when san_francisco use the dallas `` don_giovanni '' , design by person . 
person has scribble a farce called `` hark_,_hark_,_the_lark '' ! 
it be one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novel of the season . 
if there is a moral lurk among the shenanigan , it be hard to find . 
perhaps the lesson we should take from these page be that the welfare_state in england still allow wild scope for all kind of rugged eccentric . 
anyway , a number of them meet here in devastating collision . 
one be an imperial london stockbroker called person . 
another be a wily countryman called person , whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicle , i believe , in early volume of person ' comedie_humaine . 
what 's up now ? 
well , person and his wife person have reach the stage of affluence that stir a longing for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicity . 
they want to own a junior-grade castle , or a manor_house , or some modest little place where shakespeare might once have stage a pageant for person and all her bearded courtier . 
they are willing to settle , however , in anything that offer pheasant to shoot at and peasant to work_at . 
and of_course person have just the thing they want . 
it 's a horror . 
the name of_it be location , and it is surround by a wasteland that would impress person . 
that 's not precisely the way person urge them to look_at it , though . 
he conjure_up herd of deer , and wild bird crowd the air . 
he suggest that location embody all the glory of tudor splendor . 
the stained-glass_window may have develop unpremeditated patina , the paneling may be no more durable than the plank in a political_platform . 
the vast , dungeon kitchen may seem hardly worth use except on occasion when one is face with a_thousand unexpected guest for lunch . 
person have an answer to all that . 
the spaciousness of the tudor cooking area , for_example , will provide needed space for the extra television_set require by modern butler , cook and maid . 
also , perhaps , table_tennis and other indoor sport to keep them fit and contented . 
it 's a wonder , really , to how much mendacious trouble person put himself to sell the person that preposterous manse . 
he does n't really need the immense sum_of_money ( probably convert from american gold on the group ) he make them pay . 
for person is already wonderfully content with his lot . 
he have a glorious wife and many child . 
when he need money to buy something like , say , the rolls-royce he keep near his vegetable_patch , he takes_a_flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies . 
one of those capital_gain venture , in_fact , has saddle him with location . 
he is willing to sell it just to get_it_off_his_hands . 
and the person are more_than willing to buy it . 
they plan to become county people who know the proper way to terminate a fox 's life on earth . 
if , in person 's eye , they be nothing but location farmer , he have as much to learn about them as they have to learn about the way of truly rural living . 
person show us how this mutual education spread its inevitable havoc . 
one-upmanship is practice by both side in a total war . 
first the person be ahead , then the person . 
after person has been persuade to restock his tangled acres with pheasant , he poach only what he need for the nourishment of his family and local caller . 
one of the local caller , a retired brigadier apparently left_over from kipling 's tale of india , do not approve of the way person get his bird . 
he does n't think that pot them from a deck_chair on the south_side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting . 
but the brigadier dine on the bird with relish . 
it is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet make from person ' `` don_quixote '' be the brilliant russian spectacle , do in wide-screen and color , which open yesterday at the location and group . 
more_than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventure and escapade of the tragicomic knight-errant and his squire , person , in seventeenth century spain , this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry be an affectingly warm and human exposition of character . 
person , the russian actor who has play such_as heroic role as person and person , perform the lanky don_quixote , and does so with a simple dignity that bridge the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man . 
his addlebrained knight-errant , self appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegate to museum and the chivalrous code of knight_errantry had become a joke , be , as person no_doubt intend , a gaunt but gracious symbol of good , move soberly and sincerely in a world of cynic , hypocrite and rogue . 
person does not caricature him , as some actor have been incline to do . 
he treat this deep-eyed , bearded , bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect . 
direct by person in a tempo that is studiously slow , he develop a sense of a high tradition shine brightly and pass gravely through an impious world . 
the complexity of communication have been considerably abet in this case by appropriately stilted english_language that has been excellently dub in_place_of the russian dialogue . 
the voice of all the character , include that of person , have richness , roughness or color to conform with the personality . 
and the subtlety of the dialogue are most helpfully convey . 
since russian was being speak instead of spanish , there be no violation of artistry or logic here . 
splendid , too , be the performance of person , one of russia 's leading comedian , as person , the fat , grotesque `` squire '' . 
though his character be broad and more comically rounded than the don , he give it a firmness and toughness - a sort_of peasant dignity - too . 
it be really as though the russian have see in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoon . 
the episode in which person conclude the joke that is play on him when he be facetiously put in command of an `` island '' be one of the best in the film . 
true , the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary quality that be a_bit wearisome in the first_half , before don_quixote go to the duke 's court . 
but strength and poignancy develop thenceforth , and the windmill and deathbed episode gather the thread of realization of the wonderfulness of the old_boy . 
there be other good representation of peasant and people of the court by actor who are finely costume and magnificently photograph in this last of the russian film to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange . 
also on the bill at the location be a nice ten minute color film called `` sunday_in_greenwich_village '' , a tour of the haunt and joint . 
television has yet to work_out a living_arrangement with jazz , which come to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family . 
there seem to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of chicago style jazz in prime_time evening time , for_example , could not be justify without the trimming of a portentous documentary . 
at_least this seem to be the working hypothesis for `` chicago and all that jazz '' , present on group - tv nov 26 . 
the program come_out of the group special project department , and was slot in the du_pont_show of the week series . 
perhaps special project necessarily think along documentary line . 
if so , it might be worthwhile to assign a future jazz show to a different department - one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut_down on the number of performer and give them a_little room to display their talent . 
as_a_matter_of_fact , this latter approach has already been try , and with pleasing result . 
a_few year ago a `` group all star jazz show '' offer a broad range of style , range from person 's big_band to the freewheeling group . 
an enthusiastic audience confirm the `` live '' character of the hour , and provide the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seem to improve the quality of performance . 
about that same time person 's tv series on the popular art prove again that give jazz ample breathing_space be one of the most sensible thing a producer can do . 
in an hour remember for its almost rudderless movement , a score of jazz luminary go before the camera for lengthy period . 
the program had been arrange to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music . 
camera stare at soloist ' face in extreme closeup , then considerately pull_back for full view of ensemble work . 
`` chicago and all_that_jazz '' could not be fault on the choice of artist . 
some of the in-person performer be person , person , person , person , person , person , person , person , person . 
the jazz buff could hardly ask for more . 
furthermore , person make an ideal master_of_ceremonies . 
( he play host at the group show already mention . ) 
one of the script 's big problem be how to blend picture and music of the past with live performance by musician of today . 
group had gather a_lot of historical material which it be eager to share . 
for_example , there be sheet_music with the word `` jazz '' in the title , to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin take_hold . 
sample zoom into closeup range in regular succession , like telephone_pole pass on the highway , while representative music reinforce the mood of the late teens and 1920 's . 
however well-chosen and cleverly arrange , such memorabilia unfortunately amount to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening 's main business , which ( consider the talent at_hand ) should probably have be the gathering of fresh sample of the chicago style . 
another source of group pride be its rare film_clip of person , but this view of the great trumpeter fly_by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blot_out the entire glimpse . 
similarly , in present still photograph of early jazz_group , the program allow no time for a close perusal . 
`` chicago and all that jazz '' may have wind_up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer . 
by try to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today 's artist , the program turn_out to be a not quite perfect example of either . 
still , the network 's willingness to experiment in this musical field be to be commend , and future essay happily anticipate . 
even person may not have anticipate the tremendous reception she receive from the metropolitan_opera audience attend her debut as person in person 's `` lucia_di_lammermoor '' sunday night . 
the crowd stage its own mad scene in salvo of cheer and applause and finally a standing_ovation as person take curtain_call after curtain_call following a fantastic `` mad_scene '' create on_her_own and with the help of the composer and the other performer . 
her entrance in scene_2_,_act_1 , bring some disconcerting applause even before she had sing a note . 
thereafter the audience wax applause happy , but discriminating operagoer reserve judgment as her singing show sign of strain , her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization . 
as she gain composure during the second act , her technical resourcefulness emerge strong , though she had already reveal a trill almost unprecedented in year of performance of `` lucia '' . 
she top the sextet brilliantly . 
each high note have the crowd in ecstasy so that it stop the show midway in the `` mad_scene '' , but the real reason be a realization of the extraordinary performance unfold at the moment . 
person appear almost as another person in this scene : a much more girlish person , a sensational coloratura who run across stage while singing , and an actress immerse in her role . 
what follow the outburst bring almost breathless silence as person reveal her mastery of a voice probably unique among soprano today . 
this big , flexible voice with uncommon range has been superbly disciplined . 
nervousness at_the_start must have cause the blemish of her first scene , or she may warm_up slowly . 
in the fullness of her vocal splendor , however , she could sing the famous scene magnificently . 
technically it be fascinating , aurally spellbinding , and dramatically quite realistic . 
many year have pass since a metropolitan audience hear anything comparable . 
her debut over , perhaps the early scene will emerge equally fine . 
the performance also mark the debut of a most promising young conductor , person . 
he inject more vitality into the score than it has reveal in many year . 
he may respect too_much the italian tradition of let singer hold_on to their note , but to restrain them in a singer ' opera may be quite difficult . 
person sing person in glorious voice . 
his bel_canto style give the performance a special distinction . 
the remainder of the cast fulfill its assignment no more_than satisfactorily just as the old production and limited stage_direction prove only serviceable . 
person first sing person at location in 1959 . 
( the first group broadcast on dec 9 will introduce her as person . ) 
she has since turn_to person , whose opera `` beatrice_di_tenda '' in a concert version with the group introduce her to new_york last season . 
she will sing `` la_sonambula '' with it here next week . 
anyone for musical ping-pong ? 
it 's really quite fun as_long_as you like game . 
you will need a stereo music system , with speaker preferably place at_least seven or eight foot apart , and one or more of the new london `` phase 4 '' record . 
there be 12 of these to choose from , all_of them of popular_music except for the star release , pass_in_review ( sp 44001 ) . 
this feature the march song of several nation , record as though the various national band were march by your reviewing_stand . 
complete with crowd effect , interruption by jet_plane , and sundry other touch of realism , this disc display london 's new technique to the good effect . 
all_of the jacket carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program . 
no reference is make to the possibility of record other_than popular_music in this manner , and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious_music . 
directionality is greatly exaggerate most_of the time ; but when the sound of the two speaker are allow to mix , there be excellent depth and dimension to the music . 
you definitely hear some of the instrument close_up and others far back , with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instrument merely be loud than the ones far back . 
this be a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantage over monaural sound . 
group explain that the very distinct directional effect in the phase 4 series be due in large part to their novel method of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channel . 
these are then mix by their sound engineer with the active cooperation of the musical staff and combine into the final two channel which are impress on the record . 
in some of the number the instrumental part have even been record at different time and then later combine on the master tape to produce special_effect . 
some clue to the character of group 's approach in these disc may be gain immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 title include the word `` percussion '' or `` percussive '' . 
drum , xylophone , castanets , and other percussive_instrument are reproduce remarkably well . 
only_too often , however , you have the feeling that you are sit in a room with some of the instrument line_up on one wall to your left and others face them on the wall to your right . 
they be definitely in the same room with you , but your head start to swing as though you were sit on the very edge of a tennis_court watch a spirited volley . 
the percussive twenties ( sp 44006 ) stir pleasant memory with well-known song of that day , and person 's kombo give_forth with tingle jazz in percussive_moods ( sp 44005 ) . 
big_band_percussion ( sp 44002 ) seem one of the least attractive disc - the arrangement just did n't have so much character as the others . 
there be an extraordinary sense of presence in all of these recording , apparently obtain at_least in part by emphasize the middle and high_frequency . 
the penalty for this be noticeable in the big , bold , brilliant , but brassy piano sound in melody_and_percussion_for_two_pianos ( sp 44007 ) . 
all_of the release , however , are record at a gratifyingly high level , with resultant masking of any surface_noise . 
pass_in_review practically guarantee enjoyment , and be a dramatic demonstration of the potentiality of any stereo music system . 
many hollywood film manage somehow to be authentic , but not realistic . 
strange , but true - authenticity and realism often are n't relate at_all . 
almost every film bear the imprimatur of hollywood be physically authentic - in_fact , impeccably so . 
in any given period_piece the costume , bric-a-brac , vehicle , and decor , bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity . 
the major studio maintain a cadre of film librarian and research specialist who look to this matter . 
during the making recently of an important biblical film , some 40 volume of research material and sketch not_only of costume and interior , but of architectural development , sports_arena , vehicle , and other paraphernalia were compile , consult , and comply with . 
but , alas , the authenticity seem to stop at the set 's edge . 
the drama itself - and this seem to be lavishly true of biblical drama - often have hardly any relationship with authenticity at_all . 
the storyline , in sort , be wildly unrealistic . 
thus , in `` the_story_of_ruth '' we have person , person , and person and set that be meticulously authentic . 
but except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline - i.e. , that person remain with person and finally wind_up with person - the film version have little to do with the bible . 
and in the new `` king_of_kings '' the plot involve intrigue and twist and turn that cannot be trace to the gospels . 
earlier this month person , director of the group , come to hollywood and have dinner with more_than 100 leader of the motion_picture industry . 
he talk_about unauthentic storyline too . 
he intimate that they were n't do_good the country much good in the cold_war . 
and to an industry that pride itself on authenticity , he urge great realism . 
`` in many corner of the globe '' , he say , `` the major source of impression about this country be in the movie they meet . 
would we want a future_day person or person recount the saga of america with movie as his prime source of knowledge ? 
yet for much of the globe , hollywood be just that - prime , if_not sole , source of knowledge . 
if a man totally ignorant of america were to judge our land and its civilization base on hollywood alone , what conclusion do you think he might come_to ? 
the group , location , present `` king_of_hearts '' by person and person . 
direct by person ; setting by person . 
the cast : 
person has choose a delightful comedy for his season 's opener at location in person 's `` king_of_hearts '' . 
the dialogue be sharp , witty and candid - typical `` do n't eat the daisy '' material - which has stamp the author throughout her book and play , and it be obvious that the theatre-by-the-sea audience like it . 
the story be of a famous strip cartoonist , an arty individual , whose specialty be the american boy and who adopt a 10 - year old to provide him with fresh idea material . 
this be when his trouble begin , not_to_mention a fledgling artist who he hire , and who turn_out to have idea of his own , with particular respect_to the hero 's sweetheart secretary . 
person , play person , the cartoonist , carries_the_show in marvelous fashion . 
his portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist be virtually flawless . 
this may be unfortunate , perhaps , from the standpoint of person , providence 's contribution to location , who is appear by special arrangement with group . 
not that person does not make the most of his role . 
he does , and more . 
but the book is write around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist , and it has to be that way . 
a word should be say for person , a broadway youngster who , as the adopted son , make life miserable for nearly everybody and person in particular . 
and for his playmate , person of location , who have a bit_part , person . 
on_the_whole , audience will like this performance . 
it be a tremendous book , lively , constantly moving , and the location cast do_well by it . 
the group present `` epitaph_for_george_dillon '' by person and person , direct by person . 
the cast : 
the angry young_man in newport last night be at the group , where `` epitaph_for_george_dillon '' open as the jazz_festival close . 
for the hero of this work by person and person be a chap embitter by more than the lack of beer during a jam_session . 
he 's mad at a world he did not make . 
furthermore , he 's something of a scoundrel , an artist whose mind and feeling be all fingertip . 
this be in contrast to the family with whom he board . 
they not_only think and feel cliche but live cliche as_well . 
it is into this household , one erode by irritation that have torture the soul out of its people , that person enter at the beginning of the play . 
an unsuccessful playwright and actor , he have faith only in himself and in a talent he be not sure exist . 
by the end of the third act , the artist be dead but the body linger on , a shell among other shell . 
not altogether a successful play , `` epitaph_for_george_dillon '' overcome through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling . 
it be awfully talky , for_instance , and not all_of the talk be terribly impressive . 
but it strike spark on_occasion and their light cause all else to be forget . 
there be a fine second act , as an example , one in which person , as person , have an opportunity to blaze_away in one impassioned passage after another . 
this be an exciting young actor to watch . 
just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way be person , whose complete control of her every movement be lovely to watch . 
person be as intensely vibrant as one could wish , almost an icy shriek threaten to explode at any moment . 
also fine be person , as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female spider and just as destructive , person , as her scratchy spouse , and person , as a vegetable in human form . 
person has direct a difficult play here , usually well , but with just a_bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste . 
still , his finale is put_together with taste and a most sensitive projection of that pale sustenance , despair . 
group present `` where's_charley ? '' 
with music and lyric by person , direct by person , choreography by person , musical direction by person . 
the cast : 
everybody fall_in_love with person again last night at the location , and person be to blame . 
one of the finest soft-shoe tune ever invent , `` once_in_love_with_amy '' be also , of_course , one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love_lyric to come_out of american musical_comedy in our era . 
so the audience last night be all ear and eye just after act 2 , get a rousing opening chorus , `` where's_charley ? '' 
, and person sifted_out all alone on the stage with the amble chord and beat of the song just whisper into being . 
it be greatly to person 's credit that he make no attempt to outdo person . 
he drop his earlier and delightful hamming , which be about the only way to handle the old warhorse called `` charley's_aunt '' , and let himself go_with as an appealing an `` person '' as anybody could ask . 
in_brief , person play himself and not person . 
the big audience start applaud even before he had finish . 
the whole production this week be fresh and lively . 
the costume be stunning evocation of the voluminous gown and picture_hat of the gibson_girl day . 
the ballet work be on_the_nose , especially in the opening number by `` group and group '' , along with a fiery and sultry brazilian fantasia later . 
person , whose fame has rest_on in recent year on his skill as a nightclub monologist , prove himself very much at_home in musical_comedy . 
sparrow size person , with sparkling blue eye and a cheerful smile , make a suitably perky person , while person , as the real aunt , be positively monumental in the very best gibson_girl manner . 
all_told , `` where's_charley ? '' ought not to be miss . 
it have a fast pace , excellent music , expert direction , and not_only a good comedian , but an appealing person in his own right , person . 
the group present person 's and person 's production of `` fiorello ! '' 
at location . 
the book be by person and person , music by person , lyric by person , choreography by person , scenery , costume and lighting by person and person , musical direction by person , and the production was direct by person . 
the cast : 
this be one of the happy event of the season . 
the company which perform the pulitzer_prize musical here last night and will repeat it twice today be full of bounce , the politician be in fine voice , the chorine evoke happy memory , and the person ride to break a lance again . 
i see `` fiorello ! '' perform in new_york by the original cast and i think this company be every_bit as good , and perhaps better . 
certainly in the matter of principal there be nothing lacking . 
person may not bear quite as close a physical resemblance to person as person does , but i be amazed at the way he become more_and_more person as the evening progress , until one had to catch_one's_self_up and remember that this be n't really person come_back among us again . 
then person be simply grand as person , the distraught group district chieftain . 
and person , as person , the faithful one who never get home to his person 's dinner , be fine , too . 
as for the lady , they be full of charm , and sincerity , and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving , honest , little man . 
person be excellent as the loyal person , who become the second person , sing and acting with remarkable conviction . 
person , as person , his first wife , manage to make that short role impressive . 
and little person , a person with real spirit and verve , be fascinating whether she was sing of her love for person , the cop who become sewer commissioner and then is promote into garbage , or just dance to display her exuberant feeling . 
such fascinating novelty in the score as the fugal treatment of `` on_the_side_of_the_angels '' and `` politics_and_poker '' were handle splendidly , and i think person and his band of tuneful ward-heeler make `` little_tin_box '' even better than it was do by the new_york cast ; all the words of its clever lyric come_through with perfect clarity . 
the party at person 's penthouse give the `` chorine '' a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed routine which have become a classic choreographic statement of the era 's nonsense . 
person 's multi lingual rally , when he is run for group , be well staged , and wind_up in a wild jewish folk_dance that be really great musical_theater . 
person has establish quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring production . 
not a cut_corners has been visibly cut in this one . 
the set be remarkably elaborate for a road_show that does n't pause long in any one place , and they are devise so_that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness . 
( several time recently i have wonder whether show were being stage for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery being shift right in_front_of their eye . 
i'm glad to say there 's none of that distraction in this `` fiorello ! '' 
) 
it has all been done in superb style , and the result be a show which deserve the support of every person hereabouts who enjoy good musical_theater . 
group present `` where_the_boys_are '' , an group picture produce by person and direct by person from a screenplay by person . 
the cast : 
since the hero , a sterling and upright fellow , be a rich group senior , while two person are cast as virtual rapist , i suppose i should disqualify myself from sit in judgment on `` where_the_boys_are '' , but i shall do nothing of the sort . 
instead - and not just to prove my objectivity - i hasten to report that it 's a highly amusing film which probably do a fairly accurate job of report on the easter vacation shenanigan of collegian down in location , and that it seem to come_to_grips quite honestly with the moral problem that most commonly vex youngster in this age_group - that_is_to_say , sex . 
the answer the girl give strike me as reasonably varied and healthily individual . 
if most_of them be n't exactly specific - well , that 's the way it be in life , i guess . 
but at_least it 's reassuring to see some teenager who do n't profess to know all the answer and are think_about their problem instead . 
`` where_the_boys_are '' also have a juvenile bounce that make_for a refreshing venture in comedy . 
there be some sharp and whipping line and some hilariously funny situation - the best of the latter be a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where a `` mermaid '' is perform . 
most of the female face be new , or at_least not too familiar . 
person , be charming in a leading role , and quite believable . 
i be delighted with person ' comedy performance , which be as fresh and unstilted as one 's highest hope might ask . 
a_couple_of the male make good comedy , too - person and person . 
the only performance which be too soft for me be that of person , but since someone had to become the victim of despoiler , just to emphasize that such thing do happen at these fracas , i suppose this be the attitude the part call_for . 
i must say , however , that i prefer the acting that have something of a biting edge to it . 
to anyone who remember newport at its less_than maximum violence , this view of what the boy and girl do in the springtime before they wing north for the jazz_festival ought to prove entertaining . 
the second feature , `` the_price_of_silence '' , be a british detective_story that will talk_your_head_off . 
as a result , although we still make use of this distinction , there be much confusion as_to the meaning of the basic term employ . 
just what is mean by `` spirit '' and by `` matter '' ? 
the term are generally taken_for_granted as though they refer to direct and axiomatic element in the common experience of all . 
yet in the contemporary context this be precisely what one must_not do . 
for in the modern_world neither `` spirit '' nor `` matter '' refer to any generally agreed_upon element of experience . 
we be in a transitional stage in which many_of the connotation of former usage have had_to be revise or reject . 
when the word are use , we be never sure which of the traditional meaning the user may have_in_mind , or to_what_extent his revision and rejection of former understanding correspond to ours . 
one of the most widespread feature of contemporary thought be the almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit . 
just a_few century ago the world of spirit be as populous and real as the world of material entity . 
not_only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as_well be this true . 
demon , fairy , angel , and a host of other spiritual_being be as much a part of the experiential world of western man as be rock and tree and star . 
in such a world the word `` matter '' and `` spirit '' both refer to directly known reality in the common experience of all . 
in it important element of christianity and of the biblical view of reality in_general , which now cause us much difficulty , could be respond to quite naturally and spontaneously . 
the progress of science over these last few century and the gradual replacement of biblical by scientific category of reality have to a large extent empty the spirit_world of the entity which previously populate it . 
in carry_out this program science has undoubtedly perform a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit . 
the objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly go far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support . 
science be fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arise from an object in space and time . 
when , therefore , it turn its attention to the concrete entity with which popular imagination had people the world of spirit , these entity soon lose whatever status they had enjoy as actual element of external reality . 
in doing so science has unquestionably clear_up widespread misconception , remove extraneous and illusory source of fear , and dispel many undesirable popular superstition . 
there have be , indeed , many important and valuable gain from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful . 
all this has not , however , be an unmixed blessing . 
the scientific debunking of the spirit_world has be in_a_way too successful and too thorough . 
the house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been leave with no means , or at_best with wholly inadequate means , for deal with his experience of spirit . 
although the particular form of conceptualization which popular imagination had make in response to the experience of spirit be undoubtedly defective , the raw experience itself which lead to such excess remain with us as vividly as ever . 
we simply find ourselves in the position of have no means for inquire into the structure and meaning of this range of our experience . 
there be no framework or structure of thought with_respect_to which we can organize it and no part of reality , as we know and apprehend it , with_respect_to which we can refer this experience . 
science has simply leave us helpless and powerless in this important sector of our life . 
the situation in which we find ourselves is bring_out with dramatic force in person 's play the_crucible , which deal with the location witch trial . 
as the play open the audience is introduce to the community of location in puritan america at the end of the eighteenth century . 
aside_from a quaint concern with witch and devil which provide the immediate problem in the opening scene , it be a quite normal community . 
the conversation of the character create an atmosphere suggest the usual mixture of pleasure , foible , irritation , and concern which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age . 
there be no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people . 
instead , the audience can sit_back at_ease and , from the perspective of an enlightened time which no_longer believe_in such thing , enjoy the dead seriousness with which the character in the play take the witch and devil which be under discussion . 
a teenage girl , person , is being sharply question by her minister uncle , the person , about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girl had seemed to have have contact with these evil being . 
for all involved in this discussion the devil be a real entity who can really be confront in the woods on a dark night , the demon world is populated with real creature , and witch actually can be see fly through the air . 
as the play unfold , however , the audience is subtly bring into the grip of an awful evil which grow with ominously gather power and soon engulf the community . 
everyone in location , saint and sinner alike , is sweep_up by it . 
it be like a mysterious epidemic which , start first with person and person , spread inexorably with a dreadfully grow virulence through the whole town until all have been infect by it . 
it grow terribly and unavoidably in power and leave in its wake a trail of misery , moral disintegration , and destruction . 
the audience leave the play under a spell , it be the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active manifestation always evoke . 
if one ask about this play , what it be that come_upon this community and work within it with such terrible power , there be no better answer to give than `` spirit '' . 
this be not to attempt to say what spirit be , but only to employ a commonly use word to designate or simply identify a common experience . 
in_the_end the good man , person , express what the audience has already come to feel when he say , `` a fire , a fire is burn ! 
i hear the boot of lucifer , i see his filthy face '' ! 
the tragic irony of the play be that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be meet in the woods and combat with formula set_out in book be the very thing that prevent them from detect the real devil when he come among them . 
we marvel at their blindness for not see this . 
yet be not we of the mid twentieth century , who rightly do not believe there be any such `` thing '' as the devil , just as bad off as they - only in a different way ? 
in our disbelief we think that we can no_longer even use the word and so be unable to even name the elemental power which be so vividly real in_this play . 
we are leave helpless to cope_with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredit and prove false . 
even person himself seem uncertain on this score . 
in a long commentary which he has insert in the published text of the first act of the play , he say at one point : `` however , that experience never raise a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of lucifer 's many faced lieutenant . 
and his belief be not to his discredit . 
better mind than person 's be - and still be - convinced that there be a society of spirit beyond our ken '' . 
( page 33 ) on_the_other_hand , a_little later_on he say : 
`` since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped_out god 's beard and the devil 's horn , but the world is still grip between two diametrically oppose absolute . 
the concept of unity , in which positive and negative be attribute of the same force , in which good and evil be relative , ever-changing , and always joined to the same phenomenon - such a concept is still reserve to the physical_science and to the few who have grasp the history of idea . 
when we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man 's worthlessness - until redeem - the necessity of the devil may become evident as a weapon , a weapon design and use time_and_time_again in every age to whip man into a surrender to a particular church or church-state '' . 
apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think_of the devil as be actually real . 
yet such_that be the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless leave in the grip of the terrible power and potency of that which come over location . 
it cast a spell upon them so_that they leave with a feeling of having be in the mysterious presence of an evil power . 
it be not enough in account_for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people add together to produce a cumulative effect . 
for this does not account_for the integral , elemental power of that which grow with abounding vigor as the play unfold , nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which come over those who watch the play like a spell . 
the reality of spirit emerge in_this play in_spite_of the author 's conviction to_the_contrary . 
there be nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely know and universally feel than spirit . 
apart from spirit there could be no community , for it be spirit which draw man into community and give to any community its unity , cohesiveness , and permanence . 
think , for_example , of the spirit of the marine_corps . 
surely this be a reality we all acknowledge . 
we cannot , of_course , assign it any substance . 
it be not material and be not a `` thing '' occupy space and time . 
yet it exist and have an objective reality which can be experience and know . 
so it be too with many other spirit which we all know : the spirit of nazism or communism , school spirit , the spirit of a street_corner gang or a football_team , the spirit of group or the ku_klux_klan . 
every community , if it be alive have a spirit , and that spirit be the center of its unity and identity . 
in search for clue which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit , the close connection between spirit and community be likely to prove the most fruitful . 
for it be primarily in community that we know and experience spirit . 
it be spirit which give life to a community and cause it to cohere . 
it be the spirit which be the source of a community 's drawing_power by means of which others are draw into it from the world outside so_that the community grow and prosper . 
yet the spirit which live in community be not identical with the community . 
the idea of community and the idea of spirit be two distinct and separable idea . 
one characteristic of the spirit in community be its givenness . 
the member of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and wait for them . 
it be for them a given which they and they alone possess . 
the spirit of the marine_corps be present and operative before any of the present member of_it come into it . 
it be they , of_course , who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the marine_corps for future recruit to find as they come into it . 
if the content of faith is to be present today in a form that can be `` understand of the people '' - and this , it must_not be forget , be one of the goal of the perennial theological task - there be no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation . 
this does not mean that mythological language as_such can no_longer be use in theology and preaching . 
the absurd notion that demythologization entail the expurgation of all mythological concept completely misrepresent person 's intention . 
his point be not that mythology may_not be use , but that it may no_longer be regard_as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for express the christian kerygma . 
when we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandon , we mean it must be abandon as the sole or proper means for present the christian understanding of existence . 
mythological concept may by_all_means still be use , but they can be use responsibly only as `` symbol '' or `` cipher '' , that_is , only if they are also constantly interpret in non mythological ( or existential ) term . 
the statement is often made that when person argue in this way , he `` overestimate the intellectual stumbling_block which myth be supposed to put in the way of accept the christian faith '' . 
but this statement be completely unconvincing . 
if person 's own definition of myth is strictly adhere to ( and it be interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncement ) , the evidence be overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concept of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant . 
nor be it necessary to look_for such evidence in the great urban_center of our culture that be admittedly almost entirely secularize and so profoundly estranged from the conventional form in which the gospel has been communicate . 
on_the_contrary , even in the heart of `` the bible_belt '' itself , as can be attest by any one who is call to work there , the industrial_revolution and technological_revolution have long be underway , together with the corresponding change in man 's picture of himself and his world . 
in_fact , it be in just such a situation that the profundity of person 's argument is disclose . 
although the theological form of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation , the striking thing be the rapidity with which they are being reduce to a marginal existence . 
this be especially in_evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle_class . 
time_and_again in counseling and teaching , one encounter member of this group whose attempt to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythology of their `` fundamentalist '' heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern_world be only_too painfully obvious . 
the same thing is also evidence by the extreme `` culture protestantism '' so often observe to characterize the preaching and teaching of the american church . 
in the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be express , the unavoidable need to demythologize it make use of whatever resource be at_hand - and this usually mean one or another of the various form of `` folk religion '' current in the situation . 
this be not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with person 's `` cult of reassurance '' or the other type of a purely cultural christianity be the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel . 
but it be to say that this need be far more important for such infatuation than most_of the pundit seem to have suspect . 
however , even if the latent demand for demythologization be not nearly as widespread as we are claim , at_least among the cultured element of the population there tend to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace . 
to_be_sure , when this is point_out , a common response among certain churchman be to fulminate about `` the little flock '' and `` the great crowd '' and to take solace from person 's castigation of the `` wisdom of the wise '' in the opening chapter of first_corinthians . 
but can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indignation ? 
can the church risk assume that the `` folly '' of man be as dear to god as their `` wisdom '' , or , as is also commonly imply , that `` the foolishness of god '' and `` the foolishness of man '' be simply two way of talk_about the same thing ? 
can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gift we so desperately need and apart from whose cooperation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious ? 
there be an ancient and venerable tradition in the church ( which derive , however , from the heritage of the greek rather than from the bible ) that god be completely independent of his creation and so have no need of man for accomplish his work in the world . 
by analogy , the church also has been regard_as entirely independent of the `` world '' in the sense of require nothing from it in_order to be the church . 
but , as scripture everywhere remind us , god does have need of his creature , and the church , a_fortiori , can ill afford to do without the talent with which the world , by god 's providence , present it . 
and yet this be exactly the risk we run when we assume , as we too often do , that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that make it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured man . 
until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened man today can understand , we are deprive ourselves of the very resource on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depend . 
in argue in this way , we are obviously take for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieve ; and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set_forth reason to justify such a conviction . 
but the main point here be that even if such a restatement be not possible , the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable . 
this be what we mean when we say this demand must be accept without condition . 
if to be a christian mean to say yes where i otherwise say no , or where i do not have the right to say anything at_all , then my only choice be to refuse to be a christian . 
express differently : if the price for become a faithful follower of jesus_christ be some form of self-destruction , whether of the body or of the mind - sacrificium corporis , sacrificium intellectus - then there be no alternative but that the price remain unpaid . 
this must be stress because it be absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter . 
modern man , as person has tell us , has `` come_of_age '' ; and though this process by_no_means represent an unambiguous gain and is , in_fact , mark by the estrangement from the depth that seem to be the cost of human maturation , it be still a positive step forward ; and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it . 
in_any_event , it be an irreversible step , and if we be at_all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which god has seen_fit to place us . 
to say this , of_course , be to take_up a position on one side of a controversy go_on now for some two hundred year , or , at_any_rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought . 
we have align ourselves with that `` liberal '' tradition in protestant christianity that count among the great name in its history those of person , person , person , person , and person , and more recently , person and the early person and , in part at_least , person . 
it be to this same tradition that most_of the creative figure in the last century and a half of american theology also belong_to . 
for we must number here not_only the name of person , person , and person , not_to_mention those of `` the group '' and person , but those of the brother person and ( if america may claim him ! ) 
person as_well . 
finally , we may also mention the several member of the self-consciously `` neoliberal '' movement that develop at the group and be heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of person . 
what make this long and diverse tradition essentially one be that those who have belong_to it have be profoundly in_earnest about be modern man in a distinctively modern_world . 
although they have also been concern to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church , they have exhibit no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their christianity . 
they have insist , rather , on live fully and completely within modern culture and , so far from consider this treason to god , have look_upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him . 
when we say , then , that today , in our situation , the demand for demythologization must be accept without condition , we are simply say that at_least this much of the liberal tradition be an enduring achievement . 
however much we may have to criticize liberal theology 's constructive formulation , the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism , not behind it . 
in affirm this we have already take the decisive step in break the deadlock into which person 's attempt to formulate such a theology has lead . 
for we have say , in_effect , that of the two alternative to his position variously represent by the other participant in the demythologize discussion , only one be really an alternative . 
if the demand for demythologization be unavoidable and so must be accept by theology unconditionally , the position of the `` right '' be clearly untenable . 
whereas person 's `` center '' position be structurally inconsistent and be therefore indefensible on formal ground alone , the general position of the `` right '' , as represent , say , by person , involve the rejection or at_least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidate on the material ground we have just consider . 
it follow , then , provided the possibility have been exhaust , that the only real alternative be the general viewpoint of the `` left '' , which has been represent on the continent by person and , to some extent at_least , is find in much that be significant in american and english theology . 
in_order to make the implication of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length . 
we may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other_than the three typically represent by person , person , and person . 
to do this , it be sufficient to point_out that if the principle in_terms_of which alternative are to be conceive be such_as to exclude more_than two , then the question of a `` third '' possibility be a meaningless question . 
thus , if what be at_issue be whether `` all s be p '' , it be indifferent whether `` some s be not p '' or `` no s be p '' , since in either case the judgment in_question be false . 
hence , if what be in_question be whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely reject , it be unimportant whether only a_little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accept ; for , in either event , the first possibility is exclude . 
therefore , the only conceivable alternative be those represent , on_the_one_hand , by the two at_least apparently self-consistent but mutually_exclusive position of person and person and , on_the_other_hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of person . 
a second point require more extended comment . 
it will be recall from the discussion in section 7 that the position of the `` right '' , as represent by person , rest_on the following thesis : the only tenable alternative to person 's position be a theology that ( 1 ) reject or at_least qualify his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation ; ( 2 ) accept instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation ; and ( 3 ) in so doing , free itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event jesus_christ by means of statement that , from person 's point_of_view , be mythological . 
one_hundred year ago there exist in england the group . 
represent as_it_did the effort of only unauthorized individual of the roman_church and anglican_church , and urge a communion of prayer unacceptable to rome , this association produce little fruit , and , in_fact , was condemn by the group in 1864 . 
now again in 1961 , in england , there be perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discuss as christian unity . 
the group , january 18 - 25 , be enthusiastically devote to prayer and discussion by the various church . 
many people seem hopeful , yet it be difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of christian unity in 1961 than there be in 1861 . 
but it must be readily see that the religious picture in england has so greatly change during these hundred year as to engender hope , at_least on the catholic side . 
for `` the_tide_is_well_on_the_turn '' , as the group has write . 
i come to england last summer to do research on the unpublished letter of person . 
as an american catholic of irish ancestry , i come with certain preconception and expectation ; being intellectually influence by person and the general 19th century literature of england , i know only a protestant dominated country . 
since arrive here , however , i have form a far different religious picture of present-day england . 
in represent part of this new picture , i will be recount some of my own personal experience , reaction and judgment ; but my primary aim is to transcribe what englishman themselves are say and write and imply about the roman_church and anglican_church and about the present religious state of england . 
since the protestant clergy for_the_most_part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit , my roman_collar and black garb usually identify me in england as a roman_catholic cleric . 
in_any_case , i have always been treat with the utmost courtesy by englishman , even in location and location , where anti catholic feeling has supposedly exist the strong and long . 
nowhere have i see public expression of anti-catholicism . 
on my first guy_fawkes_day here , i find catholic as well as non catholic celebrate with the traditional firework and bonfire , and was tell that most englishman either do not know or be not concerned with the historical significance of the day . 
a birmingham newspaper print in a column for child an article entitle `` the true story of person '' , which begin : 
`` when you pile your '' guy `` on the bonfire tomorrow night , i wonder how much of the true story of person you will remember ? 
in the 355 year since the first guy_fawkes_night , much of the story has been forget , so here be a reminder '' . 
the article proceed to give an inaccurate account of a catholic plot to kill person , . 
in_spite_of the increase in number and prestige bring_about by the conversion of person and other tractarian of the 1840 's and 1850 's , the catholic segment of england one_hundred year ago be a very small one ( four percent , or 800000 ) which did not enjoy a gracious hearing from the general public . 
the return of the catholic hierarchy in 1850 was look_upon with indignant disapprobation and , in_fact , was charge with be a gesture of disloyalty . 
in 1864 person professedly had to write his apologia with his keen feelings in_order_to be believe and to command a fair hearing from english reader . 
now , in 1961 , the catholic population of england be still quite small ( ten percent , or 5 million ) ; yet it represent a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population . 
a protestant woman marvel to me over the large crowd go_in and go_out of the group ( catholic ) church on sunday morning . 
she find this a marvel because , as she say , only six percent of english_people be churchgoer . 
she may not have be exact on this number , but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less_than ten . 
from many side come remark that protestant church are badly attend and the large medieval cathedral look all_but empty during service . 
a catholic priest recently recount how in the chapel of a large city_university , following anglican evensong , at which there be a congregation of twelve , he celebrate mass before more_than a_hundred . 
the protestant themselves be the first to admit the great falling_off in effective membership in their church . 
according_to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistic of the church_of_england , the `` total of confirmed member be 9748000 , but only 2887671 are register on the parochial church_roll '' , and `` over 27 million person in england are baptize into the church_of_england , but roughly only a tenth of them continue '' . 
an amazing article in the manchester_guardian of last november , entitle `` fate of redundant church '' , state than an archbishop ' commission `` report last month that in the church_of_england alone there be 790 church which be redundant now , or will be in 20 year ' time . 
a further 260 anglican church have been demolish since 1948 '' . 
and in the last five year , the `` methodist chapel committee has authorize the demolition or , more often , the sale of 764 chapel '' . 
most of these former church are now use as warehouse , but `` neither anglican nor nonconformist object to sell church to roman_catholic '' , and have done so . 
while it must be say that these same protestant have build some new church during this period , and that religious population_shift have empty church , a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy be that fewer protestant are go_to church . 
it should be admit , too , that there be a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing catholic ( one paper write 50 percent ) . 
still , it be clear from such report , and apparently clear from the remark of many person , that protestant are decrease and catholic increase . 
an anglican clergyman in oxford sadly but frankly acknowledge to me that this be true . 
a century ago , person see that liberalism ( what we now might call secularism ) would gradually but definitely make its mark on group , and that even high_anglicanism would someday no_longer be a `` serviceable breakwater against doctrinal error more fundamental than its own '' . 
that day be perhaps today , 1961 , and it seem no_longer very meaningful to call england a `` protestant country '' . 
one of the irony of the present crusade for christian unity be that there be not , relatively speak , many real christian to unite . 
many english catholic be proud of their catholicism and know that they be in a new ascendancy . 
the london_universe devote its centenary issue last december 8 to map_out various aspect of catholic progress during the last one_hundred year . 
with traditional nationalistic spirit , some englishman claim that english catholicism be catholicism at its best . 
i have find myself say with other foreigner here that english catholic be good catholic . 
it has been my experience to find as many man as woman in church , and to hear almost everyone in church congregation recite the latin prayer and response at mass . 
they hope , of_course , to reclaim the non-catholic population to the catholic faith , and at every sunday benediction they recite by_heart the `` prayer_for_england '' : 
`` o blessed virgin_mary , mother of god and our most gentle queen and mother , look down in mercy upon england , thy '' dowry `` , and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee . 
intercede for our separated brother , that with us in the one true fold they may be unite to the chief shepherd , the vicar of thy son '' . 
a hymn often to be hear in catholic church be `` faith_of_our_fathers '' , which glory in england 's ancient faith that endure persecution , and which proclaim : 
`` faith of our father : virgin_mary 's prayer / shall win our country back to thee '' . 
the english saint are widely venerate , quite naturally , and now there be great hope that the person and person will soon be canonize . 
because they have keep the faith of their medieval father , english catholic have always strongly resent the charge of be `` english '' . 
i have not see this charge make during my stay here , but apparently it be still in_the_air . 
for_example , a writer in a recent number of the_queen hyperbolically state that `` of the myriad imprecation the only one which the english catholic really resent be the suggestion that they be ' un english '' ' . 
in this connection , it has been observe that the increasing number of irish catholic , priest and laity , in england , while certainly see as good for catholicism , be nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic english catholic , especially when these irishman offer to remind their christian brother of this good . 
one of the more noteworthy change that have take_place since the mid 19th century be the situation of catholic at group and group . 
at group one_hundred year ago there be very few catholic , partly because religious test were remove only in 1854 . 
moreover , for those few there be almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious need . 
now , not_only are there considerably more laity as student and professor at group , but there be also numerous house of religious_order exist in respectable and friendly relations with the non-catholic member of the university . 
some catholic priest lecture there ; catholic seminarian attend tutorial and row on the location with non-catholic student . 
further evidence that roman_catholicism enjoy a more favorable_position today than in 1861 be the respectful attention give to_it in the mass_media of england . 
the general tone of article appear in such important newspaper as the manchester_guardian and the sunday_observer imply a kindly recognition that the catholic_church be now at_least of equal stature in england with the protestant church . 
on successive sunday during october , 1960 , person ( a non-catholic ) write article in the group depict clergyman of the church_of_england , the group and the group . 
the catholic priest , though somewhat superficially draw , easily come_out the best . 
there be many letter of strong protest against the portrait of the anglican clergyman , who was indeed portray as a man not particularly concerned with religious matter and without really very_much to do as clergyman . 
such a series of article was certainly never print in the public_press of mid victorian england . 
there be so much interest show in this present-day venture that it was continue on group , where comment were equally make by an anglican parson , a group minister and a catholic priest . 
catholic priest have frequently appear on television_program , sometimes discuss the christian faith on an equal footing with protestant clergyman . 
a notable example of this be the discussion of christian unity by the catholic archbishop of liverpool , person , and the anglican archbishop of location , person , recently appointed archbishop of location . 
the good feeling which exist between these two important church figure be now well_known in england . 
the holy_sacrament of the mass with commentary has been televise several time in recent month . 
and it be interesting to observe that group . 's television film on christmas_eve be the_bells_of_st._mary's . 
of_course , the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern of english religious history be the friendly visit pay by person , then anglican archbishop of location , to the vatican last december . 
it be the first time an english primate has do this since the 14th century . 
english catholic react to this event with moderate but real hope . 
almost daily something is report which feed this catholic hope in england : statistic of the increasing number of convert and irish catholic immigrant ; news of a protestant minister in location who has offer to allow a catholic priest to preach from his pulpit ; a report that a catholic nun had been request to teach in a non-catholic secondary_school during the sickness of one of its master ; the startling statement in a respectable periodical that `` catholic , if the present system be still in_operation , will constitute almost one-third of the group in the next generation '' ; a report that 200 protestant clergyman and laity attend a votive mass offer for christian unity at a catholic_church in location during the church unity octave . 
the death of a man be unique , and yet it be universal . 
the straight_line would symbolize its uniqueness , the circle its universality . 
but how can one figure symbolize both ? 
christianity declare that in the life and death of jesus_christ the unique and the universal concur . 
perhaps no church_father see this concurrence of the unique and the universal as clearly , or formulate it as precisely , as person . 
to be the savior and the lord , jesus_christ has to be a historical individual with a biography all his own ; he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoop to earth for_a_while but never identify itself with man 's history . 
yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind . 
his history be his alone , yet each man must recognize his own history in it . 
his death be his alone , yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of jesus . 
each man can identify himself with the history and the death of jesus_christ because jesus_christ has identify himself with human history and human_death , come as the head of a new humanity . 
not a circle , then , nor a straight_line , but a spiral represent the shape of death as person see it ; for a spiral have motion as_well_as recurrence . 
as represent by a spiral , history may , in_some_sense , be say to repeat itself ; yet each historical event remain unique . 
christ be both unique and universal . 
the first turn of the spiral be the primeval history of humanity in adam . 
as person interpret the end of history on the basis of its beginning , so person portray the story of adam on the basis of the story of christ . 
`` whence , then , come the substance of the first man ? 
from god 's will and wisdom , and from virgin earth . 
for ' god had not rained ' , say the scripture , before man was make , ' and there be no man to till the earth ' . 
from this earth , then , while it be still virgin god take dust and fashion the man , the beginning of humanity '' . 
person does not regard adam and eve merely as private individual , but as universal human_being , who be and be all_of humanity . 
adam and eve be perfect , not in the sense that they possess perfection , but in the sense that they be capable of development toward perfection . 
they be , in_fact , child . 
person does not claim preexistence for the human soul ; therefore there be no need for him , as there be for person , to identify existence itself with the fall . 
existence is create and will by god and be not the consequence of a preexistent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity into history . 
historical existence be a create good . 
the biblical symbol for this affirmation is express in the word : `` so god create man in his own image ; in the similitude of god he create him '' . 
there be some passage in the writings of person where the image of god and the similitude are sharply distinguish , so most notably in the statement : `` if the [ holy_spirit ] spirit be absent from the soul , such a man be indeed of an animal nature ; and , being leave carnal , he will be an imperfect being , possess the image [ of god ] in his formation , but not receive the similitude [ of god ] through the holy_spirit '' . 
thus the image of god be that which make a man a man and not an oyster ; the similitude of god , by contrast , be that which make a man a child of god and not merely a rational creature . 
recent research on person , however , make it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction . 
he does not mean to say that adam lose the similitude of god and his immortality through the fall ; for he was create not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as_well_as of mortality . 
therefore person describe man 's creation as_follows : 
`` so_that the man should not have thought of grandeur , and become lift_up , as if he have no lord , because of the dominion that had been give to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against god his creator , overstep his bounds , and take_up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards god , a law was give him by god , that he might know that he have for lord the lord of all . 
and he lay_down for him certain condition : so_that , if he keep the command of god , then he would always remain as he be , that_is , immortal ; but if he did not , he would become mortal , melt into earth , whence his frame had been take '' . 
these condition man did not keep , and thus he become mortal ; yet he did not stop be human as a result . 
there be no justification for systematize the random statement of person about the image of god beyond this , nor for read into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of god ( humanity ) and the similitude of god ( immortality ) . 
man was create with the capacity for immortality , but the devil 's promise of immortality in exchange for disobedience cost adam his immortality . 
he was , in the words of person , `` beguile by another under the pretext of immortality '' . 
the true way to immortality lie through obedience , but man did not believe this . 
`` eve be disobedient ; for she did not obey when as_yet she be a virgin . 
and even as she , have indeed a husband , adam , but be nevertheless as_yet a virgin , having become disobedient , was make the cause of death , both to herself and to the entire human_race ; so also did mary , have a man betrothed [ to her ] , and be nevertheless a virgin , by yield obedience , become the cause of salvation , both to herself and the whole human_race '' . 
because he interpret the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believe that adam and eve were create as child , person often seem inclined to extenuate their disobedience as be `` due_to , no_doubt , to carelessness , but still wicked '' . 
his interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompt him to draw these parallel between the virgin eve and the virgin mary . 
that parallelism affect his picture of man 's disobedience too ; for as it be christ , the word_of_god , who come to rescue man , so it be disobedience to the word_of_god in_the_beginning that bring death into the world , and all our woe . 
with this act of disobedience , and not with the inception of his individual existence , man begin the downward circuit on the spiral of history , descend from the create capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality . 
at the nadir of that circuit be death . 
`` along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death , because they did eat in disobedience ; and disobedience to god entail death . 
wherefore , as they become forfeit to death , from that [ moment ] they were hand_over to it '' . 
this lead person to the somewhat startling notion that adam and eve die on the same day that they disobey , namely , on a friday , as a parallel to the death of christ on good_friday ; he see a parallel also to the jewish day of preparation for the sabbath . 
in_any_case , though they had been promise immortality if they eat of the tree , they obtain mortality instead . 
the wages of sin be death . 
man 's life , originally shape for immortality and for communion with god , must now be conform_to the shape of death . 
nevertheless , even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belong to god , and he still rule . 
even death , therefore , have a providential as_well_as a punitive function . 
`` wherefore also he [ god ] drive_out him [ man ] out of paradise , and remove him far from the tree of life , not because he envy him the tree of life , as some venture to assert , but because he pity him , [ and did not desire ] that he should continue a sinner for ever , nor that the sin which surround him should be immortal , and evil interminable and irremediable . 
but he set a bound to his [ state of ] sin , by interpose death , and thus cause sin to cease , putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh , which should take_place in the earth , so_that man , cease at_length to live in sin , and die to it , might live to god '' . 
this idea , which occur in both person and person , fit especially well into the scheme of person ' theology ; for it prepare the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieve in christ . 
as man can live only by die , so it be only by his die that christ could bring many to life . 
it be probably fair to say that the idea of death be more profound in person than the idea of sin be . 
this apply to his picture of adam . 
it is bear_out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin pass from one generation to the next . 
it become most evident in his description of christ as the second adam , who does indeed come to destroy sin , but whose work culminate in the achievement of immortality . 
this emphasis upon death rather than sin as man 's fundamental problem person share with many early theologian , especially the greek speak ones . 
they speak of the work of christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility , which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) deliverance from time and history . 
death remind man of his sin , but it remind him also of his transience . 
it represent a punishment that he know he deserve , but it also symbolize most dramatically that he live his life within the process of time . 
these two aspect of death cannot be successfully separate , but they dare not be confuse or identify . 
the repeated effort in christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspect of death cannot be separate . 
such effort almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether adam was create capable of grow old and_then old and_then still older , in_short , whether adam 's life was intend to be part of the process of time . 
if it was , then it must have be god 's intention to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity . 
one night , so some of these theory run , adam would have fall_asleep , much_as he fall_asleep for the creation of eve ; and thus he would have been carry_over into the life_eternal . 
the embarrassment of these theory over the naturalness of death be an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment , for some termination seem necessary in a life that is live within the natural_order of time and change . 
on_the_other_hand , christian faith know that death be more than the natural termination of temporal existence . 
it be the wages of sin , and its sting be the law . 
if this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguish from the idea of death as natural termination , the conclusion seem inevitable that temporal existence itself be a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the creator . 
this seem to have be the conclusion to which person was force . 
if death receive more_than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receive less_than its share , the gift of the life_eternal through christ begin to look_like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i.e. , created , existence . 
such an interpretation of death radically alter the christian view of creation ; for it teach salvation from , not salvation in , time and history . 
because christianity teach not_only salvation in history , but salvation by the history of christ , such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the christian understanding of the work of christ . 
too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly either because his parent do n't want sonny_boy to `` lift all those old barbell thing '' because `` you 'll stunt your growth '' or because childish taunt from his schoolmate , like `` hey , lookit person , whaddya gonna do with all those muscle ( of which he have none at the time ) '' ? 
after_all , a guy 's gotta have a_little ego ! 
therefore it 's a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in_secret ; has never hear one unkind word from his parent ; and never has been taunt by his schoolmate ! 
this happy , always smile lad with the sunny disposition be our new person - person . 
far from discourage person , his parent urge him on to great and great accomplishment . 
instead of admonish him to let the weight alone they personally take him to that master montreal bodybuilding authority , person . 
and they could n't have entrust person to better hands because `` le_professeur '' know his muscle from the sternocleido_mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis_anticus of the leg - and better still , he know just what exercise work best for them and what person principle to combine them with for fast , fast muscle growth . 
that 's because the good professor teach only person method at his famous group which be located at 1821 location in montreal . 
undoubtedly you have read the case_history of some of his prizewinning pupil ( every pupil have a physique title of some kind or other ) . 
there 's person who be our new person ; person , whose story appear here two issue ago ; person , who be with us last month ; person , who recently win the `` most muscular man '' subdivision award in the person event ; and a host of others . 
yesiree , the professor know his muscle ! 
now when person be just 12 he be only 4 ' 10 '' tall and weigh an astounding 72 pound , and his greatest desire was to pack_on some weight . 
about that time he begin read person and person and he learn of the famous person way to fast weight_gaining . 
see so many illustration and read so many testimonial to the value of quick-wate and super-protein , those two wonderworking person food supplement , he decide to try them and see what they could do for him . 
well , sir , they do real great ! 
for in almost less time than it take to tell it , person 's body weight was increase rapidly . 
of_course he do some exercising - he 's crazy about water-skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in_conjunction_with the added food supplement pack_on pound of solid muscle on his skinny frame . 
person has always have shapely leg from swim and water_ski and really does n't have to work them very_much . 
but he be totally dissatisfied with his upper body . 
it be muscular but it be n't symmetrical . 
`` a real ' nothing ' torso '' , say person . 
`` it never seem to widen , it just get long and long '' . 
that 's when he go_to person . 
and at_once person see what the trouble be and he know just how to correct it . 
in his gym the professor have some of the most `` knocked_out '' equipment since person . 
person be a specialist in torso development and he has long favor the now famous weider_push-pull_super-set technique in which one exercise of the super-set be a pressing or `` pushing '' movement which accent one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , follow by a `` pulling '' exercise which work the opposing sector of the same muscle group . 
so right_away person introduce person to his famous `` moon '' bench and proceed to teach him his first push-pull_super-set consist_of the wide grip straight-arm_pullover ( the `` pull '' part of the push-pull_super-set ) which dramatically widen the rib_cage and strongly affect the muscle of the upper back and chest , and the collar-to-collar bench_press which specifically work_on the chest to build those wide , person `` gladiator '' pecs , while stimulate the upper lat and frontal deltoid . 
as you can see , in this push-pull_super_set the entire chest back shoulder area is vigorously exercise in alternate sector by alternate exercise , so the complete torso remain pumped-up all_the_time ! 
now when person has complete four complete push-pull_super-sets no. 1 , the professor allow him about a five minute rest period before start him on four complete push-pull_super-sets no. 2 . 
super-set no. 2 is make_up of similar exercise , but this time done with dumbbell , and use both `` moon '' and flat_bench . 
the `` push '' exercise of this push-pull_super-set be the bench_press done with elbow well pulled back and with a great downward stretch of the pectoral not possible with the barbell variation . 
you need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs . 
the dumbbell variation develop a most classically sculpture outline to the pecs . 
the `` pull '' exercise in this super-set be the one dumbbell bent-arm_pullover . 
( note how strongly the upper lat and serratus are work in this fine exercise because of the pinpoint concentration of force which the dumbbell variation afford ) . 
in the third push-pull_super-set the `` push '' exercise be the wide grip pushup_between_bars , while the `` pull '' exercise be the moon_bench_lateral_raise with bent arm . 
the pushup done in this manner be the greatest pectoral rib_cage stretch ever invent ! 
this be true only if a very wide grip is use and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieve . 
you 'll know when you 've made the greatest stretch because your shoulder_blade will touch ! 
as you see , the professor has design a piece of apparatus that force the bodybuilder to use a wide grip . 
he has to ; he just can n't do anything about it at_all ! 
but as you can also see , it 's not a painful exercise at_all , because person - the `` happy '' bodybuilder - look as though he were have the time of his life ! 
the last exercise of person 's prescribed program for person be a single exercise , done in individual set with a_bit long pause between set . 
by this time person 's entire chest back - lat shoulder area be pumped-up to almost burst point , and person take time to do a_bit more pectoral front deltoid shaping work . 
he have person do from four to six set of the incline_bench_press ( note the high incline ) . 
this give a wide flare to the pecs , cause them to flow dramatically upward into deltoid and dramatically downward into the serratus and lat . 
this be the kind of chest that invariably win contest that steel edged `` carved out_of solid rock '' look of the great champion . 
so with four complete push-pull_super-sets no. 1 , four of no. 2 , four of no. 3 and four to six set of the incline_bench_press , you can see that person has have a terrific mass build , muscle shape , torso defining workout that cannot be improve upon . 
physique contest are rarely win on muscle size alone . 
rare still be a mr._america or mr._universe of true herculean build . 
the aspect of physical development that catch the judge ' eye and which rightfully influence their decision be symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion - superior definition of the muscle . 
now good definition be one thing that all_of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light weight workout . 
but contest definition - that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seem as though it must have been carve by a sculptor 's chisel - be something quite different . 
this come not alone from high-set , high-rep training , but from certain definition specialization exercise which the champion select for himself with the knowledge of exactly what work best for him . 
often these exercise work well for some bodybuilder but less spectacularly for others . 
because they be `` minority '' exercise and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten . 
only when the new mr._america or mr._universe rediscover them and put them into practice are we reacquaint with them and once_again see how effective they really be . 
the exercise i shall discuss in this - the first of a new series of article on muscle definition specialization of a particular body_part - be the one_leg_lunge . 
why it was ever forget for even a moment i cannot say because it work perfectly for everyone , no_matter whether he have short or long thighbone length ! 
it be the one exercise that drastically influence the definition of the thigh at the hipline - that mark of the champion that set him apart from all other bodybuilder - a criterion of muscle `` drama '' that_is unforgettable to judge and audience alike - the facet of muscular development that win prize . 
definition of the thigh at the uppermost part is quite commonly see in most championship olympic lifter which be easily understandable . 
the one_leg_lunge be a split and all lifter practice this in their regular workout . 
but for purely definition purpose - use in conjunction with your regular squatting , leg_curling , leg_extensor program - a heavy weight is not needed . 
indeed , a light weight work much better because a greater , more extensive split can be_performed . 
use in several set of high reps once or twice each_week it will not be long before your entire upper leg take_on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscle look_like wire cable writhe and twist under the skin ! 
really there be no reason why this fine exercise should not find_its_way into your leg program at all time , for the following suggestion show why it be so effective : 
it 's a complete thigh contraction extension exercise . 
it place terrific tension on the leg muscle from_start_to_finish of each repetition . 
it improve overall balance and control for the bodybuilder , and help to make squat more easily and more correctly perform . 
it increase flexibility of the leg . 
it speed muscle growth and power development even for the advanced bodybuilder because each hip and leg is exercise separately , thus enable a massive , concentrated effort to be focus_on each . 
you 'll need your weider_power_stands for this fine exercise and here 's the way it 's do : 
place your power_stands in position and adjust their height so_that this will correspond to the height of your shoulder when you be in a deep leg split as for a heavy clean . 
place a suitably loaded barbell across them ; grasp the bar ( which will rest against the back of your neck ) ; extend your foot forward and backward until you be in a deep leg split . 
now raise the weight by straighten your front leg , without move your foot . 
when the front knee be straight and lock , allow it to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the side of the power_stands . 
after you have take_a_breather , reverse the position of your leg so_that the front thigh of the previous exercise be now to the rear , and the rear thigh now to the front , and perform the same movement in the same manner . 
that 's the one-leg_lunge in_a_nutshell . 
you should have a_couple_of training partner to stand_by when you make your first experiment , just for safety . 
you should also begin this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed to it balance_wise . 
oh , you 'll wobble and weave quite a_bit at_first . 
but do n't worry . 
before your first training experiment has end there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it you 'll be raise and lower yourself just like a veteran ! 
although i suggest that you hold the bar at the back of the neck there 's no reason why you should n't make some experiment with the bar hold in_front_of the neck . 
squat_style lifter and leg split lifter would both benefit enormously by practice those variation providing that they remember to make alternate set with the left and right leg to the front . 
the most beautiful bed of pansy i 've see be in a south_dakota yard on a sizzling day . 
pansy be supposed to like it cool , but those great velvety flower be healthy and perky in the glaring sun . 
i seek_out the gardener and ask him what he do to produce such beauty in that weather . 
he seem puzzle by my question . 
`` i just love them '' , he say . 
the more i talk with him , the more convinced i become that that be the secret of their riotous blooming . 
of_course his love was express in intelligent care . 
he plant the pansy seed himself , buy them from a pansy specialist . 
these specialist , i learn , have do a great_deal of work to improve the size and health of the plant and the resulting flower . 
their seed produce vigorous blooming plant half again the size of the unimproved strain . 
i ask him if he take seed from his own plant . 
occasionally , when he have an unusual flower that he want more of he did ; but pansy seed , he tell me , soon `` run_down '' . 
it be best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is work to improve them . 
his soil be `` nothing special '' , just prairie land , but he had harrow in compost until it be loose , spongy and brown black . 
i finger it and have the feeling of adequacy that come_with the right texture , tilth and body . 
it be n't easy to describe it , but every gardener know it when his finger touch such soil . 
nothing be easy to grow from seed than pansy . 
they germinate quickly , the tiny plant appear in a week , and grow along lustily . 
it does n't really matter which month of the year you sow them , but they germinate best when they have a wide variation of temperature , very warm follow by cool in the same 24 hour . 
i like to make a seedbed right in the open , though many people start them successfully in cold_frame . 
pansy do n't have to be coddle ; they 'd rather have thing rugged , with only moderate protection on the cold day . 
if you do use a cold_frame be sure that its ventilation be adequate . 
for my seedbed i use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage rooting . 
i dig it , rake it smooth , sow the seed and wet them down with a fog spray . 
then i cover the sow with a board . 
this keep it cool and moist and protect it from bird . 
ant carry_away the seed so better be sure that there be no ant hill nearby . 
when the first sprinkling of green appear i remove the board . 
a light , porous mulch apply now keep the root cool and the soil soft during these early day of growth . 
i like sawdust for this , or hay . 
when they have 4 to 6 leaf and be thrifty little plant , it be time to set them out where they are to remain . 
every time you transplant a pansy you cause its flower to become smaller . 
the moral be : do n't transplant it any oftener than you must . 
as_soon_as they be large enough to move , i put mine 9 inch apart where they are to bloom . 
i put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed bonemeal into each hole with the plant . 
that encourage rooting , and the better developed the root , the large and more plentiful the flower . 
pansy be glutton . 
i doubt if it be possible to overfeed them . 
i spade lot of compost into their bed ; lack that , decayed manure spread_over the bed be fine . 
one year i simply set the plant in the remains of a compost pile , to which a_little sand had been add , and i have the most beautiful pansy in my , or any of my neighbor ' experience . 
in_addition to the rich soil they benefit by feeding of manure water every_other week , dilute to the color of weak tea . 
as a substitute for this , organic fertilizer dissolve in water to half the strength in the direction , may be use . 
they need mulch . 
we put a light mulch over the seedling ; now we must use a heavy one . 
three inch of porous material will do a good job of keep weed down and the soil moist and cool . 
when winter come be ready with additional mulch . 
i like hay for this and apply it so_that only the top of the plant show right after a good frost . 
that keep_in the cold , retain moisture and prevent the heave of alternate freezing and thawing . 
do n't miss the pansy that appear from_time_to_time through the winter . 
whenever there be a thaw or a_few sunny day , you 'll be likely to find a brave little blossom or two . 
if those be n't enough for you , why not grow some just for winter blooming ? 
the pansy i cherish most bloom for me in february during a particularly cold winter . 
i start the seed in a flat in june and set_out the little pansy in a cold_frame . 
( an unheated greenhouse would have be better , if i had have one . ) 
the plant take zero night in_stride their stride , with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass to protect them . 
in response to the lengthening day of february they bud , then bloom their 4 - inch velvety flower . 
that cold_frame be my morale_builder ; its mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow make my spirit rise every time i look at it . 
like strawberry in december , pansy be far more exciting in february than in may . 
try that late winter pickup when you be so tired_of cold and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it . 
the day will come , in midsummer , when you find your plant become `` leggy '' , run to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossom . 
try peg_down each separate branch to the earth , use a bobby_pin to hold it there . 
pick the flower , keep the soil dampen , and each of the pegged-down branch will take root and become a little plant and go_on bloom for the rest of the season . 
as_soon_as an experimental tug assure you that root have taken_over , cut_off it off from the mother plant . 
a second and also good practice be to shear off the top , leave an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each branch . 
these cut_down plant will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring . 
i like to shear half my plant at_a_time , leave one half of them to blossom while the second_half is get_started on its new round of blooming . 
probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom be to let the blossom go to seed . 
nature 's aim , different from ours , be to provide for the coming generation . 
that done , her work be accomplished and she ignore the plant . 
here be a word_of_advice when you go shopping for your pansy seed . 
go_to a reputable grower , preferably a pansy specialist . 
it be no hard to raise big , healthy , blooming plant than weak , sickly little thing ; in_fact it be easy . 
but you will never get better flower than the seed you grow . 
many people think that pansy last only a_few week , then their period of growth and bloom be over . 
that be not true . 
if the plant are care for and protect over the winter , the second year be more prolific than the first . 
would you like to grow exhibition pansy ? 
remove about half the branch from each plant , leave only the strong with the largest bud . 
the flower will be huge . 
pansy have character . 
they stick_to their principle , insist upon their due , but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if give it . 
treat them right and they 'll make a showing every_month in the year except the frigid ones . 
give them food , some shade , mulch , water and more food , and they 'll repay your solicitude with beauty . 
a salad with greens and tomato be a popular and wonderfully healthful addition to a meal , but add an avocado and you have something really special . 
this delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past thirty year because modern transportation method have make it possible to ship avocado anywhere in the united_states . 
it have a great many asset to recommend it and if you have n't make avocado a part of your diet yet , you really should . 
you will find that avocado be unlike any other fruit you have ever taste . 
it be roughly shape like a large pear , and when properly ripen , its dark green skin cover a meaty , melon like pulp that have about the consistency of a ripe bartlett_pear , but oily . 
the avocado should have a `` give '' to it , as you hold it , when it be ripe . 
the flavor be neither sweet , like a pear , nor tart like an orange ; it be subtle and rather bland , nut like . 
it be a flavor that might take a_little get used_to - not because it be unpleasant , but because the flavor be hard to define in the light of our experience with other fruit . 
sometimes it take several `` eating '' of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste that has make it such a favorite throughout the world . 
once you become an avocado fan , you will look_forward to the season each_year with eager anticipation . 
today , refrigerated carrier have make the shipping of avocado possible to any place in the world . 
the fruit is allow to mature on the tree , but it be still firm at this point . 
it is bring to packinghouse , clean and grade as to size and quality , and pack in protective excelsior . 
the fruit is then cool to 42 ` f , a temperature at which it lapse into a sort_of dormant state . 
this cooling does not change the avocado in any way , it just delay the natural softening of the fruit until a grove like temperature ( room_temperature ) is restore . 
this happen on the grocer 's shelf or in your kitchen . 
one of the most attractive thing about avocado be that they do not require process of any kind . 
there be no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed . 
if the temperature is control properly , the avocado will delay its ripening until need . 
and unlike other fruit , one cannot eat the skin of the avocado . 
it be thick , much like an eggplant 's skin , so that poison spray , if they are use , present no hazard to the consumer . 
good taste and versatility , plus safety from spray poison would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit , even if its nutritional value be limited . 
avocado , however , be very rich_in nutrient . 
their main asset be an abundance of unsaturated fatty_acid , so necessary for maintain the good_health of the circulatory_system . 
aside from this , the average portion contain some protein , an appreciable amount of vitamin and vitamin_c - about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement , and about a third of the official vitamin_e requirement . 
the b_vitamin are well represent , especially thiamin and riboflavin . 
calcium , phosphorus and iron be present in worthwhile amount , and eleven other mineral also have been find in vary trace amount . 
none of these value is destroy , not significantly alter by refrigeration storage . 
person , of the group , location , florida , and the location , set_out to discover if avocado , because of their high content of unsaturated fatty_acid , would reduce the cholesterol of the blood in select patient . 
the study comprise 16 male patient , range in age from 27 to 72 . 
they were put on control diet to determine as accurately as possible , the normal cholesterol level of their blood . 
then they were give 12 to 1 - 12 avocado per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption . 
the lyric beauty of person 's trout_quintet - its elemental rhythm and infectious melody - make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listener . 
but for student of musical form and would-be classifier , the work present its problem . 
since it require only five player , it would seem to fall_into the category of chamber_music - yet it call_for a double_bass , an instrument generally regard_as symphonic . 
moreover , the piece is write in five movement , rather_than the conventional four of most quintet , and this give the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor . 
the many and frequent performance of the trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing . 
some rendition be of symphonic dimension , with the contrabass give free_rein . 
other interpretation present the music as an essentially intimate creation . 
in these reading , the double_bass is either keep discreetly in the background , or it is dress in clown 's attire - the musical equivalent of a bull_in_a_china_shop . 
recently i was strike anew by the divergent approach , when in the course of one afternoon and evening i listen to no fewer than ten different performance . 
the occasion for this marathon : group 's long awaited reissue in its `` great_recordings_of_the_century '' series of the schnabel-pro_arte version . 
let me say at the outset that the music sound as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first . 
whether consider alone or in_relation_to other edition , colh 40 be a document of prime importance . 
person be one of the greatest person player of_all_time , and any commentary of his on this repertory be valuable . 
but person be a great teacher in_addition_to be a great performer , and the fact that four of the ten version i listen to be by person pupil ( person , person , person , and person ) also shed_light_on the master 's pedagogical skill . 
certain pianistic trait be common to all five person rendition , most notably the `` person trill '' ( which differ from the conventional trill in_that the two note are strike simultaneously ) . 
but the most impressive testimony to person 's distinction as a teacher is reflect by the individuality which mark each student 's approach as distinctly his own . 
person 's emphasis on structural clarity , his innate rhythmic vibrancy , and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one . 
yet no detail be too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here have humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity . 
this be a serious minded interpretation , but it be never straitlaced . 
and although person 's pianism bristle with excitement , it be meticulously faithful to person 's dynamic marking and phrase indication . 
the piano performance on this person be one that really demand a search for superlative . 
about the group 's contribution i be less happy . 
i , for one , rather regret that person did n't collaborate with the group , whose rugged , athletic playing be a good_deal close to this pianist 's interpretative outlook than the style of the belgian group . 
from a technical standpoint , the string playing be good , but the group people fail to enter into the spirit of thing here . 
the violinist , in particular , be very indulgent with swoop and slide , and his tone be pinched and edgy . 
the twenty-five year old recording offer rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instrument be good and the transfer be very quiet . 
there be a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` forellen '' movement , and i suspect that this be_due to imperfect splicing between side of the original sps . 
turn_to the more modern version , person 's ( london ) offer the most sophisticated keyboard work . 
every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully think_out , and of these i would especially cite the delicious landler touch the pianist bring to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is play with viennese musician ) , and the gossamer shade throughout . 
some of person 's playing strike me as finicky , however . 
why , for_example , does he favor two tempo , rather than one , for the third movement ? 
the assist musician from the group be somewhat lacking in expertise , but their contribution be rustic and appealing . 
( special compliment to the double_bass playing of person : 
his scrawny , tottering sound add a delightful hilarity to the performance . ) 
the glazer-fine_arts edition ( concert-disc ) be a model of lucidity and organization . 
it be , moreover , a perfectly integrated ensemble effort . 
but having live with the disc for some time now , i find the performance less exciting than either person 's or person 's ( whose superb performance with the group has still to be record ) and a good_deal less filled with humor than person 's . 
person 's work be very_much akin to person 's , but the sound on his decca disc be dated , and you will have a hard_time locate a copy of it . 
the group ( group ) and group ( group ) edition give us superlative string playing ( both in symphonic style ) cripple by unimaginative piano playing . 
( person has acquire some of person 's keyboard manner , but his playing be of limited insight . ) 
badura-skoda-vienna_konzerthaus ( group ) and group ( group ) be both warm-toned , pleasantly lyrical , but rather slack and tensionless . 
person , play with a group of musician from the group , give a sturdy reading , in much the same vein as that of the last_mentioned pianist . 
group has accord him beautiful sound , and this bargain-priced disc ( it sell for $ 2.98 ) be worthy of consideration . 
return once_again to the person reissue , i am beguile anew by the magnificence of this pianist 's musical penetration . 
here be truly a `` great recording of the century '' , and its greatness is by_no_means diminish by the fact that it be not quite perfect . 
this recording surely belong in everyone 's collection . 
must record always sound like record ? 
from the beginning of commercial recording , new disc purport to be indistinguishable from the real_thing have regularly been put in circulation . 
see in perspective , many_of these release have a genuine claim to be milestone . 
although lacking absolute verisimilitude , they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary material for re-creation of the original . 
on the basis of what they give us we can know how the young person sing , appreciate the distinctive quality of person under person 's baton , or sense the type of ensemble person create in his year with the group . 
since the concept of high_fidelity become important some dozen year ago , the claim of technical improvement have multiply tenfold . 
in many case the revolutionary production has offer no more than sensational effect : 
the first hearing be fascinating and the second disillusioning as the gap between sound and substance become clear . 
other innovation with better claim to musical interest survive rehearing to acquire in_time the status of classic . 
if we return to them today , we have no difficulty spot their weakness but we find them still pleasing . 
record sound like record because they provide a different sort of experience than live music . 
this difference is make_up of many factor . 
some of them be obvious , such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our response and behavior in different type of environment and social setting . 
( music often sound best to me when i can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat . ) 
from the technical standpoint , record differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color , texture , complexity , range , intensity , pulse , and pitch of the original . 
any alteration of one of these factor is distortion , although we generally use that word only for effect so pronounced that they can be state quantitatively on the basis of standard test . 
yet it is the accumulation of distortion , the fit together of fractional bit until the total reach the threshold of our awareness , that make record sound like record . 
the sound may be good ; but if you know the real_thing , you know that what you are hear be only a clever imitation . 
group 's new person second be a major effort to make a record that sound like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one . 
like the recent scheherazade from group ( high_fidelity , sept 1961 ) , it be successful because emphasis has been place on good musical and engineering practice rather_than on create sensational effect . 
because of this , only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineer ' triumph . 
the easy way to describe this release is to say that it reproduce an interesting and effective person performance with minimal alteration of its musical value . 
the engineering as_such never obtrude_upon your consciousness . 
the effect of the recording be very open and natural , with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance . 
this absence of peaky high and beefed-up bass not_only produce greater fidelity , but it eliminate listener fatigue . 
a contributing factor be the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintain . 
the orchestra be far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrape , valve click , and other noise incidental_to playing . 
yet you feel the orchestra be near at_hand , and the individual instrument have the same firm presence associate with listen from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall . 
group has achieve the ideal amount of reverberation . 
the music is always allow the living_space needed to attain its full sonority ; yet the hall never intrude as a quasi performer . 
the timbre remain that of the instrument unclouded by resonance . 
all_of this would be wasted , of_course , if the performance lack authority and musical distinction . 
for me it have more of both element than the majority of its competitor . 
person seem to have go_back directly back to the score , discount tradition , and has build his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly what person set_down on_paper . 
those accustomed to broad , more romantic statement of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one . 
without lose the distinctive undertow of brahmsian rhythm , the pacing be firm and the overall performance have a tightly_knit quality that make_for maximum cumulative effect . 
the presto ma_non_assai of the first trio of the scherzo is take literally and may shock you , as the real allegro_con_spirito of the finale be likely to bring you to your foot . 
in_the_end , however , the thing about this performance that is most striking be the way it sings . 
person obviously has conclude that it be the lyric element which must dominate in this score , and he manage at_times to create the effect of the whole orchestra burst into song . 
the engineering provide exactly the support needed for such a result . 
too many record seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment . 
the group technique invite you to listen to the depth of the orchestration . 
your ear take you into the ensemble , and you may well become aware of instrumental detail which previously be apparent only in the score . 
it is this sort of experience that make the concept of high_fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener . 
the first substantially complete stereo giselle ( and the only one of its scope since person 's four-sided lp edition of 1958 for group ) , this set be , i'm afraid , likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment . 
the already faded pastel charm of the naive music itself vanish entirely in person 's melodramatic contrast between ultra vehement brute power and chilly , if suave , sentimentality . 
and in its engineer ' frantic attempt to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting brilliance , the recording sound as though it had been `` doctor for super high_fidelity '' . 
the home listener is overpower , all_right , but the experience be a far from pleasant one . 
as with the penultimate giselle release ( person 's abridgment for group ) i find the clean , less razor edged monophonic version , for all its lack of big stage spaciousness , the more aurally tolerable - but this may be the result of process defect in my sd copy . 
most recreation work call_for a good_deal of pre planning . 
this be particularly true in site selection . 
you must know before you start what the need and objective of your organization be ; you must have a list of requirement on where , how many , and what type site are need . 
with such a program you can make constructive selection of the best site available . 
begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photo if possible . 
these are become more_and_more available through the work of county and other government agency . 
the new_edition of topographical map being make by the federal_government be excellent for orient yourself to the natural feature of the site . 
these be inexpensive and available from the group , washington 25 , location . 
in recent year many county and the group have take aerial photo which show feature in_detail and be very good for planning use . 
most county also have map available from the county engineer show road and other feature and from the assessor 's office show ownership of land . 
inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily use for recreation . 
this give you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate condition , the exposure to the sun and wind , the water interest , etcetera , which vary greatly with the season . 
it be usually helpful to make a sketch_map in the field , show the size and location of the feature of interest and to take photograph at the site . 
these be a great aid for planning use back at the office . 
for site planning work , it be best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry_through the study . 
however , there be also much to be gain by make use of the ability of the local people who be available and interest in recreation . 
county judge , commissioner , engineer , assessor , and_others who have live in the area for a long_time may have valuable knowledge regard the site or opinion to offer from their varied professional experience . 
a visit to the site by a group of several person can usually bring_out new idea or verify opinion most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area . 
how much study is require ? 
this , of_course , depend_on the character of the site itself , the previous experience of the investigator , and the number of factor needed to arrive_at a good decision . 
it be too easy for the inexperienced_person to make a quick judgment of a_few value of the area and base a decision on these alone . 
usually there be more factor to good site planning than first impression . 
a site may be a run-down slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance today but have excellent potential for the future with a_little development or water . 
the same be true of area which at_first look good because of a_few existing recreation feature but may actually be poor area to develop for general public use . 
in look_for the best site available that meet the requirement , you need information to compare the site with others . 
you need answer to four important question . 
what be the existing recreation feature ? 
how well can the site be develop ? 
how useful will it be to the public ? 
be this site available ? 
check the quantity and quality of all_of the recreation interest already existing at the site . 
naturally , a park site with scenic view , a good lake , tree , and sand_dune , will attract more people than a nearby area with only tree and dune . 
quality be vitally important . 
frontage on a body of clear , clean water will be vastly different from the same amount of frontage on polluted water . 
some recreation feature , such as scenic value and water interest , also have great overall value than other interest . 
one of the most desirable feature for a park be beautiful view or scenery . 
it may be distant view of a valley or the mountain or natural feature such as a small lake , colorful rock formation , or unusual tree . 
a site which overlook a harbor or river may offer interest in the activity of boating traffic . 
an area on the coast may have relaxing view of the surf roll in on a beach . 
a site may also be attractive just through the beauty of its tree and shrub . 
note extent of these interest and how available they will be for the public to enjoy . 
water interest be one of the most valuable factor you can find for a recreation site . 
most park planner look_to water frontage for basic park area . 
this follow naturally since frontage on an ocean , stream , or lake provide scenic value and opportunity for the very popular recreation activity of bathing , fishing , boating , and other water_sport . 
a body_of_water be usually the center of interest at park which attract the greatest picnic and camping use . 
it also cool the air in summer and nourish the tree and wildlife . 
the amount of water frontage , the quantity and quality of the water , and the recreation afford by it be important . 
a restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use . 
the quantity of water flow may be critical ; a stream or pond which be attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer . 
if the site be on a reservoir , the level of the water at various season as it affect recreation should be study . 
check the quality of the water . 
a stream which have all_of its watershed within a national forest or other land under good conservation practice be less likely to be affect by pollution than one pass_through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area . 
other factor , such as water temperature , depth of water , the fish life it support , wave action , flood , etcetera , will affect its recreation value . 
other natural feature which can be of high interest be the forest , canyon , mountain , desert , seacoast , beach , sand_dune , waterfall , spring , etcetera with which the area is bless . 
just_as the national and state park place emphasis on feature which be of national or state significance , county should seek_out these feature which be distinctive of their area . 
although the site may not contain the feature themselves , there be often opportunity to include them as additional interest to the site . 
the route to the park may lead people past them or display view of them . 
a group of native tree or plant which be outstanding in a particular county can be feature at the site . 
the fish , animal , and bird which may be find at the site be another interest . 
fishing interest call_for a check of the species find , quantity and size , the season they be available , and the stocking program of the fish commission . 
animal may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby area . 
the site may be on one of the major flyway of migratory bird or have its own resident bird life . 
clam , crab , and other marine life may add interest at coastal area . 
each area have its own historical interest with which much can be do . 
park visitor be always eager to learn more about the area they be in . 
the historical sign tell its story , but nothing get_across interest across as well as some of the original historical item or place themselves which still have the character of the period cover . 
take_notice should be taken_of unusual rock formation , deposit , or shape of the earth 's crust in your region . 
those which tell a story of the earth 's formation in each area can add geological interest to the recreation site . 
an old shipwreck , a high dam , an old covered bridge , a place to find agate or other semiprecious stone or a place to pan gold , etcetera may be of interest . 
some area may provide archeological value such as ancient indian village site or hunting area , cave , artifact , etcetera . 
how well can the site be develop ? 
look at the physical feature of the land to determine how desirable it be for use , what can be do to correct the fault , and what it will cost to make the area meet your need in_comparison_to other site . 
many thing need to be check . 
the size of the area alone can be a determining_factor . 
an area may be too small for the need of the project . 
area should be large enough to include the attraction , have ample space for the use of facility needed , and have room around the edge to protect the value of the area from encroachment by private development . 
acreage in_excess_of the minimum be good practice as recreation area be never too large for the future and it be often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones . 
shape of the area is also related_to the use attraction and need of the development . 
a large picnic_area or camping development be most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred foot in_width in_preference_to a long narrow area less_than one_hundred foot wide . 
this be true because of saving in utility line and the fact that your building have a useful radius equal in all direction . 
however , a narrow strip may be very practical for small development , or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman 's trail , or include scenic strip within the park unit . 
the value of the site may be affect by the appearance of the adjoining land , ownership and use of the land , and the utility available there . 
for_instance , a site adjoining other publicly own land , such as a national forest or a public road , may be desirable , whereas a site next to an industrial plant might_not . 
the utility available nearby may provide a saving in the cost of extend electricity or water to the site . 
- topography be very important . 
check the elevation of the ground , degree and direction of slope , drainage , rock_outcrop , topsoil type and quality , as_well_as subsoil . 
nearly level area are require for parking_area , beach , camp area , ball_field , etcetera . 
determine how much topography limit useful area or what the cost of earth move or grading might be . 
- in_addition_to its recreation interest , water is need for drinking , sanitation , and irrigation . 
the quantity and quality of water source be often a big factor in site selection . 
the area may provide good spring or opportunity for a well or be near to municipal water_line . 
figure the cost of provide water to the use area . 
- the existing plant growth call_for thorough check . 
look at the tree as to size and interest , the amount of shade they provide , how healthy they be , the problem of maintenance , fire hazard , wind throw , etcetera . 
an area may have been partially log and require removal of stump or clean_up . 
some shrub may be of good landscaping value , other area of brush may need to be clear . 
the extent and location of open area is note . 
- how much will wind , rain , sun , and temperature affect the use ? 
an area sheltered from strong wind may be highly desirable for recreation use . 
the direction , velocity , and season of these wind should be note as to just how they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation of the area . 
lack of rainfall and extreme temperature may call_for the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable . 
sometimes , you have a choice of exposure for site where the topography or tree of the area will provide afternoon shade , morning sun , or whatever may be most_desirable for the use intended . 
- some area may already have been improve and contain building , road , utility , clear land , etcetera which may raise the cost of the site . 
the russian gymnast beat_the_tar_out_of the american gymnast in the 1960 olympics for one reason - they be better . 
they be better trained , better-looking , better built , better disciplined - and something else - they be better dancer . 
our athlete are only just begin to learn that they must study dance . 
the russian are all train as dancer before they start to study gymnastics . 
but why gymnastics at_all ? 
and be the sport really important ? 
after_all , we do pretty well in some other area of the olympics competition . 
but if it be important , what can we do to improve ourselves ? 
it be more than just lack of dance training that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance have some very important thing to learn from gymnastics . 
take first thing first , let 's understand the sport called gymnastics . 
it is make_up of tumbling , which might be say to start with a somersault , run_through such stunt as headstand , handstand , cartwheel , backbend , and culminate in nearly impossible combination of aerial flip and twist and apparatus work . 
the apparatus use by gymnast be once a common sight in american gym , but about 1930 it was in_favor_of game . 
the parallel_bars , horse , buck , springboard , horizontal_bar , ring , and mat formerly in the school gym were replace by baseball , volleyball , basketball and football . 
but the russian use gymnastics as the first_step in train for all other sport because it provide training in every basic quality except one , endurance . 
the gymnast must develop strength , flexibility , coordination , timing , rhythm , courage , discipline , persistence and the desire for perfection . 
in short , gymnastics use every part of the body and require a great_deal of character as_well . 
the addition of endurance training later , when the body be mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury , provide that final quality that make the top athlete , soldier or citizen . 
another reason gymnastic study be valuable be that it can be start very early in life . 
( an enterprising teacher or parent could start train a healthy child at the age of seven day . 
most european have been exercise newborn infant for century . ) 
in most sport , as in most walk_of_life , the angel be on the side of those who begin young , and the russian competitor of 16 have at_least thirteen year of training behind him . 
the american be very lucky if he have three . 
if a nation wish to get a head_start in physical fitness over all other nation , it would start its kindergarten student on a program of gymnastics the day they enter and thus eliminate a large_number of the problem that plague american school . 
first of the problem attack would be fatigue and emotional tension , since action relieve both . 
oddly_enough , it is prove that there would be less reading difficulty . 
certainly there would be less anxiety , fewer accident ( it be the clumsy child who sustain the worst injury ) , and high scholastic average , since alert child work better . 
russia know this , and that is why there be over 800000 compete for place as candidate for the olympic gymnastic team . 
eighty thousand win top honor and a chance to try_for the team itself . 
we could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people . 
and what have dancing to do with all this ? 
a great_deal . 
russia 's young gymnast have study dance before have the rigorous training on apparatus . 
well stretched , train in posture and coordinated movement , and wed to rhythm , they present the audience in rome with one of the most beautiful sight ever see at any olympic contest . 
american audience in particular learn two valuable lesson . 
they see completely masculine and obviously virile man perform with incredible grace . 
they were further strip of old_wives'_tale by see the slender , lovely russian girl perform feat require tremendous strength - and with not one bulging muscle . 
person has ask that we become a physically fit nation . 
if we wait until child be in junior_high or high_school , we will never manage it . 
to be fit , one has_to start early with young child , and today the only person who really reach such child be the teacher of dance . 
if the dance teacher of america make it their business to prepare their young charge for the gymnastics that must come someday if our school be really responsible , we will be that_much ahead . 
school_teacher , all_too unprepared for the job they must do , will need demonstrator . 
there should be youngster who know how to do a headstand , and also how to help other child learn it . 
they should know simple exercise that could prepare less fortunate child for the sport we will demand be teach . 
dance teacher can respond to person 's request not_only through their regular dance work , but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that make_for strength and flexibility . 
very little in today 's living provide the strength we need , and nothing provide the flexibility . 
dancer do have flexibility . 
they often fail , however , to develop real abdominal , back , chest , shoulder and arm strength . 
ask any group of ballerina to do ten pushup or three chin-up and the result , considering the amount of physical training they have have , will be very disappointing . 
even the boy will not be outstanding in these area . 
this be n't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11 - year old boy in america cannot chin themselves once , and that english schoolgirl outdo them in almost every test ( even dash and endurance ) . 
the only area in which american boy hold their own be the baseball throw . 
for arm and shoulder strength a chinning_bar is recommend . 
it should be install over a door that is in_full_view of everyone , and a chair should be place under it , a_little to one side . 
those child who can chin themselves should be tell to do one chin-up each time they pass under it . 
those who be too weak , should climb_on the chair and , start at the top of the chin , let_down themselves slowly down . 
when they can take ten second to accomplish the descent , they will have the strength to chin_up . 
parent should be inform about this system and encourage to do the same with the whole family at home . 
arm , shoulder , chest , upper and low back strength will be aid with the horse_kick . 
start on hand and foot . 
keep the hand in the starting position , run in_place to a quick rhythm . 
after this has become easy , use slow and slow rhythm , kick high and high . 
follow this by cross from one corner of the room to the other on_all_fours , kick as high as possible . 
pushup be essential , but few have the strength for them at_first . 
start on the knee in a large circle . 
fall slowly forward onto the hand and let_down the body down to rest_on the floor . 
push back up and repeat . 
do this exercise six time each class period . 
as strength improve start in a standing position with leg wide apart and upper body bend forward . 
start by fall forward to a point close to the foot , and , as strength improve , fall far and far out . 
try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate push from the hand . 
the pushup itself can be teach by start at the top of the pushup with leg spread wide . 
let_down the body down slowly , take at_least five second for the letting_down . 
five of these do daily for about a week will develop the strength for one pushup . 
handstand come after arm , chest and shoulder have develop at_least a minimum of strength . 
of_course those who have develop more will find them easy . 
start with the class stand in a circle , with weight on the right foot and the left extend a_little way into the circle . 
at_first each child should do a kick_up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone , and those who need help . 
drop both hand to the floor and at_the_same_time kick the right foot up in back . 
the left will follow at_once . 
the right will land first , follow by the left . 
return to the standing position . 
take_care should be taken to see that the hand are place on the floor before the kick start and also that the land foot is bring as close to the hand as possible . 
this will prevent flat fall and toe injury . 
bare foot be better for such work than any form of slipper . 
eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough so_that the teacher can catch the leading leg . 
the child should then bring both leg together overhead , point the toe and tighten the seat muscle . 
be sure that the land foot is bring close to the hand and that only one foot land at_a_time . 
the backbend be of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics , and , as with all acrobatics , the soon begin the better the result . 
have the class lie supine with knee apart and bent . 
place flat palm on either side of the head a_few inch away from the ear , finger point toward the shoulder . 
arch the back upwards to make a bridge . 
be sure the head drop backward so_that the child look at the floor rather_than toward the ceiling . 
as flexibility improve , the foot will move close to the hand and the bridge rise high . 
later this can be combine with the handstand to provide a walkover . 
to further increase back flexibility , work_on the back_circle . 
have the class lie prone . 
place the hand in_front_of the chest . 
keep the leg straight and the toe pointed . 
straighten the arm slowly , this arch the back . 
at the peak of the arch , tip the head back and bend the knee in an effort to touch toe to head . 
improvement can be measure by the lessening distance between toe and head . 
the last essential to the beginner 's gymnastic program be the somersault , or forward roll . 
this used_to be part of every child 's bag_of_tricks , but few child can do it today ; some be actually incapable of roll forward and be completely confused when not sit or stand upright . 
for most small child , learn a forward roll be simply a matter of copy another child who can . 
after it has been see , have the child start on a mat on hand and knee ( a thin , inexpensive mat be quite sufficient for anything that does not require fall ) . 
he place the hand on either side of the head , keep the chin down on the chest . 
he then push his seat into the air and the teacher guide it over . 
one or two practice run should be sufficient for solo . 
if , however , the child be weak , overweight , or afraid , more help will be need . 
when the child raise his seat into the air , the teacher take_hold under both side of the pelvis ; then no_matter_what_happens , the child 's performance will be control . 
by lift the seat upwards a_little , the weight is take_off the neck and the back is keep rounded . 
these be beginning , but correctly learn they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunt that can be perform by a strong , flexible body ( we are not talk of eccentric extreme ) . 
even if gymnastics be not the ultimate goal , the good tumbler will be a better dancer , a better athlete , and a human_being with a great margin of safety in any activity . 
it be very important for parent to understand that early training be imperative . 
and dancing_school , so helpful in artistic and psychological development , also contribute to this essential early training - and can contribute even more . 
the controversy of the last few year over whether architect or interior_designer should plan the interior of modern building has bring clearly into focus one important difference_of_opinion . 
the architect do not believe that the education of the interior_designer be sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior_designer be incapable of understand the architectural principle involved in plan the interior of a building . 
ordinary politeness may have militate against this opinion being state so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both group and who has sit through the many round_table , workshop or panel_discussion - whatever they be called - on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled-down crux_of_the_matter be education . 
it is true that most architectural school have five year course , some even have six or more . 
the element of public danger which enter so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure . 
this would , naturally , lengthen their course far beyond the largely esthetic demand of interior_designer 's training . 
we may then dismiss the time difference between these course and the usual four year course of the interior_design student as not have serious bearing on the subject . 
the real question that follow be - how are those four year use and what be their value as training ? 
the group has publish a recommended course for designer and a percentage layout of such a course . 
an examination of some forty catalog of school offer course in interior_design , for_the_most_part school accredit by membership in the group , and a further `` on_the_spot '' inspection of a number of school , show their course adhere pretty closely to the recommendation . 
one or two of the school have a five year curriculum , but the usual pattern of american education has limit most of them to the four year plan which seem to be the minimum in acceptable institution . 
the suggested course of the group was base on the usual course offer and on the opinion of many educator as to curricular necessity . 
obviously , the four year provision limit this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminate . 
without compare the relative merit of the two course - architecture versus interior_design - let us examine the educational need of the interior_designer . 
to_begin_with , what be an interior_designer ? 
`` the_dictionary_of_occupational_titles '' publish by the u.s. department_of_labor describe him as_follows : 
`` design , plan and furnish interior of house , commercial and institutional structure , hotel , club , ship , theater , as_well_as set_decoration for motion_picture arts and television . 
make drawing and plan of room show placement of furniture , floor_covering , wall decoration , and determine color_scheme . 
furnish complete cost estimate for client approval . 
make necessary purchase , place contracts , supervise construction , installation , finishing and placement of furniture , fixture and other correlated furnishings , and follow_through to completion of project `` . 
in_addition to this the u.s. group , when examine applicant for government position as interior_designer , expect that `` when various needed object be not obtainable on the market he will design them . 
he must be capable of design for and supervise the manufacture of any craft material need in the furnishings '' . 
this seem like a large_order . 
the interior_designer , then , must first be an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance . 
yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any reputable interior_designer does know all this and does practice it . 
and further he must understand his obligation to the client to not_only meet his physical necessity but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society . 
few will quarrel with the aim of the school or with the wording of their curriculum . 
it is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise . 
the old established independent art_school try their best to fulfill their obligation . 
yet even here many_a problem is present ; as in a recent design competition with a floor_plan and the simple command - `` design a luxury apartment '' ; no description of the client or his cultural level , no assertion of geographical_area or local social necessity - simply `` a luxury apartment '' . 
work in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in showpiece that look good in exhibition and catalog and may please the public_relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior_design . 
it is possible , of_course , to work_on extant or projected building where either architect or owner will explain their necessity so_that the student may get `` the feel '' of real interior_design demand . 
unfortunately , the purely synthetic problem be the rule . 
it be like medical_school in location where , in that fairyland of religious inhibition , the dissection of dead_body is frown_upon . 
instead they learn their dissection on the bulb of plant . 
thus technical efficiency is achieve at the expense of actual experience . 
in the early year of training certain phase of the work must be cover and the synthetic problem have its use . 
but to continue to divorce advanced student from reality be inexcusable . 
consultation with architect , client , real_estate man , fabric house and furniture company be essential to the proper development of class problem just as in actual work . 
fortunately , although only a_few year ago they hold the student at_arm's_length , today the business house welcome the opportunity to aid the student , not_only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today be the interior_designer of tomorrow - that the student already be `` in the trade '' . 
even the `` history of furniture '' can hardly be teach exclusively from photograph and lantern_slide . 
here , too , the reality of actual furniture must be experience . 
the professional organization such_as group , group , group and various trade association , can and do aid greatly in this work . 
certainly every educator involve in interior_design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organization . 
not_only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expect to be a member of one of the professional organization , but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinize that membership would be equivalent_to certification to teach the subject . 
participation for the educator in this case , however , would have_to be raise to full and complete membership . 
the largest of these organization at_present deny to the full-time educator any vote on the conduct and standard of the group and , indeed , refuse him even the right to attach the customary initial after his name in the college catalog . 
this anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the student . 
the professor in_turn dares not tolerate the influence in his class of an organization in the policy and standard of which he have no voice . 
this seem somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualification for membership which the organization profess are ever enforce , the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands . 
in one way the institute and society do a disservice to the school . 
that_is in the continuance of the `` grandfather_clause '' in their membership requirement . 
when these group were first form many prominent and accomplished decorator could not have have the advantage of school training since interior_design course be rare and undeveloped during their youth . 
long hard year of `` on_the_job '' training had bring them to their competence . 
the necessity of that day has long disappear . 
there be plenty of opportunity for proper education today . 
it be discouraging for student to realize that the society do not truly uphold the standard for which they be supposed to stand_for . 
the reason and the day of `` grandfather_clause '' has long_since pass . 
no one can deny that these `` back_door '' admission to membership provision have been seriously abuse nor that they have not result in the admission of downright incompetent to membership in supposedly learned society . 
beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teacher themselves . 
it will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education , a depth and breadth of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessity of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his student . 
the local decorator who rush in for a_few hour of teaching may but more likely may_not have these qualification . 
nor will the hack , the jack_of_all_trades , still find in some of the smaller art_school , suffice . 
only a_few year ago a midwestern college circulate a request for a teacher of interior_design . 
at the end of its letter be the information that applicant for this position `` must also be prepare to teach costume design and advertising art '' . 
this kind of irresponsibility toward their student can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer . 
we must build a corps of highly professional teacher of interior_design who have have education , experience in the profession and be willing to take_on the usual accompaniment of teaching - minimal income and minimal status among their confrere . 
considerable specialization in teaching subject such_as architecture , furniture design , textile and color be also desirable . 
in all `` degree '' course in interior_design a number of `` academic '' or `` general study '' course are include . 
it be only fair to demand that teacher of course in english , history , psychology and_so_on be as well informed in matter of art , especially interior_design , as be the art_teacher educated in the academic subject . 
the proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieve only_if this standard is observe . 
the matter of sympathy of the academic professor for art objective also must be take_into_account . 
one technical question of school organization come_to_mind here . 
for proper accreditation of school , teacher in any course must have a degree at_least one level above that for which the student be a candidate . 
since there be almost no school in the country offer graduate work in interior_design this rule cannot at_present be observe . 
indeed , it has only be a matter of the last few year that reputable school of art have grant degree at_all . 
the question , however , cannot be ignore for long . 
the basic problem involve be that a college set_up a graduate_school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree . 
most professor in the course must , naturally , again have a high degree than the course offer . 
one solution be the acquisition of degree in education but it be a poor substitute . 
it be a sort_of academic ring-around-a-rosy and you solve it . 
this bring us to the question of accreditation of art_school in_general . 
only the independent art_school , that_is , those not connected with any university or college , receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organization . 
it has be the custom for most university to stretch_the_blanket of accreditation for their liberal_arts school to cover_the_shivering_body of their fine_arts department . 
this , plus the habit of many school of simply add interior_design to the many subject of their home_economics department , yet , nevertheless , claim that they teach interior_design , has contribute to the low repute of many university course in interior_design . 
in_spite_of this , many university offer adequate and even distinguished course in the subject . 
there will be no mitigation of these offence until all art_school , whether independent or attached to university have separate accreditation - as do medical_school - by an art accreditation group such_as the `` group '' . 
independent art_school grant degree must , naturally , follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate regional group . 
there be a pause in the merriment as your friend gaze at you , wonder why you are stare , openmouthed in amazement . 
you explain , `` i have the strange feeling of having live through this very same event before . 
i can n't tell when , but i'm positive i witness this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past '' ! 
this experience will have happen to many of you . 
person , in his lecture , refer to the `` startling experience which almost every person confess in daylight , that particular passage of conversation and action have occur to him in the same order before , whether dream or wake , a suspicion that they have be with precisely these person in precisely this room , and hear precisely this dialogue , at some former hour , they know not when '' . 
most psychiatrist dismiss these instance of that weird feeling as the deja_vu ( already see ) illusion , just as they dismiss dream prevision as coincidence . 
in this manner they sidestep the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depth of mystery in which all_of us grope continually . 
when a man recognize a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream , we have an instance of deja_vu , except for the fact that he know just why the experience seem familiar . 
occasionally there be example of prevision which cannot be push_aside without confess an unscientific attitude . 
one day person , come_upon with a friend upon an event which he recognize as the exact pattern of a previous dream , detail the ensuing occurrence in_advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystify . 
person 's scorn for the `` jargon '' of psychical research was alter somewhat when he wonder `` how , or why , had i been show an unreleased roll of my life film '' ? 
the famous author tell us of the strange incident in something_about_myself . 
one day when he attend a war memorial ceremony in group his view was obstruct by a stout man on his left , his attention turn to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasp him by the arm , whisper , `` i want a word with you , please '' . 
at that moment person was overwhelm with awed amazement , suddenly recall that these identical details of scene , action and word had occur to him in a dream six week earlier . 
person probably contribute more_than anyone else to the understanding of dream , enable us to recognize their equivalent in our wakeful thought . 
however , reader who accept person 's finding and believe that he has solve completely the mystery of dream , should ponder over the following words in his interpretation_of_dreams , chapter 1 , : `` as_a_matter_of_fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplish in_any_case , and what_is_more , every one attempt such solution has find that in most case there have remain a great many component of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain , nor is the discussion close on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dream '' . 
dream present many mystery of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision . 
the basic mystery of dream , which embrace all the others and challenge us from even the most common typical dream , be in the fact that they be original , visual continuity . 
i recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which i live through the horror of the bombing of a little korean town . 
i be sure that nothing within me be capable of compose that lifelike sequence , so complete in_detail , from the hodgepodge of news picture i have see . 
and when psychology explain glibly , `` but the subconscious_mind be able to produce it '' it refer to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind . 
skeptic may deny the more startling phenomenon of dream as thing they have never personally observe , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery be outright avoidance of routine evidence . 
the question become , `` what be a dream '' ? 
be a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie ? 
every dream , and this be true of a mental_image of any type even though it may be readily interpret into its equivalent of wakeful thought , be a psychic_phenomenon for which no explanation be available . 
in most case we recognize certain words , person , animal or object . 
but these are dream in original action , in some particular continuity which we do n't remember having see in real_life . 
for_instance , the dreamer see himself seat behind neighbor person and , with photographic realism , see person drive the car ; whereas , it is a matter of fact that person cannot drive a car . 
there be nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impression to fit into an original , realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dream . 
the entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental_image can find no logical support . 
a `` mental_image '' subconsciously impress us from beneath its language symbol in wakeful thought , or consciously in light sleep , be actually not an image at_all but is comprise of reality , view not in the concurrent sensory stream , but within the depth of the fourth_dimension . 
dream that display event of the future with photographic detail call_for a theory explain their basic mystery and all its component , include that weird feeling of deja_vu , inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem . 
as in the theory of perception , establish in psychophysiology , the eye is recognize as an integral part of the brain . 
but then this theory confess that it be completely at_a_loss as to how the image can possibly be receive by the brain . 
the opening paragraph of the chapter title the_theory_of_representative_perception , in the book philosophies_of_science by person say , `` pass_on to the brain , and there , by some unexplained process , it cause the mind to have a perception '' . 
but why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? 
as retinal image are concede to be an integral function of the brain it seem logical to suppose that the nerve , between the inner brain and the eye , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain center - rather_than to theorize on the transmission of an image which be already in required location . 
hereby , the external object view by the eye remain the thing that is see , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stir sympathetic impulse in the other sensory center , motor tension , associated word symbol , and consciousness . 
modern physics has develop the theory that all matter consist_of minute wave of energy . 
we know that the number of radio and television impulse , sound_wave , ultraviolet ray , etc. , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , be infinite . 
so we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal , apparently momentary state_of_matter , successive one_after_another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequency . 
this theory make it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness . 
space in any form is completely measure by the three dimension . 
if the fourth_dimension be a physical concept and not purely metaphysical , through what medium does it extend ? 
it is not through space nor time that the time_machine most approve by science_fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past , or the ever existent past fantasy future . 
three second flat be the usual time , and the space is cross by moderate mileage , while the overwhelming immensity of such journey must be conceive as a static pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequency which perpetuate all event . 
the body , sense and brain , in_common_with all matter , have their counterpart on each of a countless number of frequency . 
the sense in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomenon that share its own frequency , whereas those upon all other frequency be invisible , inaudible and intactible to them . 
consciousness be the factor that provide the progressive continuity to sensory impression . 
when consciousness desert the sleeping body and the wakeful world , it continue in the myriad progression of the ever-present past and future , in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tire and require sleep . 
if the photographically realistic continuity of dream , however bizarre their combination , deny that it be purely a composition of the brain , it must be compound from view of diverse reality , although some of them may never be encounter in what we are please to call the real_life . 
person , professor of assyrian at the group , dream that a babylonian priest , associated with the king person , ( 1300 bc . ) escort him to the treasure chamber of the temple of location , give him six novel point of information about a certain broken relic , and correct an error in its identification . 
as_a_matter_of_fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many week of labor by person , was about to be publish by him the following day . 
some time later the missing part of the relic was find and the complete inscription , together with other new evidence , fully corroborate the ancient priest 's information . 
person be uncertain as to the language use by the ancient priest in his dream . 
he be almost positive it be not assyrian nor cassite , and imagine it must have been german or english . 
we may conclude that all six point of information , ostensibly give by the dream priest , could have been furnish by person 's subconscious reasoning . 
but , in deny any physical reality for this dream , how could the brain possibly compose that realistic , vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout , violent break or sudden substitution ? 
which theory be more fantastic : 1 . 
that the perfect continuity was compose from the job_lot of memory impression in the professor 's brain , or 2 . 
that the dream be a reality on the infinite progression of universal , gradient frequency , across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient location meet ? 
the degree of circumstance , the ratio of memory to forgetfulness , determine whether a dream will be a recognized , fulfill prevision , or the vaguely , effective source of the weird deja_vu feeling . 
no_doubt some experience vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the sleeper 's mind . 
probably less_than one_percent of our prevision escape final obliteration before we wake . 
when we arrive_at the event concern in the vanished majority , they , of_course , cannot impress us as anything familiar . 
nevertheless , there be notably frequent instance of deja_vu , in which our recognition of an entirely novel event be a feeling of having live through it before , a feeling which , though vague , withstand the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologist . 
if deja_vu be an illusion , then peculiarly , it be a most prevalent mental_disturbance affect even the most levelheaded people . 
person , onetime runner-up for the republican presidential nomination , was attend a convention at location , where he was schedule to nominate person for governor of new_york when he notice that the temporary chairman be a man he had never meet . 
after the preliminary business affair was finish person arise and deliver the convincing speech that clinch the nomination for person . 
if person had tell any academic psychologist that he have a weird feeling of having live through that identical convention session at some time in the past , he would have been inform that he be a victim of deja_vu . 
but the famous orator feel more than vague recognition for the scene . 
he remember exactly when he had live through it before , and he had something to prove he have . 
one week before the convention , person was seated on the porch of a country home on the hudson , gaze at the opposite shore . 
person prove a man of prompt action when person , accompany by a friend , visit him in location , california , several month ago as a prospective patient . 
`` doctor '' person ask her to lie_down on a bed and remove her shoe . 
then , by squeeze her foot three time , he come_up - presto - with a different diagnosis with each squeeze . 
she have - he inform her - kidney trouble , liver trouble , and a severe female disorder . 
( he explain that he could diagnose these ailment from squeeze her foot because all_of the nervous_system be connected to it . ) 
he know just the thing for her - a treatment from his `` cosmic light ozone generator '' machine . 
as he apply the applicator extend from the machine - which consist_of seven differently colored neon_tube superimpose on a rectangular base - to the supposedly diseased portion of person 's body , person keep_up a steady stream of pseudo scientific mumbo_jumbo . 
yes , the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything , he assure her . 
did she know , he ask , why the color of the tube be important to people 's health ? 
the human_body - he point_out , for_example - require 33 unit of blue light . 
for that reason , he inform her , the lord make the sky blue . 
continue glibly in this vein , he pause to comfort her : 
`` do n't you worry . 
this machine will cure your cancer ridden body '' . 
`` cancer '' ! 
person practically shriek . 
`` you did n't tell me i have cancer '' . 
`` you have it , all_right . 
but as_long_as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about . 
why , i once use this machine to cure a woman with 97 pound of cancer in her body '' . 
he urge her to buy one of his machine - for $ 300 . 
when she say that she did n't have the money , he say that she could come_in for treatment with his office model until she be ready to buy one . 
he then sell her mineral to cure her kidney ailment , a can of sage `` to make her look_like a girl again '' , and an application of plain mud to take_away her wrinkle away . 
person renew his pressure on person to buy his machine when she visit him the next day . 
after another treatment with the machine , he tell her that `` her entire body was shot_through with tumor and cyst '' . 
he then sell her some capsule that he assert would take_care of the tumor and cyst until she could collect the money for buy his machine . 
when she submit to his treatment with the capsule , person feel intense pain . 
leave person 's office , person hurry over to her family physician , who treat her for burn tissue . 
for several day , she be ill as a result of person 's treatment . 
person never get_around_to join the thousand or_so people who pay person some $ 30000 for his ozone machine . 
for person - who had been give a clean bill_of_health by her own physician at the time she visit person - and her friend be agent for the group and group . 
and she feel amply reward for her suffering when the evidence of person 's quack shenanigan , gather by the tape_recorder under her friend 's clothing , prove adequate in court for convict person . 
the charge : violation of the california medical_practice act by practice medicine without a license and sell misbranded drug . 
the sentence : 360 day ' confinement in the county jail . 
an isolated case of quackery ? 
by_no_means . 
rather , it be typical of the thousand of quack who use phony therapeutic device to fatten themselves on the misery of hundred of thousand of american by rob them of millions of dollar and lure them away from legitimate , ethical medical treatment of serious disease . 
the machine quack make his person device out of odds_and_ends of metal , wire , and radio part . 
with these gadget - impressive to the gullible because of their flash light_bulb , tick , and buzz - he then carry_out a vicious medical con_game , capitalize on people 's respect for the electrical and atomic wonder of our scientific age . 
he milk the latest scientific advance , translate them into his own special person vocabulary to huckster his fake machine as a cure-all for everything from hay_fever to sexual impotence and cancer . 
the gadget faker operate or sell his phony machine for $ 5 to $ 10000 - anything the traffic will bear . 
he may call himself a naprapath , a physical_therapist , an electrotherapist , a naturopath , a sanipractor , a medical cultist , a masseur , a `` doctor '' - or what have you . 
not_only do these quack assume impressive title , but represent themselves as be associated with various scientific or impressive foundation - foundation which often have little more than a letterhead existence . 
the medical device pirate of today , of_course , be a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor of yesteryear - the gallus snap hawker of snake_oil and other patent_medicine . 
his plunder be therefore far high - run into hundred of millions . 
according_to the group ( group ) , `` doctor '' person , person and his clique , and person - to name three notorious device quack - succeed , respectively , in distribute 10000 , 5000 , and 2000 fake health machine . 
authorities believe that many_of the doctor fraud use these false health gadget be still in business . 
look_at the sum pay by two device quack victim in cleveland . 
person , a dress_shop proprietor , pay $ 1020 to a masseur , and person , a laborer , pay $ 4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machine - the `` radioclast '' and the `` diagnometer '' . 
multiply these figure by the million of people know to be con by medical pirate annually . 
you will come_up with a frightening total . 
that 's why the group , the group ( group ) , and the person ( group ) have estimate the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $ 610 million or_so pay to medical charlatan annually . 
the postmaster_general recently report that mail_order fraud - among which fake therapeutic device figure prominently - be at the highest level in history . 
similarly , the group ( group ) , the group , and the group have each state lately that medical quackery be at a new high . 
for_example , the group has report it was receive four_times as many inquiry about quack device and 10 times as_many complaint compare with two year ago . 
authorities hesitate to quote exact figure , however , believe that any sum they come_up with be only a surface manifestation - turn_up by their inevitably limit police - of the real loot of the medical racketeer . 
in this sense , authorities believe that all estimate of phony device quackery be conservative . 
the economic toll that the device quack extracts be important , of_course . 
but it is our health - more precious than all the money in the world - that these modern witch_doctor with their fake therapeutic gadget are gamble away . 
by prey on the sick , by play callously on the hope of the desperate , by cause the sufferer to delay proper medical_care , these medical ghoul create pain and misery by their very activity . 
typically , person and person both lose more than their money as the result of their experience with their cleveland quack . 
person find that the treatment give her for a nervous ailment by the masseur were not help her . 
as a result , she consult medical authorities and learn that the device her quack `` doctor '' was use be phony . 
she suffer a nervous_breakdown and had to be institutionalize . 
person , her fellow townsman , also experience a nervous_breakdown just as_soon_as he discover that he had been bilk of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been treat his wife - a woman suffer from an incurable disease , multiple_sclerosis - and himself . 
person has recover , but he be , justifiably , a bitter man . 
`` that 's a lot of hard earned money to lose '' , he say today . 
`` neither me nor my wife were help by that chiropractor 's treatment '' . 
and there be the case of person , a machinist , who was refer by a friend to a health machine quack who treat him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what person say be a system full of arsenic and strychnine . 
after his pain get_worse , person decide to see a real doctor , from whom he learn he was suffer from cancer of the lung . 
yes , person catch it in_time to stay alive . 
but he be a welfare_case now - a human wreck - thank to this modern witch_doctor . 
but the machine quack can cause far more than just suffering . 
in such disease as cancer , tuberculosis , and heart_disease , early diagnosis and treatment be so vital that the waste_of_time by the patient with person 's cure-all gadget can prove fatal . 
moreover , the diabetic patient who rely_on cure by the quack device and therefore cut_off his insulin intake can be commit suicide . 
for_instance : 
in location , some time ago , person , age 27 , a diabetic since he be six , stop use insulin because he had buy a `` magic spike '' - a glass tube about the size of a pencil fill with barium chloride worth a small fraction of a cent - sell by the group of location for $ 306 as a cure-all . 
`` hang this around your neck or attach it to other part of your anatomy , and its ray will cure any disease you have '' , say the company . 
person be dead today because he follow this advice . 
person , suffer from tuberculosis , was take by her husband to see person , a sanipractor - a licensed drugless healer - in location . 
person diagnose person by take a drop of blood from her ear and put it on his `` radionic '' machine and twirl some knob ( fee $ 50 ) . 
his prescription : hot and cold compress to increase her absorption of water . 
although she weigh only 108 pound when she visit him , person permit her to go on a 10 - day fast in which she take nothing but water . 
inevitably , person die of starvation and tuberculosis , weigh 60 pound . 
moreover , her husband and child contract t.b. from her . 
( small wonder a location jury award the husband $ 35823 for his wife 's death . ) 
in location , a_few year ago , a ghoul by the name of person sell electric blanket as a cure for cancer . 
he do this by the charming practice of buy_up used electric blanket for $ 5 to $ 10 from survivor of patient who had die , recondition them , and sell them at $ 185 each . 
when authorities convict him of practice medicine without a license ( he get_off with a suspended sentence of three year because of his advanced age of 77 ) , one of his victim be not around to testify : he be dead of cancer . 
by_no_means be these isolated case . 
`` unfortunately '' , say person , who has prosecute many device quack , `` the ghoul who trade on the hope of the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecute because the patient who be the chief witness die before the case is call_up in court '' . 
death ! 
have no_doubt about it . 
that 's where device quackery can lead . 
the evidence show that fake therapeutic machine , substitute for valid medical cure , have hasten the death of thousand . 
who be the victim of the device quack ? 
authorities say that oldster be a prime target . 
say person , director of the group 's group : `` quack be apt to direct their appeal directly to older people , or to sufferer from chronic ailment such_as arthritis , rheumatism , diabetes , and cancer . 
people who have not be able to get relief from regular medical doctor be especially apt to be take_in by quack '' . 
the victim of the quack be frequently poor people , like person , who scrape_up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice to person 's avarice . 
they be often ignorant as_well_as underprivileged . 
the popularity of folklore in america stand in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in america . 
and the emphasis on nationalism in america be in_proportion_to the growth of american influence across the world . 
thus , if we are to observe american folklore in the twentieth century , we will do_well to establish the relationship between folklore , nationalism and imperialism at the outset . 
historian have come to recognize two cardinal fact concern nationalism and international influence . 
1 ) every age rewrite the event of its history in_terms_of what should have be , create legend about itself that rationalize contemporary belief and excuse contemporary action . 
what actually occur in the past be seldom as important as what a given generation feel must have occur . 
2 ) as a country superimpose its cultural and political attitude on others , it search its heritage in hope of justify its aggressiveness . 
its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allow to account_for group_action , to provide a focal_point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification . 
one can apply these fact to britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth century as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be apply again to the united_states in more recent year . 
the popularity of local color literature before the spanish-american_war , the steady currency of the lincoln myth , the increased emphasis on the frontier west in our mass_media be case_in_point . 
nor is it an accident that baseball , grow into the national game in the last 75 year , has become a microcosm of american life , that learned society such_as the group and the group were found in the 1880's , or that course in american literature , american civilization , american anything have sweep our school and college curriculum . 
of_course , nationalism has really outlive its usefulness in a country as world oriented as ours , and its continued existence reflect one of the major culture lag of the twentieth century united_states . 
yet nationalism has lose few of its charm for the historian , writer or man_in_the_street . 
it is an understandable paradox that most american history and most american literature be today write from an essentially egocentric and isolationist point_of_view at the very time america is spread her dominion over palm and pine . 
after_all , the average american as he lie and wait for the enemy in korea or as she scan the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front be unconcerned that his or her plight be the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental action far beyond the normal citizen 's comprehension and control . 
anyone 's identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , require absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement . 
such identification come for each group in each crisis by rewrite history into legend and develop appropriate national hero . 
in america , such self-deception has serve a particularly useful purpose . 
a heterogeneous people have need it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever-changing land . 
but we must never forget , most_of the appropriate hero and their legend were create overnight , to answer immediate need , almost always with conscious aim and end . 
person 's george_washington become the symbol of honesty and the father image of the unite state . 
abraham_lincoln emerge as an incarnation of the national constitution . 
robert_e_lee represent the dignity needed by a rebelling confederacy . 
and their role are parallel by those of person , person , person , person , person and many , many more . 
therefore , the scholar , as he look_at our national folklore of the last 60 year , will be mindful of two fact . 
1 ) most_of the legend that are create to fan the fires of patriotism be essentially propagandistic and be not folk legend at_all . 
2 ) the concept that an `` american national folklore '' exist be itself probably another propagandistic legend . 
folklore be individually create art that a homogeneous group of people preserve , vary and recreate through oral transmission . 
it has come to mean myth , legend , tale , song , proverb , riddle , superstition , rhyme and such literary form of expression . 
relate to written literature , and often remain temporarily freeze in written form , it lose its vitality when transcribe or remove from its oral existence . 
though it may exist in either literate or illiterate society , it assume a role of true cultural importance only in the latter . 
in its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage , the public has remain ignorant of definition such as this . 
enthusiastically , american have sweep_up subliterary and bogus material like person tale , abraham_lincoln anecdote and labor_union song up as true product of our american oral tradition . 
nor have we remember that in the melting_pot of america the hundred of isolated and semi isolated ethnic , regional and occupational group did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had cause them to cast_aside oral tradition aside as a means of carry culturally significant material . 
naturally , such scholarly fact be of little concern to the man try to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore . 
that much of what he call folklore be the result of belief carefully sow among the people with the conscious aim of produce a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situation be irrelevant . 
as_long_as his material be americana , can in_some_way be ascribe to the masses and appear `` democratic '' to his audience , he remain satisfied . 
from all this we can now see that two stream of development run through the history of twentieth century american folklore . 
on the one side we have the university professor and their student , train in teutonic method of research , who have seek_out , collect and study the true product of the oral tradition of the ethnic , regional and occupational group that make_up this nation . 
on the other we have the flag-waver and the national sentimentalist who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western '' or colonial material willy-nilly . 
unfortunately , few of the artist ( writer , movie producer , dramatist and musician ) who have use american folklore since 1900 have know enough to distinguish between the two stream even in the most general of way . 
after_all , the field be large , difficult to define and seldom teach properly to american undergraduate . 
in_addition , this country has been settle by many people of many heritage and their lore has become acculturate slowly , in an age of print and easy communication , within an ever expanding and changing society . 
the problem confuse even the expert . 
for_that_matter , the expert themselves be a mixed breed . 
anthropologist , housewife , historian and such by profession , they approach their discipline as amateur , collector , commercial propagandist , analyst or some combination of the four . 
they have widely varying background and aim . 
they have little `` esprit_de_corps '' . 
the outlook for the amateur , for_instance , be usually dependent_on his fondness for local history or for the picturesque . 
his love of folklore have romanticism in it , and he does n't care much about the dollar_sign or the footnote . 
folklore be his hobby , and he , all_too rightly , wish it to remain as such . 
the amateur be closely related to the collector , who be actually no more_than the amateur who has take_to the field . 
the collector enjoy the contact with rural life ; he hunt folklore for the very `` field and stream '' reason that many person hunt game ; and only rarely be he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has locate . 
fundamentally , both these type , the amateur and the collector , be uncritical and many of them do n't distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material . 
but there are also the commercial propagandist and the analyst - one dominated_by money , the other by nineteenth century german scholarship . 
both be primarily concerned with the use that can be make of the material that the collector has find . 
both shudder at the thought of proceed too far beyond the sewage_system and the electric light line . 
the commercial propagandist , who can n't afford to be critical , get_along well with the amateur , from whom he feed , but he frequently steps on the analyst 's toes by refuse to keep his material genuine . 
his standard be , of_course , completely foreign to those of the analyst . 
to both the amateur and the commercial propagandist the analyst lack a soul , lack appreciation with his endless probing and classification . 
dominated_by the vicious_circle of the university promotion_system , the analyst looks_down_on and get_along poorly with the other three group , although he cannot deny his debt to the collector . 
the knowledge that most american have of folklore come through contact with commercial propagandist and a_few energetic amateur and collector . 
the work do by the analyst , the man who really know what folklore be all about , have no_more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort and reach a limited , learned audience . 
publisher want book that will sell , recording_studio want disc that will not seem strange to ear used_to hillbilly_music and jazz music , grade_school and high_school want quaint , but moral , material . 
the analyst be apt to be too honest to fit_in . 
as a result , most people do n't have more than a vague idea what folklore actually be ; they see it as a potpourri of charming , moral legend and patriotic anecdote , with a superstition or remedy throw_in here_and_there . 
and so well is such ignorance preserve by the amateur and the moneymaker that even at the college_level most_of the hundred odd folklore course give in the united_states survive on sentiment and nationalism alone . 
if one wish to discuss a literary figure who use folklore in his work , the first thing he must realize be that the literary figure be probably part of this ignorant american public . 
and while every writer must be deal with as a special case , the interested student will want to ask himself a number of question about each . 
does the writer know the difference between an `` ersatz '' ballad or tall_tale and a true product of the folk ? 
when the writer use material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial effect or does he leave it pure ? 
be the writer propagandistic ? 
is he sweep_away by sentiment and nostalgia for an america that be ? 
or does he sincerely want to tap the real spring of american attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be ? 
when he get the answer to his question he will be discouraged . 
in_the_first_place , a good many writer who are say to use folklore , do not , unless one count an occasional superstition or tale . 
person , for_instance , write about rural life in new_england , but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poem . 
this has not , however , prevent publisher from label him a `` folk_poet '' , simply because he be a rural one . 
in the second place , a large_number of writer , make a more direct claim than person to be `` folk_writer '' of one sort or another , clearly make no distinction between genuine and bogus material . 
person 's john_brown's_body come immediately to mind in this connection , as does person 's the_grapes_of_wrath and person 's the_people,_yes . 
the last two writer introduce strong political bias into their work , and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon , see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publicly silenced mass . 
folklore , as use by such writer , really reflect image engrave into it by the very person use it . 
the folk be simply not homogeneous with_respect_to nation or political attitude . 
in_fact , there is much evidence to indicate they do n't care a_bit about anything beyond their particular regional , ethnic and occupational limit . 
nevertheless , with a reading public that long for `` the_good_old_days '' and with an awareness of our expanding international interest , it is easy for the person to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sort of americana , real or fake , and it is easy for the person and person to support their message of reform by read message of reform into the mind of the folk . 
color was delay until 1935 , the wide_screen until the early fifties . 
movement itself be the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movie of the nineties . 
each film consist_of fifty foot , which give a running_time of about one minute on the screen . 
as_long_as audience come to see the movement , there seem little reason to adventure further . 
motion_picture exhibition take_place in store in a general atmosphere like that of the penny_arcade which can still be find in such urban_area as location . 
brief snip of actual event were show : parade , dance , street scene . 
the sensational and frightening enjoy popularity : 
a train rush straight at the audience , or a great wave threaten to break over the seat . 
an early person production be the_execution_of_mary_queen_of_scotts . 
the unfortunate queen mount the scaffold ; the headsman swing his axe ; the head drop off ; end of film . 
an early film by a competitor of the wizard of location simply show a long kiss perform by two actor of the contemporary stage . 
in the field of entertainment there be no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom , and the first decade of the new device be not over before audience begin stay away in large_number from the simple-minded , one minute show . 
in response , the industry allow the discovery of the motion_picture as a form of fiction and thus give the movie the essential form they have have to this day . 
despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentary , art film , and travelogue , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as cinerama , the movie be at_heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short_story . 
moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction film have invariably borrow the narrative form from the fiction feature . 
thus such great american documentary as the_river and the_plow_that_broke_the_plains were compose as visual story rather_than as illustrate lecture . 
the discovery that movie be a form of fiction was make in the early year of this century and it was make chiefly by two man , a french magician , person , and an american employee of person , person . 
of the two , person be justly the better_known , for he go far beyond the vital finding of fiction for film to take the first_step toward fashion a language of film , toward make the motion_picture the intricate , efficient time_machine that it has remain since , even in the most inept hands . 
person , however , out of his professional instinct as a magician , discover and make use of a number of illusionary technique that remain part of the vocabulary of film . 
one of these is the `` dissolve '' , which make possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene . 
as the first scene begin to fade , the succeeding scene begin to appear . 
for a moment or two , both scene be present simultaneously , one grow weak , one grow strong . 
in a series of fairytale and fantasy , person demonstrate that the film be superbly equipped to tell a straightforward story , with beginning , middle and end , complication , resolution , climax , and conclusion . 
immediately , the film improve and it improve because in narrative it find a content base on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time . 
physically , a movie be possible because a series of image is project one at_a_time at such a speed that the eye `` remember '' the one that has go before even as it register the one now appear . 
link the smoothly changing image together , the eye itself endow them with the illusion of movement . 
the `` projection '' time of painting and sculpture be highly subjective , vary from person to person and even vary for a given person on different occasion . 
so be the time of the novel . 
the drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time , but the time is fix by the director and the player , the conductor and the instrumentalist , subject_to , therefore , to much variation , as record collector well know . 
the time of the motion_picture is fixed absolutely . 
the film consist_of a series of still , transparent photograph , or `` frame '' , 35 - mm - wide . 
each frame come between the light and the lens and is individually project on the screen , at the rate , for silent_movie , of 16 frame per second , and , for sound film , 24 frame per second . 
this be the rate of projection ; it be also the rate of photograph . 
time is build into the motion_picture , which cannot exist without time . 
now time be also the concern of the fictional narrative , which be , at its simple , the story of an action with , usually , a beginning , a middle , and an end - element which demand time as the first condition for their existence . 
the `` moving '' picture of the train or the wave come at the audience be , to_be_sure , more intense than a still picture of the same subject , but the difference be really one of degree ; the cinematic element of time is merely use to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo . 
in narrative , time be essential , as it be in film . 
almost everything about the movie that is peculiarly of the movie derive from a tension create and maintain between narrative time and film time . 
this discovery of person be vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling , magician 's trick produce on film . 
it be person , however , who produce the very first movie whose name has live on through the half century of film history that has since ensue . 
the movie be the great_train_robbery and its effect on the young industry and art be all_but incalculable . 
overnight , for_one_thing , person 's film multiply the standard running_time of movie by ten . 
the great_train_robbery be a one reel film . 
one reel - from eight to twelve minute - become the standard length from the year of robbery , 1903 , until person shatter that limit forever with birth_of_a_nation in 1915 . 
the reel itself become and still be the standard of measure for the movie . 
the material of the person film be simplicity itself ; much of_it has continue to be use over the year and the heart of_it - good_guy and bad_guy in the old west - pretty well dominate television toward the end of the 1950's . 
a band of robber enter a railroad_station , overpower and tie_up the telegraph_operator , hold_up the train and escape . 
a posse is form and pursue the robber , who , having make their escape , are whoop_it_up with some wild , wild woman in a honky-tonk hideout . 
the robber run from the hideout , take cover in a wooded declivity , and are shoot dead by the posse . 
as a finale is append a closeup of one of the band take_aim and fire his revolver straight at the audience . 
all this be simple enough , but in tell the story person do two important thing that had not been do before . 
each scene is shoot straight through , as had be the universal custom , from a camera fix in a single position , but in the outdoor scene , especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaw , person 's camera position break , necessarily , with the camera position standard until then , which had be , roughly , that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play . 
the plane of the action in the scene be not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen . 
if the change , at_first_sight , seem minor , we may recall that it take the italian painter about two hundred year to make an analogous change , and the italian painter , by universal consent , be the most brilliant group of genius any art has see . 
in that apparently simple shift person open the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as_well_as a mechanical recording device . 
he do more than that . 
he reveal the potential value of the `` cut '' as the basic technique in the art of the film . 
cutting , of_course , take_place automatically in the creation of a film . 
the meaning of the word be quite physical , to_begin_with . 
the physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence , and the cut edge is join physically , by cement , to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence . 
if , as a home_movie maker , you shoot the inevitable footage of your child take its first steps , you have merely record an historical event . 
if , in prepare that shot for the inevitable showing to your friend , you interrupt the sequence to paste in a_few frame of the child 's grandmother watch this event , you have begin to be an artist in film ; you are employ the basic technique of film ; you are cut . 
this be what person do . 
as the robber leave the looted train , the film suddenly cut_back to the station , where the telegrapher 's little daughter arrive with her father 's dinner_pail only to find him bound on the floor . 
she dash around in alarm . 
the two event are take_place at_the_same_time . 
time and space have both become cinematic . 
we leap from event to event - include the formation of the posse - even though the event , in_reality `` reality '' are take_place not in sequence but simultaneously , and not near each other but at a considerable distance . 
the `` chase '' as a standard film device probably date_from the_great_train_robbery , and there be a reason for the continued popularity of the device . 
the chase in itself be a narrative ; it presume both speed and urgency and it demand cutting - both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both . 
the simple , naked idea of one man chase another be of its nature better fit for the film than it is for any other form of fiction . 
the cowboy film , the cop and robber film , and the slapstick comedy film culminate in an insane chase are not_only cater to what critic may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence ; these film and these sequence are also seek_out - instinctively or by_design - the peculiarly cinematic element of narrative . 
there still remain the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art . 
the man be person . 
when he come to the movie - more_or_less by accident - they be still cheap entertainment capable of enthrall the unthinking for an idle few minute . 
in about seven year person either invent or first realize the possibility of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film_maker . 
before he be forty person had create the art of the film . 
not that there had not be attempt , mostly european , to do exactly that . 
but in_general the european effort to make an art of the entertainment had ignore the slowly emerge language of the film itself . 
staggeringly condensed version of famous novel and famous play were present . 
great actor and actress - the most notable be person - were hire to repeat their stage performance before the camera . 
in all_of this extensive and expensive effort , the camera was downgrade to the status of recording instrument for art produce elsewhere by the actor or by the author . 
the phonograph today , for all its high_fidelity and stereophonic sound , be precisely what the early art purveyor in the movie wish to make of the camera . 
not surprisingly , this approach did not work . 
the effort produce a valuable record of stage technique in the early year of the century and some interesting record of great theater figure who would otherwise be only name . 
but no art at_all be_born of the art effort in the early movie . 
northern liberal be the chief supporter of civil_rights and of integration . 
they have also lead the nation in the direction of a welfare_state . 
and both in their objective of non-discrimination and of social progress they have had range against them the southerner who are called bourbon . 
the name presumably derive from the french royal_house which never learn and never forget ; since bourbon whiskey , though of kentucky origin , be at_least as much favored by liberal in the north as by conservative in the south . 
the nature of the opposition between liberal and bourbon is too little understand in the north . 
the race_problem has tend to obscure other , less emotional , issue which may fundamentally be even more divisive . 
it be these other difference between north and south - other_than , that_is , than those which concern discrimination or social_welfare - which i chiefly discuss herein . 
i write about northern liberal from considerable personal experience . 
a southerner marry to a new_englander , i have live for many year in a connecticut commuting town with a high percentage of artist , writer , publicity_man , and business_executive of egghead taste . 
most_of them be democrat and nearly all consider themselves , and are view_as , liberal . 
this be puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism , because it be clear that these democrat who be left-of-center be at opposite pole from the liberal person , who hold that the best government be the least government . 
yet paradoxically my liberal friend continue to view person as one of their patron_saint . 
when i question them as_to what they mean by concept like liberty and democracy , i find that they fall_into two category : the simple ones who have simply accept the shibboleth of their faith without analysis ; and the intelligent , cynical ones who scornfully reply that these thing do n't count anymore in the world of today . 
i be naive , they say , to make use of such word . 
i take this to mean that the intelligent - and therefore necessarily cynical ? 
- liberal consider that the need for a national economy with control that will assure his conception of social justice be so great that individual and local liberty as_well_as democratic process may have to yield before it . 
this seem like an attitude favor a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which , under a president of the same stamp , would try to coerce an uncooperative congress or supreme_court . 
as for state ' right , they have never count in the thinking of my liberal friend except as irritation of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronism . 
the american liberal may , in the world of today , have a strong case ; but he present it publicly so enmesh in hypocrisy that it be not an honest one . 
why , in_the_first_place , call himself a liberal if he be against laissez_faire and favor an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb control over everybody ? 
if he attach little importance to personal liberty , why not make this known to the world ? 
and if he be so scornful of the right of state , why not advocate a different sort of constitution that he could more sincerely support ? 
i am concern here , however , with the northern liberal 's attitude toward the south . 
it appear to be one of intense dislike , which he make little effort to conceal even in the presence of southern friend . 
his assumption seem to be that any such friend , be tolerable human , must be more liberal than most southerner and therefore at_least partly in_sympathy_with his view . 
group 's editor , person , in his book , the waist high culture , write : `` most of what be different about it ( the deep_south ) i find myself unsympathetic to '' . 
this , for the liberal i know , would be an understatement . 
theirs be no mere lack of sympathy , but something close to the passionate hatred that was direct against fascism . 
i do not think that my experience would be typical for southerner live in the north . 
in business circle , usually conservative , this sort of atmosphere would hardly be find . 
but in our case - and neither my wife nor i have extreme view on integration , nor be we given to emotional outburst - the situation has ruin one or two valued friendship and come_close to wreck several more . 
in_fact it has cause us to give serious thought to move our residence south , because it be not easy for the most objective southerner to sit_by calmly by when his host is tell a roomful of people that the only way to deal with southerner who oppose integration be to send in troops and shoot the bastard down . 
account have been publish of northern liberal in the south up_against segregationist prejudice , especially in state-supported university where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view . 
but these account do not show that northerner have been subject to embarrassment or provocation by yankee hatred display in social gathering . 
from my wife 's experience and other source , this seem to be rarely encounter in educated circle . 
the strong feeling is certainly there ; but there be a leavening of liberalism among college graduate throughout the south , especially among those who study in the north . 
and social_relation arise out of business tie impose courtesy , if not sympathy , toward resident and visit northerner . 
also , among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent southern attitude on most social problem . 
there be of_course many south ; but for this discussion the most important division be between those who have been reconstruct and those who have n't . 
my definition of this much abused adjective be that a reconstructed rebel be one who be glad that the north win the war . 
nobody know how many southerner there be in this category . 
i suspect that there be far more unreconstructed ones than the north like to believe . 
i never hear of a poll being take on the question . 
no_doubt such a thing would be consider unpatriotic . 
prior to 1954 i imagine that a majority of southerner would have vote against the confederacy . 
since the supreme_court 's decision of that year this be more doubtful ; and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to little_rock i believe the majority would have be for the old_south . 
belief in the traditional way_of_life persist much more in the old state than in the new ones . 
probably a large percentage of virginian and south_carolinian remain unreconstructed than elsewhere , with georgia , north_carolina , and alabama follow along after them . 
old attitude are hold more tenaciously in the tidewater than the piedmont ; so_that a line run down the length of the south mark the upper_limit of tidewater would roughly divide the old_south from the new , but with , of_course , important minority enclave . 
the long settled area of state like virginia and south_carolina develop the antebellum culture to its rich flowering , and there the memory be more precious , and the consciousness of loss the great . 
also , we should not even today discount the fact that a region such_as the coastal lowland center_on charleston have close tie with england and the west_indies than with the north even after independence . 
the social and psychological consequence of this continue to affect the area . 
in certain respect defeat increase the persistent anglophilia of the old_south . 
poor where they had once be rich , humble where they had be arrogant , have no_longer any hope of share_in the leadership of the nation , the rebel who would not surrender in spirit draw comfort from the sympathy they feel extend to them by the mother_country . 
and no_doubt many people in state like the location and georgia , which be among the most tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regret the revolt against the crown . 
among bourbon the racial issue may have less to do with their remain unreconstructed than other factor . 
all southerner agree that slavery had to go ; but many historian maintain that except for northern meddling it would have end in state like virginia year before it did . 
southern resentment has be over the method of its ending , the invasion , and reconstruction ; their fear now be of miscegenation and negro political control in many county . 
but apart from racial problem , the old unreconstructed south - to use the moderate word favored by person - find itself unsympathetic to most of what be different about the civilization of the north . 
and this , in_effect , mean most of modern america . 
it be hard to see how the situation could be otherwise . 
and therein , i feel , many northerner delude themselves about the south . 
for_one_thing , this be not a subject often discuss or analyze . 
there seem to be almost a conspiracy of silence veil it . 
i suppose the reason be a kind of wishful_thinking : do n't talk_about the final stage of reconstruction and they will take_care of themselves . 
or_else the north really believe that all southerner except a_few quaint old character have come_around to realize the error of their past , and be now at_heart sharer of the american_dream , like everybody else . 
if the circumstance are face frankly it be not reasonable to expect this to be true . 
the situation of the south since 1865 has be unique in the western world . 
regardless_of right and wrong , a population and an area appropriate to a pre world_war_i , great_power have been , following conquest , rule against their will by a neighboring people , and have had impose upon them social and economic control they dislike . 
and the great majority of these people be of anglo-saxon or celtic descent . 
this be the only case in modern history of a_people of britannic origin submit without continued struggle to what they view_as foreign domination . 
the fact be_due mainly to international war , both hot_war and cold_war . 
in every war of the united_states since the civil_war the south be more belligerent than the rest of the country . 
so instead of be test of the south 's loyalty , the spanish-american_war , the two world_war , and the korean_war all serve to overcome old grievance and cement reunion . 
and there be no section of the nation more ardent than the south in the cold_war against communism . 
had the situation been reverse , had , for_instance , england be the enemy in 1898 because of issue of concern chiefly to new_england , there be little doubt that large_number of southerner would have happily put_on their old confederate uniform to fight as ally of britain . 
it be extraordinary that a_people as proud and warlike as southerner should have be as docile as they have . 
the north should thank_its_stars that such has be the case ; but at_the_same_time it should not draw false inference therefrom . 
the two main charge level against the bourbon by liberal be that they be racist and social reactionary . 
there be much truth in both these charge , and not many bourbon deny them . 
whatever their fault , they be not hypocrite . 
most_of them sincerely believe that the anglo-saxon be the best race in the world and that it should remain pure . 
many northerner believe this , too , but few of them will say so publicly . 
the bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , be not very different from that of northern conservative . 
but those among the bourbon who remain unreconstructed go much further than this . 
they believe that if the south had been let_alone it would have produce a civilization superior to that of modern america . 
as_it_is , they consider that the north is now reap the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in_spite_of its high standard_of_living the `` american way '' has been prove inferior to the english and scandinavian way , although they disapprove of the socialistic feature of the latter . 
the south 's antipathy to northern civilization include such charge as poor manners , harsh accent , lack of appreciation of the art of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure . 
their own easy , slow tempo be especially dear to southerner ; and i have hear many say that they be content to earn a half or a third as_much_as they could up north because they so much prefer the quiet habit of their hometown . 
as cell coalesce into organism , they build new `` unnatural '' and internally control environment to cope even more successfully with the entropy increasing property of the external world . 
the useful suggestion of person which consider culture as a third stage in biological evolution fit quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provide us with a rather successful technique for build protective artificial environment . 
one wonder about its applicability to people . 
will advance in human science help us build social_structure and government which will enable us to cope_with people as_effectively_as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic_acid build a structure of molecule which enable it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ? 
the answer be of_course yes . 
for the family be the simple example of just such a unit , compose of people , which give us both some immunity from , and a way of deal with , other people . 
social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await person or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulation of person . 
but it has been during the last two century , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has make the most rapid stride . 
we have ample light when the sun set ; the temperature of our home be independent of the season ; we fly through the air , although gravity pull us down ; the range of our voice ignore distance . 
at what stage be social_science then ? 
be the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of newton ? 
there be a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in person and in freud . 
and it be certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievement and their impact . 
political theoretical understanding , although almost at a standstill during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth century , and result in a flood of invention which increase the possibility for man to coexist with man . 
constitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor_union , cooperative , commune , socialized ownership , world_court , and the veto power in world_council be but a_few example . 
most_of these , with horrible exception , were conceive as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it . 
the most effective political invention seem to make maximum use of natural harbor and be aware that restrain breakwater can play only a minor part in the whole scheme . 
just as present technology had to await the explanation of physics , so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding . 
we be desperately in the need of such invention , for man be still very_much at the mercy of man . 
in_fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is day_by_day increase our fear of each other . 
i want , therefore , to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science , the connection between scientific understanding and fear . 
there be certainly large area of understanding in the human science which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fear . 
person has remark : `` the reason why all mortal are so grip by fear be that they see all sort of thing happen in the earth and sky with no discernable cause , and these they attribute to the will of god '' . 
perhaps thing be even worse then . 
it be difficult to reconstruct the primeval fear of man . 
we get some clue from a_few remembrance of childhood and from the circumstance that we be probably not much more afraid of people now than man ever be . 
we be not now afraid of atomic_bomb in the same way that people once fear comet . 
the bomb be as_harmless_as an automobile in a garage . 
we be worried about what people may do with them - that some crazy fool may `` push the button '' . 
i be certainly not adequately train to describe or enlarge on human fear , but there be certain feature of the fear dispel by scientific explanation that stand_out quite clearly . 
they be in_general those fear that once seem to have be amenable to prayer or ritual . 
they include both individual fear and collective ones . 
they arise in situation in which one believe that what happen depend not_only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group . 
often it is recognize that all the detail of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determine and not develop through theoretical understanding , one be never quite certain which behavior element be effective , and the whole pattern become ritualize . 
yet often fear persist because , even with the most rigid ritual , one be never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had be unaware of the really decisive act . 
to say that science had reduce many such fear merely reiterate the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminate much of magic and superstition . 
but a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating . 
the frequently postulate antique worry that the daylight hour might dwindle to complete darkness apparently give_rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize . 
it be curious that even century of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremony of the winter_solstice . 
this and other fear of the solar_system have disappear gradually , first , with the ptolemaic_system and its built-in concept of periodicity and_then , more firmly , with the newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account_for quantitatively for both terrestrial and celestial motion . 
this understanding provide a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without institute any control . 
in_fact , although we have dispel the fear , we have not necessarily assure ourselves that there be no danger . 
there be still the remote possibility of planetoid collision . 
a meteor could fall on san_francisco . 
solar activity could presumably bring long period of flood or drought . 
our understanding of the solar_system has teach us to replace our former elaborate ritual with the appropriate action which , in this case , amount to do nothing . 
yet we no_longer feel uneasy . 
this almost trivial example be nevertheless suggestive , for there be some element in_common between the antique fear that the day would get short and short and our present fear of war . 
we , in our country , think_of war as an external threat which , if it occur , will not be primarily of our own doing . 
and yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depend in some obscure or at_least uncertain way on the detail of how we behave . 
what element of our behavior be decisive ? 
our weapon production , our world prestige , our idea of democracy , our action of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage ? 
we have stave_off a war and , since our behavior has involve all these element , we can only keep add to our ritual without dare to abandon any part of_it , since we have not the slight notion which part be effective . 
i think that we are here also talk_about the kind of fear that a young boy have for a group of boy who are approach at night along the street of a large city . 
if an automobile were approach him , he would know what was require of him , even_though he might not be able to act quickly enough . 
with the group of boy it be different . 
he does not know whether to look up or look aside , to put his hand in his pocket or to clench them at his side , to cross the street , or to continue on the same side . 
when confront with a drunk or an insane person i have no notion of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others . 
i believe that what i do have some effect on his action and i have learn , in_a_way , to commune with drunk , but certainly my action seem to resemble more nearly the performance of a rain_dance than the carry_out of an experiment in physics . 
i am usually fill with an uneasiness that through some unwitting slip all hell may break_loose . 
our inability to explain why certain people be fond of us frequently induce the same kind of ritual and malaise . 
we are force , in our behavior towards others , to adopt empirically successful pattern in_toto because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential element . 
our collective policy , group and national , are similarly base on voodoo , but here we often lack even the empirically successful ritual and are still engage in determine them . 
we use term from our personal experience with individual such_as `` trust '' , `` cheat '' , and `` get_tough '' . 
we talk_about national character in the same way that person talk of the compulsion of celestial_body to move in circle . 
we perform elaborate international exhortation and ceremony with virtually no understanding of social cause and effect . 
small wonder , then , that we fear . 
the achievement which dispel our fear of the cosmos take_place three century ago . 
what additional role has the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th century play ? 
in the physical_science , these achievement concern electricity , chemistry , and atomic_physics . 
in the life_science , there has be an enormous increase in our understanding of disease , in the mechanism of heredity , and in biological - and physiological chemistry . 
the major effect of these advance appear to lie_in the part they have play in the industrial_revolution and in the tool which scientific understanding has give us to build and manipulate a more protective environment . 
in_addition , our way of deal directly with natural_phenomenon has also change . 
even in domain where detailed and predictive understanding be still lack , but where some explanation be possible , as with lightning and weather and earthquake , the appropriate kind of human_action has been more adequately indicate . 
apparently the population as_a_whole eventually acquire enough confidence in the explanation of the scientist to modify its procedure and its fear . 
how and why this process occur would provide an interesting separate subject for study . 
in some area , the progress be slow than in others . 
in agriculture , for_example , despite the advance in biology , elaborate ritual tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence of some natural disaster . 
in child_care , the opposite extreme prevail ; procedure change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceed anything warrant by established psychological theory . 
there be many domain in which understanding has bring_about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear . 
much of the former extreme uneasiness associate with vision and hallucination and with death has disappear . 
the persistent horror of have a malformed child has , i believe , been reduce , not because we have gain any control over this misfortune , but precisely because we have learn that we have so little control over it . 
in_fact , the recent warning about the use of x_ray have introduce fear and ambiguity of action which now require more detailed understanding , and thus in_this instance , science has momentarily aggravate our fear . 
in_fact , insofar as science generate any fear , it stem not so much from scientific prowess and gadget but from the fact that new unanswered question arise , which , until they are understand , create uncertainty . 
perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derive from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease . 
the situation with regard_to our attitude and `` control '' of disease contain close analogy to problem confront us with_respect_to people . 
the fear of disease be formerly very_much the kind of fear i have try to describe . 
it is worth dwell in some detail on the crisis of this story , because it bring_together a number of characteristic element and make of them a curious , riddle compound obscurely but centrally significant for person 's work . 
the wife , person , and her lover are both savagely portray , she as incarnate sensuality , `` voluptuous '' and `` indolent '' , possibly `` a mischief maker '' , with `` a kind of luxurious cunning '' to set against her apparent simplicity , her `` bird like brain '' . 
person , for his part , `` belong_to the present-day race of small artist , who do not demand the utmost of themselves '' , and the bitter description of the type include such epithet as `` wretched little poseur '' , the devastating indictment `` they do not know how to be wretched decently and in_order '' , and the somewhat extreme prophecy , so_far not fulfill : `` they will be destroy '' . 
the trick these two play upon person reveal their want not simply of decency but of imagination as_well . 
his appearance as person evoke not amusement but horror in the audience ; it be a spectacle absolutely painful , an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit , untouched by any spirit other_than abasement and humiliation . 
at_the_same_time the multiple transvestitism involve - the fat man as girl and as baby , as coquette pretend to be a baby - touch_on for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret source of a life like person 's , upon the sinister dream which form the source of any human life . 
the music which person has compose for this episode be for_the_most_part `` rather pretty and perfectly banal '' . 
but it be characteristic of him , we are tell , `` his little artifice '' , to be able to introduce `` into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art '' . 
and this occur now , at the refrain of person 's song - at the point , in_fact , of the name `` person '' - ; a modulation describe as `` almost a stroke of genius '' . 
`` a miracle , a revelation , it be like a curtain suddenly tear_away to reveal something nude '' . 
it is this modulation which reveal to person his own frightful abjection and , simultaneously , his wife 's infidelity . 
by the same means he perceive this fact as having communicate itself to the audience ; he collapse , and die . 
in the work of every artist , i suppose , there may be find one or more moment which strike the student as absolutely decisive , ultimately emblematic of what it be all about ; not less strikingly so for be mysterious , as though some deeply hidden constatation of thought were encipher in a single image , a single moment . 
so here . 
the horrifying humor , the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke go_wrong , the monstrous image of the fat man dress_up as a whore dress_up as a baby ; the epiphany of that quivering flesh ; the bring_together around it of the secret liaison between indolent , mindless sensuality and sharp , shrewd talent , cleverness with an occasional touch of genius ( which , however , does not know `` how to attack the problem of suffering '' ) ; the miraculous way in which music , revelation and death are associate in a single instant - all this seem a triumph of art , a rather desperate art , in itself ; beyond itself , also , it evoke numerous and distant resonance from the entire body of person 's work . 
when i try to work_out my reason for feel that this passage be of critical significance , i come_up with the following idea , which i shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay . 
love be the crucial dilemma of experience for person 's hero . 
the dramatic construction of his story characteristically turn_on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compel and forbid to love . 
the release , the freedom , involve in love another be either terribly difficult or_else absolutely impossible ; and the motion toward it bring disaster . 
this prohibition on love have an especially poignant relation to art ; it is particularly the artist ( person , person , person ) who suffer from it . 
the specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem of the `` breakthrough '' in the realm of art . 
again , the suffering and disaster produce by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood , with the figure of a child . 
finally , the theatrical ( and perversely erotic ) notion of dress_up , cosmetics , disguise , and especially change of costume ( or singularity of costume , as with person ) , are characteristically associate with the catastrophe of person 's story . 
we shall return to these statement and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulate . 
for the present it be enough to note that in the grotesque figure of person , at the moment of his collapse , all these element come together in prophetic parody . 
professionally a lawyer , that_is_to_say associated with dignity , reserve , discipline , with much that be essentially middle-class , he is compel by an impossible love to exhibit himself dress_up , disguised - that_is , paradoxically , reveal - as a child , and , worse , as a whore masquerade as a child . 
that this abandonment take_place on a stage , during an ' artistic ' performance , be enough to associate person with art , and to bring_down upon him the punishment for art ; that_is , he be suspect , guilty , punishable , as be anyone in person 's story who produce illusion , and this be true even_though the constant element of the artist nature , technique , magic , guilt and suffering , are divided in this story between person and person . 
it appear that the dominant tendency of person 's early tale , however pictorial or even picturesque the surface , be already toward the symbolic , the emblematic , the expressionistic . 
in a certain perfectly definite way , the method and the theme of his story be one_and_the_same . 
something of this can be learn from `` the_way_to_the_churchyard '' ( 1901 ) , an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist cause him to die of a stroke or seizure . 
there be no_more `` plot '' than that ; only slightly more , perhaps , than a newspaper account of such an incident would give . 
the artistic interest , then , lie_in what the encounter may be make to represent , in the power of some central significance to draw the detail into relevance and meaningfulness . 
the first sentence , with its platitudinous irony , announce an emblematic intent : `` the way to the churchyard run_along beside the highroad , run beside it all_the_way to the end ; that_is_to_say , to the churchyard '' . 
and the action is consistently present with regard for this distinction . 
the highroad , one might say at_first , belong_to life , while the way to the churchyard belong_to death . 
but that is too simple , and won't hold_up . 
as the first sentence suggest , both road belong_to death in_the_end . 
but the highroad , according_to the description of its traffic , belong_to life as it is live in unawareness of death , while the way to the churchyard belong_to some other sort of life : 
a suffering form , an existence wholly comprise in the awareness of death . 
thus , on the highroad , a troop of soldier `` march in their own dust and sing '' , while on the footpath one man walk alone . 
this man 's isolation be not merely momentary , it be permanent . 
he be a widower , his three child be dead , he have no_one leave on earth ; also he be a drunk , and has lose his job on_that_account . 
his name be person , and he is rather fully describe as_to his clothing and physiognomy in_a_way which relate him to a sinister type in the author 's repertory - he be a forerunner of those enigmatic stranger in `` death_in_venice '' , for_example , who represent some combination of cadaver , exotic , and psychopomp . 
this strange person quarrel with a cyclist because the latter is use the path rather_than the highroad . 
the cyclist , a sufficiently commonplace young fellow , is not name but identify simply as `` person '' - that and a license_number , which person use in address him . 
`` person '' point_out that `` everybody use this path '' , and start to ride on . 
person try to stop him by force , receive a push in the chest from `` person '' , and is leave stand in impotent and growing rage , while a crowd begin to gather . 
his rage assume a religious form ; that_is , on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness , person become a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of god imprecate doom on person - not_only the cyclist now , but the audience , the world , as_well : `` all you light-headed breed '' . 
this passion bring_on a fit which prove fatal . 
then an ambulance come_along , and they drive person away . 
this be simple enough , but several more point of interest may be mention as relevant . 
the season , between spring and summer , belong_to life in its carefree aspect . 
person 's fatal rage arise not_only because he cannot stop the cyclist , but also because god will not stop him ; as location say to the crowd in his last moment : `` his justice be not of this world '' . 
person is further characterize , in antithesis to person , as animal : the image of a dog , which appear at several place , is first give as the criterion of amiable , irrelevant interest arouse by life consider simply as a spectacle : a dog in a wagon be `` admirable '' , `` a pleasure to contemplate '' ; another wagon have no dog , and therefore be `` devoid_of interest '' . 
person call the cyclist `` cur '' and `` puppy '' among other thing , and at the crisis of his fit a little fox_terrier stand before him and howl into his face . 
the ambulance is draw by two `` charming '' little horse . 
person be not , certainly , religious in any conventional sense . 
his religiousness is intimately , or dialectically , connected with his sinfulness ; the two may in_fact be identical . 
his unsuccessful striving to give_up drink are represent as religious striving ; he keep a bottle in a wardrobe at home , and `` before this wardrobe person had before now go literally on his knee , and in his wrestling had bite his tongue - and still in_the_end capitulate '' . 
the cyclist , by contrast , blond and blue-eyed , be simply unreflective , unproblematic person , `` blithe and carefree '' . 
`` he make no claim to belong_to the great and mighty of this earth '' . 
person be grotesque , a disturbing parody ; his end be ridiculous and trivial . 
he be `` a man raving_mad on_the_way to the churchyard '' . 
but he be more interesting than the others , the ones who come from the highroad to watch him , more interesting than person consider as a cyclist . 
and if i have go into so much detail about so small a work , that is because it be also so typical a work , represent the germinal form of a conflict which remain essential in person 's writing : 
the crude sketch of person contain , in its critical , destructive and self-destructive tendency , much that is enlarge and illuminate in the figure of , for_instance , person and person . 
in method as_well_as in theme this little anecdote with its detail select as much for expressiveness and allegory as for `` realism '' , anticipate a kind of musical_composition , as_well as a kind of fictional composition , in which , as person say , `` there shall be nothing unthematic '' . 
it resemble , too , picture such_as person and person do , in which all that look at_first to be solely pictorial prove on inspection to be also literary , the representation of a proverb , for_example , or a deadly_sin . 
`` gladius_dei '' ( 1902 ) resemble `` the_way_to_the_churchyard '' in its representation of a conflict between light and dark , between `` person '' and a spirit of criticism , negation , melancholy , but it go considerably further in characterize the element of this conflict . 
the monk person , bring over from the renaissance and place against the background of munich at the turn_of_the_century , protest against the luxurious work display in the art shop of person ; in particular against a person portray in a voluptuous style and model , according_to gossip , upon the painter 's mistress . 
person , like person , make his protest quite in_vain , and his rejection , though not fatal , be ridiculous and humiliating ; he is simply throw_out of the shop by the porter . 
on the street outside , person envision a holocaust of the vanity of this world , such a burning of artistic and erotic production as his namesake actually bring to pass in florence , and prophetically he issue his curse : `` gladius_dei super terram cito et velociter '' .

it has recently become practical to use the radio_emission of the moon and planet as a new source of information about these heavenly_body and their atmosphere . 
the result of present observation of the thermal radio_emission of the moon be consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derive from the variation in the infrared_emission during eclipse ( e.g. , person , 1958 ) . 
when sufficiently accurate and complete measurement be available , it will be possible to set limit on the thermal and electrical characteristic of the surface and subsurface material of the moon . 
observation of the radio_emission of a planet which have an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to_a_greater_extent than those use short wavelength and should in some case give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristic of the solid surface . 
radio_observation of venus and jupiter have already supply unexpected experimental data on the physical condition of these planet . 
the observed intensity of the radio_emission of venus be much high than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicate by measurement at wavelength near 3 cm and 10 cm be like that of a blackbody at about 600 ` k . 
this result suggest a very high_temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there be the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non thermal component and that the observed spectrum be that of a blackbody merely by coincidence . 
for the case of jupiter , the radio_emission spectrum be definitely not like the spectrum of a blackbody radiator , and it seem very likely that the radiation reach the earth be a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non thermal component . 
of the remaining planet , only mars and saturn have been observe as radio_source , and not very much information be available . 
mars has been observe twice at about 3 - cm wavelength , and the intensity of the observed radiation be in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predict on the basis of the known temperature of mars . 
the low intensity of the radiation from saturn has limited observation , but again the measured radiation seem to be consistent with a thermal origin . 
no attempt to measure the radio_emission of the remaining planet have been report , and , because of their distance , small diameter , or low_temperature , the thermal radiation at radio wavelength reach the earth from these source is expect to be of very low intensity . 
in_spite of this , the very large radio_reflector and improve amplify technique which are now become available should make it possible to observe the radio_emission of most of the planet in a_few year . 
the study of the radio_emission of the moon and planet begin with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at 1.25 - cm wavelength by person and person ( 1946 ) . 
this was follow by a comprehensive series of observation of the 1.25 - cm emission of the moon over three lunar cycle by person and person ( 1949 ) . 
they deduce from their measurement that the radio_emission from the whole disk of the moon vary during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion ; that the amplitude of the variation be considerably less_than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared_emission as measure by person and person ( 1930 ) and person ( 1935 ) ; and that the maximum of the radio_emission come about 3 - 1 2 day after full_moon , which be again in contrast to the infrared_emission , which reach its maximum at full_moon . 
person and person explain their observation by pointing_out that rocklike material which be likely to make_up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio_wave , although opaque to infrared_radiation . 
the infrared_emission could then be assume to originate at the surface of the moon , while the radio_emission originate at some depth beneath the surface , where the temperature variation due_to solar_radiation is reduce in amplitude and shift in phase . 
since the absorption of radio_wave in rocklike material vary with wavelength , it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depth beneath the surface and possibly detect change in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material . 
the radio_emission of a planet was first detect in 1955 , when person and person ( 1955 ) identify the origin of interference like radio_noise on their record at about 15 meter wavelength as emission from jupiter . 
this sporadic type of planetary radiation is discuss by person ( chap. 13 ) and person ( chap. 14 ) . 
steady radiation which be presumably of thermal origin was observe from venus at 3.15 and 9.4 cm , and from mars and jupiter at 3.15 cm in 1956 ( person , person , and person , 1958 a , b , c ) , and from saturn at 3.75 cm in 1957 ( person and person , 1958 ) . 
in the relatively short time since these early observation , venus has been observe at additional wavelength in the range from 0.8 to 10.2 cm , and jupiter has been observe over the wavelength range from 3.03 to 68 cm . 
the observable characteristic of planetary radio_radiation be the intensity , the polarization , and the direction of arrival of the wave . 
the maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk as observe from the earth be about 1 minute_of_arc . 
this be much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large reflector now under construction , and consequently the radio_emission of different region of the disk cannot be resolve . 
it should be possible , however , to put useful limit on the diameter of the radio_source by observe with large reflector or with interferometer . 
measurement of polarization are presently limit by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth . 
there have be few measurement specifically for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation . 
the measurement make with the nrl 50 - foot reflector , which is altitude azimuth mounted , would have show a systematic change with local hour_angle in the measured intensity of venus and jupiter if a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly polarize . 
recent interferometer measurement ( person and person , 1960 ) have show the 960 - mc emission of jupiter to be partially polarize and to originate_in a region of larger diameter than the visible disk . 
other_than this very significant result , most_of the information now available about the radio_emission of the planet is restrict to the intensity of the radiation . 
the concept of apparent blackbody temperature is use to describe the radiation receive from the moon and the planet . 
the receive radiation is compare with the radiation from a hypothetical blackbody which subtend the same solid_angle as the visible disk of the planet . 
the apparent blackbody disk temperature be the temperature which must be assume for the blackbody in_order_that the intensity of its radiation should equal that of the observed radiation . 
the use of this concept does not specify the origin of the radiation , and only if the planet really radiate as a blackbody , will the apparent blackbody temperature correspond to the physical temperature of the emitting material . 
the radio_radiation of the sun which is reflect from the moon and planet should be negligible compare with their thermal_emission at centimeter wavelength , except possibly at time of exceptional outburst of solar radio_noise . 
the quiescent level of centimeter wavelength solar_radiation would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less than 1 ` k . 
at meter wavelength and increase of the order of 10 ` k in the average disk temperature of the near planet would be expect . 
therefore , neglect the extreme outburst , reflect solar_radiation is not expect to cause sizable error in the measurement of planetary radiation in the centimeter - and decimeter wavelength range . 
radio_observation of the moon have been made over the range of wavelength from 4.3 mm to 75 cm , and the result are summarize in table 1 . 
observation have also been make at 1.5 mm use optical technique ( person , 1955 , 1956 , ; see_also chap. 11 ) . 
not all the observer have use the same procedure or make the same assumption about the lunar brightness distribution when reduce the data , and this , together with difference in the method of calibrate the antenna and receiver , must account_for much of the disagreement in the measured radio_brightness temperature . 
in the observation at 4.3 mm ( person , 1959 a ) , the diameter of the antenna beam , 6 ' .7 , be small enough to allow resolution of some of the larger feature of the lunar surface , and contour diagram have been make of the lunar brightness distribution at three lunar phase . 
these observation indicate that the lunar maria heat_up more rapidly and also cool_off more rapidly than do the mountainous region . 
location seem to be an exception and remain cool than the region which surround it . 
these contour diagram also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio_brightness with latitude . 
very recently , observation have been make at 8 - mm wavelength with a reflector 22 meter in diameter with a resultant beam width of only about 2 ' ( person , person , and person , 1960 ) . 
the constant temperature contour be much smooth than those observe at 4.3 mm by person ( 1959 a ) , and apparently the emission at 8 mm be not nearly so sensitive to difference in surface feature . 
such high-resolution observation as these are needed at several wavelength in_order_that the radio_emission of the moon can be properly interpret . 
the observation of person , person , and person at 3.15 cm and of person at 10.3 cm have not previously been publish and will be briefly describe . 
measurement at 3.15 cm be obtain on 11 day spread over the interval may 3 to june 19 , 1956 , use the 50 - foot reflector at the group in location . 
the half-intensity diameter of the antenna beam be about 9 ' , and the angle subtend by the moon include the entire main beam and part of the first side lobe . 
the antenna pattern and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both measure ( person , person , and person , 1958 b ) , so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid_angle of the moon was know . 
the ratio of the measured antenna temperature_change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam ( assume that the brightness temperature of the sky be negligible ) was find , by graphical integration of the antenna directivity diagram , to be 0.85 . 
the measured brightness temperature be a good approximation to the brightness temperature at the center of the lunar disk because of the narrow antenna beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion of the moon 's disk be nearly uniform . 
the result of the observation be ( in ` k ) **f where the phase angle , |qt , is measure in degree from new_moon and the probable error include absolute as_well_as relative error . 
this result is plot along with the 8.6 - mm observation of person ( 1958 ) in figure 1 , a . 
the variation in the 3 - cm emission of the moon during a lunation be very_much less_than the variation in the 8.6 - mm emission , as would be expect from the explanation of person and person ( 1949 ) . 
in the discussion which follow , the time average of the radio_emission will be refer to as the constant component , and the superimposed periodic variation will be called the variable component . 
the 10.3 - cm observation of person was make on may 20 , 1958 , use the 84 - foot reflector at the group of the group . 
the age of the moon be about 2 day . 
the half-intensity diameter of the main lobe of the antenna be about 18 ' .5 , and the brightness temperature was reduce by assume a gaussian_shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for the moon . 
experiment were make on an electric arc apply a porous graphite anode cool by a transpiring gas ( argon ) . 
thus , the energy transfer from the arc to the anode was partly feed back into the arc . 
it be show that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduce to approximately 15  of the total arc energy a detailed energy balance of the anode was establish . 
the anode ablation could be reduce to a negligible amount . 
the dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirate gas was investigate for various arc length and current between 100 amp and 200 amp . 
qualitative observation were make and high-speed motion_picture were take to study flow phenomenon in the arc at various mass flow velocity . 
the high heat flux exist at the electrode surface of electric arc necessitate extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation . 
the cooling requirement be particularly severe at the anode . 
in free_burning electric arc , for_instance , approximately 90  of the total arc power is transfer to the anode give_rise to local heat flux in excess of **f as measure by the author - the exact value depending_on the arc atmosphere . 
in plasma generator as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high_temperature research tool often more than 50  of the total energy input is being transfer to the cooling medium of the anode . 
the high heat transfer rate at the anode compare with those at the cathode can be explain by the physical_phenomenon occur in free_burning arc . 
in plasma generator the superimposed forced convection may modify the picture somewhat . 
the heat transfer to the anode be_due to the following effect : 1 . 
heat_of_condensation ( work function ) plus kinetic_energy of the electron impinge_on the anode . 
this energy transfer depend_on the current , the temperature in the arc column , the anode material , and the condition in the anode sheath . 
2 . 
heat transfer by molecular conduction as_well_as by radiation from the arc column . 
the heat transfer to the anode in free_burning arc is enhance by a hot gas_jet flow from the cathode towards the anode with velocity up **f . 
this phenomenon has been experimentally investigate in_detail by person ( reference 1 ) . 
the pressure gradient produce the gas_jet be_due to the nature of the magnetic_field in the arc ( rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode ) . 
hence , the flow condition at the anode of free_burning arc resemble those near a stagnation point . 
it be apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirement for the anode of free_burning arc be large compare with those for the cathode . 
the gas flow through a plasma generator will modify these condition ; however , the anode be still the part receive the largest heat flux . 
an attempt to improve the life of the anode or the efficiency of the plasma generator must , therefore , aim at a reduction of the anode loss . 
the following possibility exist for achieve this : 1 . 
the use of high voltage and low current by proper design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given power output . 
2 . 
continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode by flow or magnetic_force . 
3 . 
feedback of the energy transfer to the anode by apply gas transpiration through the anode . 
the third method was , to our knowledge , successfully apply for_the_first_time by person and co-worker ( reference 2 ) . 
the purpose of the present study is to study the thermal condition and to establish an energy balance for a transpiration cooled anode as_well_as the effect of blowing on the arc voltage . 
gas injection through a porous anode ( transpiration cooling ) not_only feed_back the energy transfer to the anode by the above mention process , but also modify the condition in the arc itself . 
a detailed study of this latter phenomenon was not attempt in this paper . 
argon was use as a blowing_gas to exclude any effect of dissociation or chemical_reaction . 
the anode material be porous graphite . 
sintered porous metal should be usable in_principle . 
however , technical difficulty arise by melting at local hot spot . 
the experimental arrangement as describe below be based on the geometry of free_burning arc . 
thus , direct comparison can be draw with free_burning arc which have been study in_detail during the past year and decade by numerous investigator ( reference 3 ) . 
figure 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic view of the test stand and of two different model of the anode holder . 
the cathode consist_of a 1/4 '' diameter thoriated tungsten rod attached to a water-cooled copper tube . 
this tube could be adjust in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the required electrode spacing . 
the anode in figure 2 was mount by means of the anode holder which was attach to a steel plug and disk . 
the transpiring gas eject from the anode form a jet directed axially towards the cathode below . 
inflow of air from the surrounding atmosphere was prevent by the two disk show in figure 2 . 
argon was also blow at low velocity ( mass flow_rate **f ) through a tube coaxial with the cathode as an additional precaution against contamination of the arc by air . 
the anode consist_of a 1/2 inch diameter porous graphite plug , 1/4 inch long . 
the graphite be national_carbon_nc 60 , which have a porosity of 50  and an average pore size of 30 this small pore size was require to ensure uniformity of the flow leave the anode . 
the anode plug ( figure 2 ) was insert into a carbon anode holder . 
a shielded thermocouple was use to measure the upstream temperature of the transpiring gas . 
it was expose to a high velocity gas_jet . 
a plug and a tube with hole in its cylindrical wall divide the chamber above the porous plug into two part . 
this arrangement have the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by natural convection . 
two pyrometer show in figure 1 and 2 ( group model 95 ) serve for simultaneous measurement of the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along the anode holder . 
three thermocouple were place at different location in the aluminum disk surround the anode holder to determine its temperature . 
another anode holder use in the experiment is show in figure 3 . 
in this design the anode holder be water-cooled and the heat loss by conduction from the anode were determine by measure the temperature rise of the coolant . 
to reduce heat transfer from the hot gas to this anode holder outside the region of the arc , a carbon shield was attach to the surface provide an air gap of 1/16 inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder . 
in_addition , the inner surface of the carbon shield was cover with aluminum_foil to reduce radiation . 
temperature of the shield and of the surface of the water-cooled anode holder were measure by thermocouple to account_for heat receive by the coolant but not originate from the anode plug . 
the argon flow from commercial bottle was regulate by a pressure regulator and measure with a gas flow rator . 
the power source be a commercial direct_current rectifier . 
at 100 amp the 360 cycle ripple be less_than 0.5 v ( peak to peak ) with a resistive load . 
the current was regulate by_means_of a variable_resistor and measure with a 50 mv shunt and millivoltmeter . 
the arc voltage was measure with a voltmeter whose terminal were connect to the anode and cathode holder . 
because of the falling characteristic of the rectifier , no ballast_resistor was require for stability of operation . 
a high_frequency starter was use to start the arc . 
the anode holder show in figure 2 was design with two goal in mind . 
the heat loss of the holder were to be reduce as_far_as_possible and they should be such_that an accurate heat balance can be make . 
in_order to reduce the number of variable parameter , all experiment were make with a constant arc length of 0.5 '' and a current of 100 amp . 
the argon flow through the porous anode was vary systematically between **f . 
and **f . 
the lower_limit was determine by the fact that for smaller flow_rate the arc start to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug and that it become highly unstable . 
the upper_limit was determine by the difficulty of measure the characteristic anode surface temperature ( see below ) since only a small region of the anode was strike by the arc . 
this region which have a high temperature than the rest of the anode surface change size and location continuously . 
for each mass flow_rate the arc voltage was measure . 
to measure the surface temperature of the anode plug , the surface was scan with a pyrometer . 
as it turn_out , a very hot region occur on the plug . 
its temperature was denote by **f . 
the size of this hot region was estimate by eye . 
the rest of the surface have a temperature which decrease towards the outer diameter of the plug . 
the mean temperature of this region was approximate by the temperature measure halfway between the edge of the hot spot and the rim of the plug . 
it was denote by **f . 
the mean temperature of the surface was then compute according to the following relation : **f where x be the fraction of the plug area cover by the hot spot . 
assume thermal equilibrium between the anode surface and the transpiring argon , the gas enthalpy rise through the anode was calculate according_to the relation **f whereby the specific_heat of argon was take as **f . 
this calculation result in an enthalpy rise which be somewhat high because it assume a mass flow equally distribute over the plug cross_section whereas in_reality the mass velocity is expect to be smaller in the region of high temperature . 
the upstream gas temperature measure with the thermocouple show in figure 2 be **f . 
the **f value are list in table 1 together with the measured surface temperature and arc voltage . 
simultaneously with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurement pyrometer reading were take along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode holder as indicate on figure 2 . 
some of these temperature are plot in figure 4 . 
they show no marked dependence on the flow_rate within the accuracy of these measurement . 
thus , the dotted line show in figure 4 was take as typical for the temperature distribution for all blowing rate . 
the thermocouple in the aluminum disk show in figure 2 indicate an equilibrium temperature of the surface of **f . 
this temperature was take as environmental temperature to which the anode holder was expose as_far_as radiation is concern . 
it be sufficiently small compare with the surface temperature of the anode holder , to make the energy flux radiate from the environment toward the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurement . 
the reflection of radiation originate from the anode holder and reflect back to it by the surrounding metal surface should also be small because of the specular characteristic of the metal surface and of the specific geometry . 
the total heat loss through the anode holder include also the heat conduct through the base of the cylindrical piece into the adjacent metal part . 
it was calculate from the temperature_gradient **f at **f inch as **f . 
the total heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder be thereby **f the temperature distribution of figure 4 give **f for all blowing rate , assume **f . 
the temperature dependent value of |e was take from reference 7 . 
the radiation loss from the anode surface was compute according_to **f where **f be the mean of the fourth power of the temperature **f and **f calculate analogously to equation ( 1 ) . 
a band viscometer is show in figure 2 . 
it consist_of two block with flat surface hold apart by shim . 
there be a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be test is place . 
a tape of cellulose_acetate is pull between the block and the tape pull the fluid or paste with it between the parallel face of the block . 
in normal use weight are hang_on the end of the tape and allow to pull the tape and the material to be test between the block . 
after it has reach terminal_velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is record . 
by the use of various weight , data for a force rate of shear graph can be obtain . 
the instrument use for this work be a slight modification of that previously describe . 
in this test a * * f tape was pull between the block with a motor and pulley at a rate of * * f with a clearance of 0.002 '' on each side of the tape . 
this give a rate of shear of * * f . 
this , however , can only be consider approximate , as the diameter of the pulley was increase by the buildup of tape and the tape was occasionally remove from the pulley during the run . 
the face of one block contain a hole 1 16 '' in diameter which lead to a manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure . 
although there be only four fluid test , it be apparent that there be two distinct type . 
two of the fluid show a high positive normal pressure when undergo shear , and two show small negative pressure which be negligible in_comparison_with the amount of the positive pressure generate by the other two . 
figure 3 show the data on a silicone fluid , label 12500 cps which give a high positive normal pressure . 
although the tape was run for over 1 hr , a steady state was not reach , and it was conclude that the reason for this be that the back pressure of the manometer was build_up from the material feed from between the block and this be available at a very slow rate . 
a system had_to be use which did not depend_upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurement of the normal pressure were to be make in a reasonable time . 
a back pressure was then introduce , and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicate which be great , the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure . 
by this method it was determine that the normal pressure exert by a sample of polybutene ( molecular_weight report to be 770 ) be over half an atmosphere . 
the actual pressure was not determine because the pressure be beyond the upper_limit of the apparatus on_hand . 
the two fluid which give the small negative pressure be polybutene with molecular_weight which were state to be 520 and 300 . 
these be fluid which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more newtonian because of their lower molecular_weight . 
the maximum suction be 3.25 '' of test fluid measure from the top of the block , and steady state were apparently reach with these fluid . 
it is presume that this negative head be associated with some geometric factor of the assembly , since different reading were obtain with the same fluid and the only apparent difference be the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus . 
this negative pressure is not explain by the velocity head * * f since this be not sufficient to explain the reading by several magnitude . 
these experiment can be consider exploratory only . 
however , they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressure in the presence of flat shear field which were forecast by the theory in the first part of the paper . 
they also give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressure . 
such an instrument would be useful for the characterization of many commercial material as_well_as theoretical study . 
the elasticity as a parameter of fluid which be not subject_to simple measurement at_present , and it be a parameter which is probably vary in an unknown manner with many commercial material . 
such an instrument is expect to be especially useful if it could be use to measure the elasticity of heavy paste such_as printing_ink , paint , adhesive , molten plastic , and bread_dough , for the elasticity is related to those various property term `` length '' , `` shortness '' , `` spinnability '' , etc. , which are usually judge by subjective method at_present . 
the actual change * * f cause by a shear field is calculate by multiply the pressure differential times the volume , just_as_it_is for any gravitational or osmotic_pressure head . 
if the volume be the molal volume , then * * f is obtain on a molal basis which be the customary terminology of the chemist . 
although the * * f calculation be obvious by_analogy_with that for gravitational_field and osmotic_pressure , it be interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalize to include related effect . 
consider a shear field with a height of h and a cross-sectional area of a oppose by a manometer with a height of h ( refer to the same base as h ) and a cross-sectional area of a . 
if * * f be the change per unit volume in person function cause by the shear field at constant p and t , and |r be the density of the fluid , then the total potential_energy of the system above the reference height be * * f . 
* * f be the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to h . 
the total volume of the system above the reference height be * * f , and h can be eliminate to obtain an equation for the total potential_energy of the system in_terms_of h . 
the minimum total potential_energy is find by take the derivative with_respect_to h and equate to zero . 
this give * * f , which be the pressure . 
this be interesting for it combine both the thermodynamic concept of a minimum person function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential_energy for equilibrium . 
this method can be extend to include the concentration difference cause by shear field . 
the relation between osmotic_pressure and the person function may also be develop in an analogous way . 
in the above development we have apply the thermodynamics_of_equilibrium ( refer to by some as thermostatics ) to the steady state . 
this can be justify thermodynamically in this case , and this will be do in a separate paper which is being prepare . 
this have an interesting analogy with the assumption state by person that `` the deformational mechanics of elastic solid can be apply to flowing solution '' . 
there be one exception to the above statement as has been point_out , and that be that fluid can relax by flow into field of lower rate of shear , so the statement should be modify by state that the mechanics be similar . 
if the mechanics be similar , we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar . 
the concept of the strain energy as a person function difference * * f and exert a force normal to the shearing face be compatible with the information obtain from optical birefringence study of fluid undergo shear . 
essentially these birefringence study show that at low rate of shear a tension be present at 45 ` to the direction of shear , and as the rate of shear increase , the direction of the maximum tension move asymptotically toward the direction of shear . 
according_to person , the recoverable shear s is give by * * f where |c be the angle_of_extinction . 
from this and the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic energy of deformation which should be equal to the * * f calculate from the pressure normal to the shearing face . 
there be another means which should show the direction and relative value of the stress in viscoelastic fluid that is not mention as_such in the literature , and that be the shape of the suspended drop of low viscosity fluid in shear field . 
these droplet are distort by the normal force just as a balloon would be pull or press out of shape in one 's hand . 
these droplet appear to be ellipsoid , and it be mathematically convenient to assume that they be . 
if they be not ellipsoid , the conclusion will be a reasonable approximation . 
the direction of the tension of minimum pressure is , of_course , give by the direction of the major_axis of the ellipsoid . 
person and person both show that the major_axis of the ellipsoid be at 45 ` at low rate of shear and that it approach the direction of shear with increased rate of shear . 
( some suspension break_up before they be near to the direction of shear , and some become asymptotic to it without breakup . ) 
this be , of_course , a similar type of behavior to that indicate by birefringence study . 
the relative force can be calculate from the various radius_of_curvature if we assume : ( a ) the surface_tension be uniform on the surface of the drop . 
( b ) that because of the low viscosity of the fluid , the internal pressure be the same in all direction . 
( c ) the kinetic effect be negligible . 
( d ) since the shape of the drop conform_to the force field , it does not appreciably affect the distribution of force in the fluid . 
these be reasonable assumption with low viscosity fluid suspend in high viscosity fluid which are subject to low rate of shear . 
just as the pressure exert by surface_tension in a spherical drop be * * f and the pressure exert by surface_tension on a cylindrical shape be * * f , the pressure exert by any curved surface be * * f , where |g be the interfacial_tension and * * f and * * f be the two radius_of_curvature . 
this formula is give by person and person . 
if a be the major_axis of an ellipsoid and b and c be the other two axis , the radius_of_curvature in the ab plane at the end of the axis be * * f , and the difference in pressure along the a and b axis be * * f . 
there be no data publish in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drop to confirm the above formula . 
however , there be photograph of suspend drop of cyclohexanol_phthalate ( viscosity 155 poise ) suspend in corn_syrup of 71 poise in a paper by person and person . 
this viscosity of the material in the drop be , of_course , not negligible . 
measurement on the photograph in this paper give * * f at the maximum rate of shear of * * f . 
if it is assume that the formula give by person of * * f , cosecant 2lc apply , the pressure difference along the major_axis can be calculate from the angle of inclination of the major_axis , and from this the interfacial_tension can be calculate . 
its value be * * f from the above data . 
this appear to be high , as would be expect from the appreciable viscosity of the material in the drop . 
it be appropriate to call_attention_to certain thermodynamic property of an ideal_gas that be analogous to rubberlike deformation . 
the internal energy of an ideal_gas depend_on temperature only and be independent of pressure or volume . 
in_other_words , if an ideal_gas is compress and keep at constant temperature , the work do in compress it is completely convert into heat and transfer to the surrounding heat_sink . 
this mean that work equal q which in_turn equal * * f . 
there be a well-known relationship between probability and entropy which state that * * f , where \q be the probability that state ( i.e. , volume for an ideal_gas ) could be reach by chance alone . 
this is known as conformational_entropy . 
this conformational_entropy be , in this case , equal to the usual entropy , for there be no other change or other energy involve . 
note that though the ideal_gas itself contain no additional energy , the compressed gas does exert an increased pressure . 
the energy for any isothermal work do by the perfect_gas must come as thermal energy from its surroundings . 
a proton_magnetic_resonance study of polycrystalline **f as a function of magnetic_field and temperature is present . 
**f be paramagnetic , and electron paramagnetic dipole as_well_as nuclear dipole effect lead to line broadening . 
the line be asymmetric and over the range of field **f gauss and temperature **f the asymmetry increase with increasing **f and decreasing t . 
an isotropic resonance shift of **f to lower applied field indicate a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction . 
the general theory of resonance shift is use to derive a general expression for the second_moment **f of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialize to **f . 
the theory predict a linear dependence of **f on **f , where |j be the experimentally determine person constant . 
the experimental second_moment **f conform_to the relation **f in_agreement with theory . 
hence , the electron paramagnetic effect ( slope ) can be separate from the nuclear effect ( intercept ) . 
the paramagnetic dipole effect provide some information on the particle shape . 
the nuclear dipole effect provide some information on the motion of the hydrogen nucleus , but the symmetry of the **f bond in **f remain in doubt . 
the magnetic_moment of an unpaired electron associate nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic_resonance property of nucleus . 
it be important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since quantitative nuclear_resonance is become increasingly use in investigation of structure . 
**f appear to be well suited for the study of these matter , since it be a normal paramagnet , with three unpaired electron on the chromium , its crystal structure be very simple , and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong **f bond provide structural interest . 
we first discuss the **f bond in **f . 
we then outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipole with nucleus and show that the theory be in excellent agreement with experiment . 
indeed it be possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effect . 
the information provide by the electron paramagnetic effect is then discuss , and finally the nuclear effect are interpret in_terms_of various motional modified model of the **f bond in **f . 
theoretical study of the hydrogen_bond generally agree that the **f bond will be linear in the absence of peculiarity of packing in the solid . 
moreover , it will be asymmetric until a certain critical **f distance is reach , below which it will become symmetric . 
there be ample evidence from many source that the **f bond in **f be symmetric . 
the **f distance in **f be 2.26 a . 
there be evidence , though less convincing than for **f , that the **f bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime be symmetric . 
here the **f distance be 2.44 a . 
a number of semiempirical estimate by various worker lead to the conclusion that the **f bond become symmetric when the **f bond length be about 2.4 to 2.5 a , but aside from the possible example of nickel dimethylglyoxime there have be no convincing report of symmetric **f bond . 
person has study the crystal structure of **f by x-ray_diffraction . 
he find the structure contain an **f bond with the **f distance of **f . 
there be , then , the possibility that this **f bond be symmetric , although person be unable to determine its symmetry from his x_ray data . 
person find **f to be trigonal , person symmetry **f , with **f , **f . 
x_ray and experimental density show one formula unit in the unit_cell , correspond to a paramagnetic ion density of **f . 
the x_ray data did not permit person to determine uniquely the space group , but a negative test for piezoelectricity lead him to assume a center of symmetry . 
under this assumption the space group must be **f and the following be the position of the atom in the unit_cell . 
**f . 
this space group require the hydrogen_bond to be symmetric . 
person find powder intensity calculation and measurement to agree best for **f . 
these data lead to a structure in which sheet of cr atom lie between two sheet of o atom . 
the o atom in each sheet be close-packed and each cr atom is surround by a distorted octahedron of o atom . 
the **f layer are stack normal to the [ 111 ] axis with the lower oxygen of one layer directly above the upper oxygen of the neighboring lower layer , in such a manner that the repeat be every three layer . 
the separate layer are join together by hydrogen_bond . 
a drawing of the structure is to be_found in reference 6 . 
the gross detail of the structure appear reasonable . 
the structure appear to be unique among rooh compound , but be the same as that assume by **f . 
the bond angle and distance be all within the expected limit and the volume per oxygen be about normal . 
however , the possible absence of a center of symmetry not_only move the hydrogen_atom off **f , but also allow the oxygen atom to become nonequivalent , with **f at **f and **f at **f ( space group **f ) , where **f represent the oxygen on one side of the **f layer and **f those on the other side . 
however , any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely short **f interlayer distance of 2.55 a or the non hydrogen_bond **f interlayer interaction which be already quite short at 2.58 a . 
hence it be difficult to conceive_of a packing of the atom in this material in which the oxygen atom be far from geometrical equivalence . 
the only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen_atom to occupy general , rather_than special , position along the [ 111 ] axis . 
if the **f bond be linear then there be three reasonable position for the hydrogen_atom : ( 1 ) the hydrogen_atom be centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the oxygen sheet ; ( 2 ) all hydrogen_atom lie on a sheet , but the sheet be close to one oxygen sheet than to the other ; ( 3 ) hydrogen_atom be asymmetrically place , either randomly or in an ordered way , so that some hydrogen_atom be close to the upper oxygen atom while others be close to the lower oxygen atom . 
position ( 2 ) appear to us to be unlikely in_view_of the absence of a piezoelectric_effect and on general chemical structural grounds . 
a randomization of `` ups '' and `` downs '' be more likely than ordered `` ups '' and `` downs '' in position ( 3 ) since the hydrogen_atom are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another , and also since ordered `` up '' and `` down '' imply a larger unit_cell , for which no evidence exist . 
therefore , the only unknown structural feature would appear to be whether the hydrogen_atom be located symmetrically ( 1 ) or asymmetrically ( 3 ) . 
person prepare his sample of **f by thermal decomposition of aqueous chromic_acid at 300 - 325 ` c . 
person be kind enough to lend us about 5 gram of his material . 
this material prove to be unsatisfactory , since we could not obtain reproducible result on various portion of the sample . 
subsequently , we learn from person that his sample contain a_few percent **f impurity . 
since **f be ferromagnetic , we feel that any result obtain from the magnetically contaminate **f would be suspect . 
person suggest another preparation of **f which we use here . 
500 ml of 1 m aqueous **f with 1 g **f add are heat in a bomb at 170 ` c for 48 hour . 
a very fine , gray solid ( about 15 g ) is form , water-wash by centrifugation , and dry at 110 ` c . 
differential thermal analysis show a very small endothermic_reaction at 340 ` c and a large endothermic_reaction at 470 ` c . 
this latter reaction be in_accord with the reported decomposition of **f . 
thermogravimetric analysis show a weight loss of 1.8  centered at 337 ` c and another weight loss of 10.8  at 463 ` c . 
the expected weight loss for **f go_to **f and **f be 10.6  . 
mass-spectrometric analysis of gas evolve upon heat to 410 ` c indicate nitrogen_oxide and water_vapor . 
the small reaction occur at 337 ` c is probably cause by decomposition of occluded nitrate , and perhaps by a small amount of some hydrous material other_than **f . 
all subsequent measurement were make on material which had been heat to 375 ` c for one hour . 
emission_spectrum indicate **f calcium and all other impurity much lower . 
chromium analysis give 58.8  cr as compare with 61.2  theory . 
however , **f adsorb water from the atmosphere and this may account_for the low chromium analysis and high total weight loss . 
the x-ray_diffraction pattern of the material , take with cukla radiation , indicate the presence of no extra line and be in good agreement with the pattern of person . 
magnetic analysis by person of this laboratory indicate no ferromagnetic impurity . 
**f was find to be paramagnetic with three unpaired electron per chromium atom and a molecular susceptibility of **f , where **f . 
for exactly three unpaired electron the coefficient would be 3.10 . 
an infrared_spectrum , obtain by person and person of this laboratory , show band in the position find by person . 
electron_microscopic examination of the **f sample show it to be composed of nearly isotropic particle about 0.3 lm in diameter . 
the particle appear rough and undoubtedly the single crystal domain be smaller than this . 
the x_ray data be consistent with particle size of 1000 a or great . 
we find no obvious effect due_to preferred orientation of the crystallite in this sample nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape find from electron_microscopic examination . 
the magnetic_resonance absorption was detect by employ a varian model **f broad line spectrometer and the associated 12 - inch electromagnet system . 
one measurement at 40 mc / sec was obtain with the varian model **f unit . 
a bridged-t type of bridge was use in the 10 - 16 mc / sec range . 
the rf power level was maintain small enough at all time to prevent obvious line shape distortion by saturation effect . 
a modulation frequency of 40 cps with an amplitude as small as possible , commensurate with reasonably good signal-to-noise quality , was use . 
background spectrum were obtain in all case . 
the spectrometer was adjust to minimize the amount of dispersion mode mix_in with the absorption signal . 
a single value of the thermal relaxation_time **f at room_temperature was measure by the progressive saturation method . 
the value of **f estimate at 470 gauss be **f microsecond . 
a single measurement of the spin spin relaxation_time **f was obtain at 10 mc / sec by pulse method . 
this measurement was obtain by person of the group , by observe the breadth of the free induction decay signal . 
the value derive be 16 microsecond . 
field shift were derive from the mean value of the resonance line , define as the field about which the first_moment be zero . 
second_moment of the spectrum were compute by numerical integration . 
correction were apply for modulation broaden , apparatus background , and field shift . 
spectrum were obtain over the temperature range of 77 - 294 ` k . 
for the low_temperature measurement the sample was cool by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of person and person . 
the temperature was maintain to within about **f for the period_of_time require to make the measurement ( usually about one hour ) . 
one sample , which had been expose to the atmosphere after evacuation at 375 ` c , show the presence of adsorbed water ( about 0.3 wt  ) as evidence by a weak resonance line which be very narrow at room_temperature and which disappear , due_to broadening , at low_temperature . 
the data report here be either from spectrum from which the adsorbed water resonance could easily be eliminate or from spectrum of sample evacuate and sealed_off at 375 ` c which contain no adsorbed water . 
the measured powder density of the **f use here be about **f , approximately one-third that of the crystal density ( **f ) . 
such a density correspond to a paramagnetic ion density of about **f . 
spectrum were obtain from a powdered sample have the shape of a right circular cylinder with a height to diameter ratio of 4 : 1 . 
the top of the sample be nearly flat and the bottom hemispherical . 
spectrum were also obtain from a sample in a spherical container which was make by blow a bubble on the end of a capillary glass tube . 
the bubble was fill to the top and special precaution were taken to prevent any sample from remain in the capillary . 
spectrum were also obtain from a third sample of **f which had been dilute to three_times its original volume with powdered , anhydrous alundum ( **f ) . 
this sample was contain in a cylindrical container similar to that describe above . 
polyphosphate give renewed life to soap product at a time when surfactant be a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphate spell the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphate and synthetic detergent active was recognize and exploit . 
the market today for detergent_builder be quite diverse . 
the best-known field of application for builder be in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulation for household use . 
these widely advertised product , which are use primarily for wash clothes , be based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic active ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonate ) and contain up_to 50  by weight of sodium_tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium_tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium_pyrophosphate . 
in the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulation based on nonionic active with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; light-duty synthetic detergent with much less builder ; and the dwindling built soap_powder as_well_as soap_flakes and granule , none of which are now nationally advertise . 
a well publicized entrant which has achieve success only recently be the built liquid_detergent , with which the major problem today be incorporation of builder and active into a small volume use a sufficiently high builder / active ratio . 
hard surface cleaning in household application is represent by two class of alkaline product : ( 1 ) the formulation make expressly for machine dishwasher , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaner use for wall and woodwork . 
the better quality product in both of these line contain phosphate builder . 
in_addition , many of the hard surface cleaner use for wall and woodwork have their genesis in trisodium_orthophosphate , which be still the major ingredient of a number of such product . 
many scouring powder now also contain phosphate . 
these hard surface cleaner are discuss in chapter twenty-eighth . 
cleaning or detergent action be entirely a matter of surface . 
wet cleaning involve an aqueous medium , a solid substrate , soil to be remove , and the detergent or surface-active material . 
an oversimplified differentiation between soft - and hard surface cleaning lie_in the magnitude and kind of surface involve . 
one gram of cotton has been find to have a specific surface_area of * * f . 
in contrast , a metal coupon * * f in size would have a magnitude from 100000 to a_million less . 
even here there is room for some variation , for metal surface vary in smoothness , absorptive capacity , and chemical reactivity . 
person use a person surface analyzer in a metal cleaning study and show considerable difference in soil removal , depend_upon surface roughness . 
there are considerable difference between the requirement for textile and hard surface cleaning . 
exclusive of esthetic value , such_as high - or low foam level , perfume content , etc. , the requirement for the organic active use in washing textile be high . 
no matter how they are formulate , a large_number of organic active be simply not suitable for this application , since they do not give adequate soil removal . 
this is best demonstrate by practical washing test in which cloth article are repeatedly wash with the same detergent formulation . 
a good formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many washing ; whereas , with a poor formulation , the clothes exhibit a buildup of `` tattletale_grey '' and dirty spot - sometimes with bad result even after the first wash . 
since practical washing procedure be both lengthy and expensive , a number of laboratory test have been develop for the numerical evaluation of detergent . 
person has indicate that two device , the launder-ometer and terg-o-tometer are most widely use for rapid detergent testing , and he has list the commercially available standard soiled fabric . 
also give are several laboratory wash procedure in general use . 
the soiled fabric use for rapid testing of detergent formulation are make in such a way that only part of the soil is remove by even the best detergent formulation in a single wash . 
in this way , numerical value for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulation can be obtain by measure the reflectance ( whiteness ) of the cloth swatch before and after washing . 
soil redeposition is evaluate by wash clean swatch with the dirty ones . 
as_is the case with the surface-active_agent , the requirement for builder to be use in detergent composition for washing textile be also high . 
large_number of potential builder have been investigate , but none have been find to be as effective as the polyphosphate over the relatively wide range of condition meet in_practice . 
the problem of hard surface cleaning be not nearly as complex . 
in hard surface cleaning , the inorganic salt be more important than the organic active . 
indeed , when the proper inorganic constituent are employ , practically any wetting or surface-active_agent will do a reasonably good job when present in sufficient amount in a hard surface cleaning formulation . 
hydroxide , orthophosphate , borate , carbonate , and silicate be important inorganic ingredient of hard surface cleaner . 
in_addition , the polyphosphate are also use , probably act_as more as peptizing agent than anything else . 
the importance of the inorganic constituent in hard surface cleaning has been emphasize in a number of papers . 
although there is no question but that the process of washing fabric involve a number of phenomenon which are relate together in an extremely complicated way and that these phenomenon and their interrelation are not well understand at the present , this section attempt to present briefly an up-to-date picture of the physical_chemistry of washing either fabric or hard surface . 
the purpose of washing be , obviously , to remove soil which are arbitrarily class in the four major category give below : 
dirt , which is here define as particulate material which be usually inorganic and be very often extremely finely divide so as to exhibit colloidal property . 
greasy soil , which are typify by hydrocarbon and fat ( ester of glycerol with long chain organic acid ) . 
stain , which include the wide variety of nonparticulate material which give color even when present in very low concentration on the soiled object . 
miscellaneous soil , which primarily include sticky substance and colorless liquid which evaporate to leave a residue . 
the dirt on the soiled object is mechanically hold by surface irregularity to some extent . 
however , a major factor in bind dirt be the attraction between surface that goes_under_the_name_of van_der_waal's_forces . 
this be a theoretically complicated dipole interaction which cause any extremely small uncharged particle to agglomerate with other small uncharged particle , or to stick_to an uncharged surface . 
obviously , if colloidal particle bear charge of opposite sign or , if one kind be charged and the other kind be not , the attraction will be intensify and the tendency to agglomerate will be greatly reinforce . 
likewise , a charged particle will tend to stick_to an uncharged surface and vice_versa , and a charged particle will be very strongly attract to a surface exhibit an opposite charge . 
in_addition , dirt particle can be hold onto a soiled surface by sticky substance or by the surface_tension of liquid , include liquid grease . 
grease , stain , and miscellaneous soil are usually sorb onto the soiled surface . 
in most case , these soil are take_up as liquid through capillary_action . 
in an essentially static system , an oil cannot be replace by water on a surface unless the interfacial_tension of the water phase are reduce by a surface-active_agent . 
the washing process whereby soil are remove consist basically of apply mechanical action to loosen the dirt particle and dried matter in the presence of water which help to float off the debris and act_as , to some extent , as a dissolving_agent and solvating_agent agent . 
greasy soil are hardly remove by washing in plain water ; and natural water , in_addition , often contain impurity such_as calcium salt which can react with soil to make them more difficult to remove . 
therefore , detergent are use . 
the detergent active be that substance which primarily act to remove greasy soil . 
the other constituent in a built detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty stain and the hydrophilic sticky or dried soil . 
as_is well_known , detergent active belong_to the chemical class consist_of moderately high molecular_weight and highly polar molecule which exhibit the property of form micelle in solution . 
physicochemical investigation of anionic surfactant , include the soap , have show that there be little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anion below a certain region of concentration called the critical micelle concentration . 
( 1 ) below the critical micelle concentration , monomer and some dimer be present . 
( 2 ) in the critical micelle region , there be a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelle , which have a degree of polymerization average around 60 - 80 . 
( 3 ) for anionic , these micelle appear to be roughly spherical assemblage in which the hydrocarbon tail come together so that the polar group ( the ionized end ) face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase . 
obviously hydrophobic ( oleophilic ) substance such_as grease , oil , or particle have a greasy or oily surface be more at_home in the center of a micelle than in the aqueous phase . 
micelle can imbibe and hold a considerable amount of oleophilic substance so that the micelle volume may be increase as_much_as approximately twofold . 
although the matter has not been unequivocally demonstrate , the available data show that micelle in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process . 
related_to micelle formation be the technologically important ability of detergent active to congregate at oil-water_interface in such a manner that the polar ( or ionized ) end of the molecule is direct towards the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards the oily phase . 
in the cleaning process , sorbed greasy soil become coated in this manner with an oriented film of surfactant . 
then during washing , the greasy soil roll back at the edge so that emulsified droplet can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass , with the aid of mechanical action , and enter the aqueous phase . 
obviously , a substance which is permanently or temporarily sorb on the surface in_place_of the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off the greasy soil . 
substance other_than detergent active also tend to be strongly sorb from aqueous medium onto surface of other contiguous condensed phase . 
this be particularly true of highly charged ion , especially those ion which fall_into the class of polyelectrolyte . 
whereas the usual organic surface-active_agent is strongly sorb at oil-water_interface , the highly charged ion are most strongly sorb at interface between water and insoluble material exhibit an ionic structure ( see table 26 - 2 on page 1678 ) . 
thus , for aqueous medium , we can think_of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic or hydrophobic surface-active_agent , and of an idealized builder as a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active_agent . 
from the equilibrium sorption data which be available , it seem logical to expect that polyphosphate ion would be strongly sorb on the surface of the dirt ( especially clay soil ) so as to give it a greatly increased negative_charge . 
the charged particle then repel each other and are also repel from the charged surface , which almost invariably bear a negative_charge under washing condition . 
the negatively_charged dirt particle then leave the surface and go_into the aqueous phase . 
this hypothesis is evolve in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic active in detergency . 
it does not consider the kinetic effect of the phosphate builder on sorption desorption phenomenon which will be discuss later ( see page 1746 - 1748 ) . 
the crude picture of the detergency process thus_far develop can be represent as : * * f the influence of mechanical action on the particle of free soil may be compare to that of kinetic_energy on a molecular scale . 
freed soil must be disperse and protect against flocculation . 
cleaned cloth must be protect against the redeposition of dispersed soil . 
it be evident that the requirement impose by these effect upon any one detergent constituent act alone be severe . 
upon consideration of the variety of soil and fabric normally encounter in the washing process , it be little wonder that the use of a number of detergent constituent have `` synergistic '' property has gain widespread acceptance . 
in the overall process , it be difficult to assign a `` pure '' role to each constituent of a built detergent formulation ; and , indeed , there is no_more reason to separate the interrelated role of the active , builder , antiredeposition agent , etc. than there is to assign individual action to each of the numerous isomer make_up a given commercial organic active . 
the thermal exchange of chlorine between * * f and liquid * * f be readily measurable at temperature in the range of 180 ` and above . 
the photochemical_exchange occur with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at 65 ` use light absorb only by the * * f . 
in the gas phase , with * * f of * * f and * * f of * * f , quantum yield of the order of * * f have been observe at 85 ` . 
despite extensive attempt to obtain highly pure reagent , serious difficulty was experience in obtain reproducible rate of reaction . 
it appear possible to set a lower_limit of about * * f for the activation_energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon_tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form * * f radical . 
the rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appear to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicate that the radical intermediate are remove at the wall or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reaction . 
because of the simplicity of the molecule , isotopic exchange reaction between elemental halogen and the corresponding carbon_tetrahalide would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibility for obtain unambiguous basic kinetic data . 
it would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanism for the thermal and photochemical_reaction in both the liquid and gas phase and to determine value for activation_energy of some of the intermediate reaction of atom and free_radical , as_well_as information on the heat_of_dissociation of the carbon halogen bond . 
the reaction of chlorine with carbon_tetrachloride seem particularly suited for such study . 
it should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chloride on a vacuum system follow by multiple distillation of the liquid . 
it should be possible to free carbon_tetrachloride of any interfering substance by the usual purification method follow by prechlorination prior to addition of radioactive chlorine . 
furthermore , the exchange would not be expect to be sensitive to trace amount of impurity because it would not be apt to be a chain_reaction since the activation_energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expect to be too high ; also it would be expect that * * f would compete very effectively with any impurity as a scavenger for * * f radical . 
contrary to these expectation we have find it impossible to obtain the degree of reproducibility one would wish , even with extensive effort to prepare especially pure reagent . 
we are report these investigation here briefly because of their relevancy to problem of the study of apparently simple exchange reaction of chlorine and because the result furnish some information on the activation_energy for abstraction of chlorine atom from carbon_tetrachloride . 
person highest purity tank chlorine was pass through a tube of resublimed * * f into an evacuated pyrex system where it was condense with liquid_air . 
it was then distill at_least three time from a trap at_- 78 ` to a liquid_air trap with only a small middle fraction being retain in each distillation . 
the purified product was store at_- 78 ` in a tube equip with a break_seal . 
of several method employ for tag chlorine with radiochlorine , the exchange of inactive chlorine with tagged aluminum_chloride at room_temperature was find to be the most satisfactory . 
to prepare the latter , silver_chloride was precipitate from a solution contain * * f obtain from the group . 
the silver_chloride was fuse under vacuum in the presence of aluminum chip with the resultant product of * * f which was sublime into a flask on the vacuum line . 
previously purified chlorine was subsequently admit and the exchange was allow to take_place . 
the radiochlorine was store at_- 78 ` in a tube equip with a break_seal . 
liter quantity of mallinckrodt , low sulfur , reagent grade carbon_tetrachloride were saturate with * * f and * * f and illuminate for about 50 hour with a 1000 watt tungsten lamp at a distance of a_few inch . 
the mixture was then extract with alkali and with water following which the carbon_tetrachloride was distill on a person column , a 25  center cut being retain which was then degas under vacuum in the presence of * * f . 
purified inactive chlorine was then add from one of the tube describe above and the mixture freeze_out and seal_off in a flask equip with a break_seal . 
this chlorine carbon_tetrachloride solution was illuminate for a day following which the flask was reseal onto a vacuum system and the excess chlorine distill off . 
the required amount of carbon_tetrachloride was distill into a series of reaction cell on a manifold on a vacuum line . 
the desired amount of inactive chlorine and radioactive chlorine were likewise condense in these cell on the vacuum line following which they were freeze_down and the manifold as_a_whole was seal_off . 
the content of the manifold for liquid phase experiment were then mix by shaking , redistribute to the reaction tube , freeze_down , and each tube was then sealed_off . 
the reactant for the gas phase experiment were first freeze_out in a side arm attach to the manifold and then allow to distill slowly into the manifold of precooled reaction cell before seal_off . 
this method in_general solve the problem of obtain fairly equal concentration of reactant in each of the six cell from a set . 
the sample for liquid phase thermal reaction study were prepare in pyrex capillary_tubing 2.5 mm i.d. and about 15 cm long . 
in a_few experiment the tube were make from standard 6 mm i.d. pyrex tubing of 1 mm wall thickness . 
both type of tube withstand the pressure of approximately 20 atmosphere exert by the carbon_tetrachloride at 220 ` . 
the photochemical_reaction cell consist_of 10 mm i.d. pyrex tubing , 5.5 cm long , diffraction effect being minimize by the fact that the light pass_through only liquid glass interface and not gas glass interface . 
these cell were use rather than square pyrex tubing because of the tendency of the latter to shatter when thaw frozen carbon_tetrachloride . 
the round cell were reproducibly position in the light_beam which enter the thermostated mineral_oil bath through a window . 
two type of light source were use , a thousand watt projection lamp and an ah6 high pressure mercury arc . 
the light was filter by the soft_glass window of the thermostat thus ensure that only light absorb by the chlorine and not by the carbon_tetrachloride could enter the reaction cell . 
relative incident light intensity were measure with a thermopile potentiometer system . 
change of intensity on the cell were achieve by use of a wire screen and by vary the distance of the light source from the cell . 
follow reaction the cell were scratch with a file and open under a 20  aqueous sodium_iodide solution . 
carrier * * f was add and the aqueous and organic phase were separate ( cell contain gaseous reactant were immerse in liquid_air before open under sodium_iodide ) . 
after titration of the liberated * * f with * * f , aliquot of the aqueous and of the organic phase were count in a solution type geiger_tube . 
in the liquid phase run the amount of carbon_tetrachloride in each reaction tube was determine by weigh the tube before open and weigh the fragment after empty . 
the fraction of exchange was determine as the ratio of the count / minute observe in the carbon_tetrachloride to the count / minute calculate for the carbon_tetrachloride fraction for equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon_tetrachloride , empirically determine correction being make for the difference in counting efficiency of * * f in * * f and * * f . 
in study the liquid phase thermal reaction , some 70 tube from 12 different manifold filling were prepare and analyze . 
experiment were do at 180 , 200 , 210 , 220 ` . 
follow observation of the fact that the reaction rate of supposedly identical reaction mixture prepare on the same filling manifold and expose under identical condition often differ by several hundred percent , a systematic series of experiment was undertake to see whether the difficulty could be ascribe to the method of prepare the chlorine , to the effect of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tube . 
in_addition to the method describe in the section above , chlorine and radiochlorine were prepare by the electrolysis of a * * f eutectic on the vacuum line , and by exchange of * * f with molten * * f . 
calcium_hydride was substitute for * * f as a drying_agent for carbon_tetrachloride . 
no correlation between these variable and the irreproducibility of the result was find . 
the reaction rate observe at 200 ` range from * * f of the chlorine exchange per hour to 0.7 exchange per hour . 
in most case the chlorine concentration be about * * f . 
set of reaction tube contain 0.2 of an atmosphere of added oxygen in one case and added moisture in another , both give reaction rate in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 of the chlorine exchange per hour . 
no detectable reaction was find at room_temperature for reaction mixture allow to stand up_to 5 hour . 
the liquid phase photochemical_exchange between chlorine and carbon_tetrachloride be more reproducible than the thermal exchange , although still erratic . 
the improvement be most noticeable in the great consistency among reaction cell prepare as_a_group on the same manifold . 
rather large difference were still find between reaction cell from different manifold filling . 
some 80 reaction tube from 13 manifold filling were illuminate in the temperature range from 40 to 85 ` in a further endeavor to determine the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on the activation_energy and the effect of light intensity . 
in all case there be readily measurable exchange after as little as one hour of illumination . 
by compare reaction cell seal from the same manifold temperature dependency corresponding to activation_energy range from 11 to 18 * * f was observe while dependence on the first power of the light intensity seem to be indicate in most case . 
it be possible to make estimate of the quantum yield by observe the extent of reduction of a uranyl_oxalate actinometer solution illuminate for a known time in a typical reaction cell and make appropriate conversion base on the difference in the absorption_spectrum of uranyl_oxalate and of chlorine , and consider the spectral distribution of the light source . 
these estimate indicate that the quantum yield for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon_tetrachloride at 65 ` be of the order_of_magnitude of unity . 
when typical reaction cell to which 0.3 of an atmosphere of oxygen had been add were illuminate , chlorine and phosgene were produce . 
exchange was also observe in these cell , which have chlorine present at * * f . 
although there be some variation in result which must be attribute either to trace impurity or to variation in wall effect , the photochemical_exchange in the gas phase be sufficiently reproducible so that it seem meaningful to compare the reaction rate in different series of reaction tube for the purpose of obtain information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon_tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate . 
data on such comparison together with data on the effect of light intensity are give in table /1 . 
. 
in series /1 , the relative light intensity was vary by vary the distance of the lamp from the reaction cell over the range from 14.7 to 29.2 cm . 
the last column show the rate of exchange that would have been observe at a relative intensity of 4 ( 14.7 cm distance ) calculate on the assumption that the incident light intensity be inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate be directly proportional to the incident light intensity . 
direct proportionality of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assume in obtain the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series /2 , where the light intensity was reduce by use of a screen . 
the person effect ( person , 1937 ; person and person , 1950 ) , which be a retardation of the orbital motion of particle by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive_force of the impinging solar_radiation , cause the dust to spiral into the sun in time much short than the age of the earth . 
the radial velocity vary inversely as the particle size - a 1000 - | m diameter particle near the orbit of mars would reach the sun in about 60 million year . 
person ( 1955 ) extend the effect to include the solar_radiation corpuscular_radiation pressure , which increase both the minimum particle size and the drag . 
further , the corpuscular_radiation , i.e. , the solar_wind proton , must sputter away the surface atom of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the person effect and the ratio of the repulsive_force to the gravitational_force . 
the person effect cause the semi major_axis of orbit to diminish more rapidly than the semiminor_axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbit as the particle move toward the sun . 
also , planetary gravitational_attraction increase the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approach . 
at one astronomical_unit from the sun ( the earth 's distance ) the dust orbit be probably nearly circular . 
if such be the case , the particle within a distance of about * * f km of the earth will have , relative to the earth , a kinetic_energy less than their potential_energy and they will be capture into orbit about the earth . 
person ( 1955 ) has calculate the time require for these particle to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the person effect , which in this case cause the orbit to become more_and_more eccentric without change the semi major_axis . 
this effect can give_rise to a blanket of micrometeorite around the earth . 
since there be a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in space because of the radiation effect , there must be a continual replenishment : otherwise , micrometeorite would have disappear from interplanetary_space . 
there are several possible source . 
according_to person ( 1955 ) , cometary debris be sufficient to replenish the material spiral into the sun , maintain a fairly steady state . 
asteroidal collision are also think to contribute material . 
it be also possible that some of the dust in the vicinity of the earth originate from meteoritic impact upon the moon . 
one cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite flux in space . 
even in the neighborhood of the earth , where information has been obtain both directly and indirectly , the derived flux value vary by at_least four order_of_magnitude . 
this large discrepancy demonstrate the inadequacy of the experimental method and the lack of understanding of the various phenomenon involved . 
beyond a_few million kilometer from the earth , but still in the region of the earth 's orbit , a prediction of the flux of dust be even more unreliable . 
at great distance from the sun , the situation be still less certain . 
there are several source of evidence on the micrometeorite environment . 
direct information has been obtain from rocket and satellite equip with impact sensor . 
in_addition , the size distribution obtain from visual and radar observation of meteor may be extrapolate to the micrometeorite domain . 
from the brightness of the f component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal_light , an estimate of the particle size , concentration , and spatial distribution can be derive for region of space near the ecliptic plane . 
another important source of evidence only recently receive much attention be the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic component . 
the core of deep sea sediment and content of collector in remote region be valuable in this category . 
the data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the earth . 
the direct_evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the earth is obtain from piezoelectric sensor ( essentially microphone ) and from wire gage ; these instrument are install on rocket , satellite , and space_probe . 
statistically , the most significant data have been collect from the sensor on 1958 alpha ( explorer_1 , ) , 1958 delta_2 ( sputnik 3 , ) , and 1959 eta ( vanguard 3 , ) . 
these vehicle , with large sensitive area , have collect data for long enough time to give reliable impact rate for the period of exposure . 
many other vehicle with smaller sensitive area exposure time product contribute some information . 
the impact rate on 1958 alpha for 153 event be * * f for particle of mass great than * * f ( person , 1960 ) ; this mass threshold was derive from the detector calibration and an assumed impact velocity of * * f . 
the data show daily_variation and diurnal_variation . 
ninety percent of the 153 record impact occur between midnight and noon , and from day to day the variation of the rate be as much as an order_of_magnitude . 
one may conclude that most_of the detected micrometeoritic material be concentrated in orbital stream which intersect the earth 's orbit . 
there have been contradictory report from 1958 delta_2 , and the data quote here are believe to be the more reliable . 
on may 15 , a very large increase occur with * * f of mass between * * f and * * f ; for the next two day , the impact rate be * * f ; and for the next nine day , the impact rate be less_than * * f ( person , 1960 ) . 
the data for the first day indicate a meteor_stream with a very high concentration of particle and may have lead to the high estimate of micrometeorite flux . 
preliminary data from 1959_eta give an average impact rate of * * f for mass larger than * * f for about 1000 event in a 22 - day period ( person and person , 1960 ) . 
the day-to-day rate vary by less_than a factor of 4.5 . 
the data have not_yet been analyze for diurnal_variation . 
note that the mass threshold be four_times that of 1958_alpha and that the flux be one-fifth as large . 
if one assume that the average flux did not change between measurement , a mass distribution curve is obtain which relate the flux of particle larger than a given radius to the inverse 7 2 power of the radius . 
space_probe have yield little information . 
pioneer_1 , record a decrease in flux with distance from the earth on the basis of 11 count in 9 hour . 
with detector sensitive to three mass interval and base on a_few count , the second and third russian space_probe indicate that the flux of the smallest particle detect be less_than that of larger ones . 
be based on so few event , these result be of dubious validity . 
the calibration of piezoelectric sensor in_terms_of the particle parameter be very uncertain . 
many worker believe that the response be proportional to the incident momentum of the particle , a relation deduce from laboratory result linearly extrapolate to meteoritic velocity . 
however , one must expect that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity impact would cause a deviation from a linear relationship . 
in the united_states , most_of the sensor are calibrate by drop small sphere on their sensitive surface . 
the russian experimenter claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensor is cause by the incident momentum with the remainder be momentum of eject material from the sensor . 
this `` ejection '' momentum be linearly related to the particle energy . 
they quote about the same mass threshold as that of the u.s. apparatus , but a momentum threshold about 40 times great . 
there is a difference in the experimental arrangement , in_that the u.s. microphone are attach directly to the vehicle skin while the russian instrument are isolate from the skin . 
the threshold mass is derive from the momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of * * f in the u.s. work and * * f in the ussr work . 
the threshold mass of about * * f correspond to a 10 - | m diameter sphere of density * * f . 
however , the conversion from mass to size be unreliable , since many photographic meteor give evidence of a fluffy , loosely bound meteorite structure with density as low as * * f . 
to_what_extent such low_density apply to micrometeorite be unknown . 
the velocity value use be also open_to some question ; if a substantial fraction of the dust is orbit about the earth , only about one-third the above-mentioned average velocity should be use in derive the mass . 
zodiacal_light and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust blanket , a phenomenon also to be expect if the dust before capture be in circular orbit about the sun , as indicate by the trend of the smaller visible meteor . 
the diurnal_variation in the observed flux may be partly due_to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident velocity . 
the flux of micrometeorite in the neighborhood of the earth can be estimate by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data . 
a summary of meteorite data , prepare by person ( 1958 ) on the basis of photographic , visual , and radar evidence , is give in table 5 - 1 . 
from an estimated mass of 25 g for a zero magnitude meteorite , the other mass are derive with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each unit increase in magnitude . 
the radius is calculate from the mass by assume sphere of density * * f except for the smallest particle , which must have a high mass density to remain in the solar_system in the presence of solar_radiation pressure . 
the flux value be for all particle with mass great than the given mass and be based on an estimate of the number of visual meteor . 
it is assume that the flux value increase by a factor of 2.512 per magnitude , in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude be constant . 
the value agree with the data from 1958_alpha and 1959_eta . 
the figure in the next-to-last column are derive with the assumption of 50 percent shielding by the earth ; hence , these figure apply immediately above the earth 's atmosphere . 
the unshielded flux is give in the last column ; these figure constitute the best estimate for the flux in interplanetary_space near the earth . 
of_course , if there be a dust blanket around the earth , the flux in interplanetary_space should be less_than the figure give here . 
note that the mass scale be one to two order_of_magnitude great than some previously use ; for_example , person ( 1948 ) derive a scale of 0.15 g for a * * f , zero magnitude meteorite . 
the old scale be based on theoretical estimate of the conversion efficiency of kinetic_energy into light . 
the mass scale use in table 5 - 1 was derive on the assumption that the motion of the glowing trail is related_to the momentum transfer to the trail by the meteorite , permit the calculation of the mass if the velocity is know ( person and person , 1958 ) . 
a concentration distribution has been derive from radar observation sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude ( person and person , 1959 ) . 
extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude cover the range of micrometeorite . 
the approximate equation be * * f , where n be the number of * * f with electron line density great than or equal to * * f , and q be proportional to the mass of the meteorite . 
therefore , n be inversely proportional to the radius cube and in fair agreement with the inverse 7 2 power derive from 1958_alpha and 1959_eta data . 
at the fifteenth magnitude , * * f , and at the twenty-fifth magnitude , * * f . 
these extrapolated flux be about an order_of_magnitude less_than the value from the satellite data and the figure in person 's table . 
the extrapolation may be in error for several reason . 
the observational data determine the concentration distribution have a range of error which is magnify in the extension into the micrometeorite region . 
the solar electromagnetic - and corpuscular-radiation_pressure and the associated person effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size decrease and modify the distribution and limit size to larger than a_few micron . 
also , it has been suggest that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorite ( person , 1960 ) , and the same distribution would not be expect . 
a measure of the total mass accretion of meteoritic material by the earth is obtain from analysis of deep sea sediment and dust collect in remote region ( person , 1960 ) . 
most meteoritic material , by the time it reach the earth's_surface , has been reduce to dust or to spherule of ablated material in its passage through the atmosphere . 
for all meteorite , the average nickel content be about 2.5 percent . 
this be much high than the nickel content of terrestrial dust and sediment and provide a basis for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx . 
present data indicate an accretion of about * * f ton per_year over the entire globe , or about * * f . 
biological_warfare be the intentional use of living microorganism or their toxic product for the purpose of destroy or reduce the military effectiveness of man . 
it be the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious_disease agent by scientific research and development , result in the production of bw weapons_system . 
man may also be injure secondarily by damage to his food crop or domestic_animal . 
biological_warfare is consider to be primarily a strategic weapon . 
the major reason for this be that it have no quick kill effect . 
the incubation_period of infectious_disease , plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect , render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter . 
a man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation_period of most infectious_disease . 
thus , an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population center such_as large city . 
an important operational procedure in bw for an enemy would be to create an aerosol or cloud of agent over the target_area . 
this concept has stimulate much basic research concern the behavior of particulate biological material , the pathogenesis of respiratory infection , the medical management of such disease and defense against their occurrence . 
the biological and physical_property of infectious particle have been study intensively during the past fifteen year . 
much new equipment and many unique technique have been develop for the quantitative exposure of experimental animal to aerosol of infectious agent contain in particle of specified dimensional characteristic . 
much information has been gather relative to quantitative sampling and assessment technique . 
much of the old experimental work on respiratory infection was accomplish by very artificial procedure . 
the intra nasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an anesthetized animal be far different from exposure , through natural respiration , to aerosolized organism . 
the importance of particle size in such aerosol has be thoroughly demonstrate . 
the natural anatomical and physiological defensive feature of the upper respiratory_tract , such_as the turbinate of the nose and the cilium of the trachea and larger bronchus , be capable of impinging out the larger particle to which we be ordinarily exposed in our daily existence . 
very small particle , however , in a size range of 1 to 4 micron in diameter be capable of pass these impinging barrier and enter the alveolar_bed of the lung . 
this area be highly susceptible to infection . 
the entrance and retention of infectious particle in the alveolus amount almost to an intra tissue inoculation . 
the relationship between particle size and infectious dose is illustrate in table 1 . 
in consider bw defense , it must be recognize that a number of critical meteorological parameter must be meet for an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect . 
for_example , bright sunlight be rapidly destructive for living microorganism suspend in air . 
there be optimal humidity requirement for various agent when airborne . 
neutral or inversion meteorological_conditions be necessary for a cloud to travel_along the surface . 
it will rise during lapse condition . 
there be , of_course , certain time during the 24 - hour daily cycle when most_of these condition will be meet . 
certain other property of small particle , in_addition_to those already mention in_connection_with penetration of the respiratory_tract , be noteworthy in defense consideration . 
the smaller the particle the further it will travel downwind before settle out . 
an aerosol of such small particle . 
moreover , diffuse through structure in much the same manner as a gas . 
there may be a number of secondary effect result from diffusion through building such_as widespread contamination of kitchen , restaurant , food store , hospital , etc. . 
depending_on the organism , there may be multiplication in some food or beverage product , i.e. , in milk for_example . 
the secondary consequence from this could be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for defense . 
something of the behavior of cloud of small particle can be illustrate by the following field_trial : 
in the first trial an inert substance was disseminate from a boat travel some ten mile off shore under appropriately select meteorological_conditions . 
zinc_cadmium_sulfide in particle of 2 micron in size were disseminate . 
this material fluoresce under ultraviolet_light which facilitate its sampling and assessment . 
four_hundred and fifty pound was disseminate while the ship was travel a distance of 156 mile . 
figure 1 describe the result obtain in this trial . 
the particle travel a maximum detected distance of some 450 mile . 
from these dosage isopleth it can be see that an area of over 34000 square_mile was cover . 
these dosage could have been increase by increase the source strength which be small in this case . 
the behavior of a biological aerosol , on a much smaller scale , is illustrate by a specific field_trial conduct with a non pathogenic organism . 
an aqueous suspension of the spore of b subtilis , var. niger , generally known as bacillus_globigii , was aerosolize use commercially available nozzle . 
a satisfactory cloud was produce even_though these nozzle be only about 5 percent efficient in produce an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 micron . 
in this test , 130 gallon of a suspension , have a count of * * f organism per ml , or a total of approximately * * f spore , was aerosolize . 
the spraying operation was conduct from the rear deck of a small naval vessel , cruise two mile offshore and vertical to an onshore breeze . 
spraying continue along a two mile course . 
this operation was start at 5 : 00 pm and last for 29 minute . 
there be a slight lapse condition , a moderate fog , and 100 percent relative_humidity . 
a network of sampling_station had been set_up on shore . 
these be located at the home of government employee , in government_office , building and reservation within the trial area . 
a rough attempt was make to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by take sample from outside the window on the first , ninth , and fifteenth floor of a government_office building . 
all sampler were operate for a period of two hour except one , which was operate for four hour . 
in this instance , there be a dosage of 562 during the first two hour and a total dosage of 1980 for the four hour period , a fourfold increase . 
this suggest that the sampling period , particularly at the more distant location , should have been increase . 
as can be see from figure 2 , an extensive area was cover by this aerosol . 
the maximum distance sample be 23 mile from the source . 
as can be see from these dosage isopleth , approximately 100 square_mile was cover within the area sample . 
it be quite likely that an even greater area was cover , particularly downwind . 
the dosage in the three level of the vertical profile be : * * f this be not , of_course , enough sample to give a satisfactory description of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol . 
a number of unique medical problem might be create when man is expose to an infectious agent through the respiratory route rather_than by the natural portal of entry . 
some agent have been show to be much more toxic or infectious to experimental animal when exposed to aerosol of optimum particle size than by the natural portal . 
botulinal toxin , for_example , be several thousand-fold more toxic by this route than when give per os . 
in some instance a different clinical disease picture may result from this route of exposure , make diagnosis difficult . 
in tularemia produce by aerosol exposure , one would not expect to find the classical ulcer of `` rabbit_fever '' on a finger . 
an enemy would obviously choose an agent that is believe to be highly infectious . 
agent that are know to cause frequent infection among laboratory worker such_as those cause q_fever , tularemia , brucellosis , glanders , coccidioidomycosis , etc. , belong in this category . 
an agent would likely be select which would possess sufficient viability and virulence stability to meet realistic minimal logistic requirement . 
it be , obviously , a proper goal of research to improve on this property . 
in this connection it should be capable of being disseminate without excessive destruction . 
moreover , it should not be so fastidious in its growth requirement as to make production on a militarily significant scale improbable . 
an aggressor would use an agent against which there be a minimal naturally acquire or artificially induce immunity in a target population . 
a solid immunity be the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralize . 
it must be remember , however , that there be many agent for which there be no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be break by an appropriate dose of agent . 
there be a broad spectrum of organism from which selection for a specified military purpose might be make . 
an enemy might choose an acutely debilitating microorganism , a chronic disease producer or one cause a high rate of lethality . 
it be possible that certain mutational form may be produce such_as antibiotic resistant strain . 
mutant may also be develop with change in biochemical property that be of importance in identification . 
all_of these consideration be of critical importance in consider defense and medical management . 
biological agent be , of_course , highly host specific . 
they do not destroy physical_structure as be true of high_explosive . 
this may be of overriding importance in consider military objective . 
the question of epidemic disease merit some discussion . 
only a limited effort has been devote to this problem . 
some of those who question the value of bw have assume that the only potential would be in the establishment of epidemic . 
they then point_out that with our present lack of knowledge of all the factor concerned in the rise and fall of epidemic , it be unlikely that a planned episode could be initiate . 
they argue further ( and somewhat contradictorily ) that our knowledge and resource in preventive_medicine would make it possible to control such an outbreak of disease . 
this be why this approach to bw defense has not been give major attention . 
our major problem be what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target . 
this , of_course , does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose agent that are associate naturally with epidemic disease . 
a hypothetical example will illustrate this point . 
let us assume that it would be possible for an enemy to create an aerosol of the causative agent of epidemic typhus ( rickettsia_prowazwki ) over city a and that a large_number of case of typhus_fever result therefrom . 
no epidemic was initiate nor was one expect because the population in city a be not lousy . 
lousiness be a prerequisite for epidemic typhus . 
in this case , then , the military objective was accomplish with an epidemic agent solely through the result secure in the initial attack . 
this was done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic . 
on_the_other_hand , a similar attack might have been make on location whose population was know to be lousy . 
one might expect some spread of the disease in this case result in increased effectiveness of the attack . 
the major defensive problem are concerned with the possibility of overt military delivery of biological agent from appropriate disseminating device . 
it should be no_more difficult to deliver such device than other weapon . 
the same delivery vehicle - whether they be airplane , submarine or guided_missile - should be usable . 
if it be possible for an enemy to put an atomic_bomb on a city , it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent over that city . 
biological agent be , moreover , suitable for delivery through enemy sabotage which impose many problem in defense . 
a_few obvious target_area of great importance might be mention . 
the air-conditioning and ventilating_system of large building be subject_to attack . 
america is rapidly become a nation that use processed , precooked and even predigested food . 
this be an enormous industry that is subject_to sabotage . 
one must include the preparation of soft_drink and the processing of milk and milk product . 
huge industry be involved also in the production of biological product , drug and cosmetics which be liable to this type of attack . 
a variety of technique have been direct toward the isolation and study of blood_group antibody . 
these include low_temperature ethanol ( person ) fractionation , electrophoresis , ultracentrifugation and column_chromatography on ion_exchange cellulose . 
modification of the last technique have been apply by several group of investigator . 
person and person , use a stepwise elution scheme , fractionate whole serum contain abo_antibodies and rh_antibody on diethylaminoethyl_cellulose deae_cellulose and carboxymethyl_cellulose . 
person and co-worker , in a similar study of blood_group antibody of whole serum , use a series of gradient for elution from deae_cellulose . 
person and person use a single , continuous gradient at constant ph for the fractionation of anti - a and anti - b agglutinin from preisolate | gamma_globulin sample . 
in the present work whole serum have been fractionate by chromatography on deae_cellulose use single gradient similar to those describe by person and person , and certain chemical and serological property of the fraction contain antibody of the abo and rh system have been describe . 
serum sample were obtain from normal group a , group b and group o donor . 
three of the anti - rh serum use were take from recently sensitize individual . 
one contain complete antibody and have a titer of 1 : 512 in saline . 
the second contain incomplete antibody and show titer of 1 : 256 in albumin and 1 : 2048 by the indirect_coombs_test . 
the third , contain the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibody , have titer of 1 : 256 in saline , 1 : 512 in albumin and 1 : 1024 by the indirect_coombs_test . 
in_addition one serum was obtain from a donor ( person . ) who had been sensitize 6 year previously . 
this serum exhibit titer of 1 : 16 in albumin and 1 : 256 by the indirect_coombs_test . 
these antibody titer were determine by reaction with homozygous * * f red_blood_cell . 
anti - a and anti - b activity were determine in fraction from the serum of group a , group b or group o donor by the following tube agglutination method . 
one drop of each sample was add to one drop of a 2  suspension of group * * f or group b red_blood_cell in a small * * f test_tube . 
in several instance group o cell were also use as control . 
the red_blood_cell be use within 2 day after donation and were wash with large amount of saline before use . 
the mixture of sample plus cell suspension were allow to stand at room_temperature for 1 hr . 
the tube were then centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examine macroscopically for agglutination . 
for the albumin method , equal volume of 30  bovine albumin , sample and 2  cell suspend in saline were allow to stand at room_temperature for 1 hr and then were centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 1 min . 
all sample were test by both the saline and albumin method . 
the activity of fraction of serum contain rh_antibody were test by the saline , albumin and indirect_coombs technique . 
homozygous and heterozygous * * f cell , * * f and homozygous and heterozygous * * f cell were use to test each sample ; however , in the interest of clarity and conciseness only the result obtain with homozygous * * f and homozygous * * f cell will be present here . 
the saline and albumin test were perform as describe for the abo sample except that the mixture was incubate for 1 hr at 37 ` c before centrifugation . 
the saline tube were save and use for the indirect_coombs_test in the following manner . 
the cell were wash three time with saline , anti human serum was add , the cell were resuspend , and the mixture was centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examine for agglutination . 
the anti human serum use were prepare by inject whole human serum into rabbit . 
those antiserum show by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the `` broad spectrum '' type were select for use in the present study . 
the red_blood_cell for the rh_antibody test were use within 3 day after draw except for the * * f cell , which had been glycerolize and store at - 20 ` c for approximately 1 year . 
these cell were thaw at 37 ` c for 30 min and were deglycerolize by alternately centrifuge and mix with descend concentration of glycerol solution ( 20 , 18 , 10 , 8 , 4 and 2  ) . 
the cell were then wash three time with saline and resuspend to 2  in saline . 
blood sample were allow to clot at room_temperature for 3 hr , centrifuge and the serum was remove . 
the serum was measure volumetrically and subsequently dialyze in the cold for at_least 24 hr against three to four change , approximately 750 ml each , of `` starting_buffer '' . 
this buffer , ph 8.6 , be 0.005 m in * * f and 0.039 m in tris ( hydroxymethyl ) - aminomethane ( tris ) . 
after dialysis the sample was centrifuge and the supernatant place on a * * f cm column of deae_cellulose equilibrate with starting_buffer . 
the deae_cellulose , contain 0.78 meq of n / g , was prepare in our laboratory by the method of person and person ( 7 ) from powdered cellulose , 100 - 230 mesh . 
the small amount of insoluble material which precipitate during dialysis was suspend in approximately 5 ml of starting_buffer , centrifuge , resuspend in 25 ml of isotonic saline and test for antibody activity . 
the chromatography was do at 6 ` c use gradient elution , essentially according_to person and person . 
the deep concave gradient employ ( fig 2 ) was obtain with a nine chambered gradient elution device ( `` varigrad '' , reference ( 8 ) ) and has been describe elsewhere . 
the other , a shallow concave gradient ( fig 1 ) , was produce with a so-called `` cone sphere '' apparatus , the `` cone '' be a 2 - liter erlenmeyer_flask and the `` sphere , '' a 2 - liter round-bottom flask . 
each initially contain 1700 ml of buffer ; in the sphere be start buffer and in the cone be final buffer , 0.50 m in both * * f and tris , ph 4.1 . 
a flow_rate of 72 * * f was use and 12 ml fraction were collect . 
approximately 165 fraction were obtain from each column . 
these were read at 280 m | m in a beckman model du spectrophotometer and test for antibody activity as describe above . 
for protein identification , fraction from the column were concentrate by pervaporation against a stream of air at 5 ` c or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permit simultaneous concentration of the protein and dialysis against isotonic saline . 
during the latter procedure the temperature was maintain at 2 ` c by surround the apparatus with ice . 
because negative pressure dialysis give better recovery of protein , permit detection of protein concentrated from very dilute solution and be a gentle procedure , it be use in all but the early experiment . 
paper_electrophoresis was carry_out on the concentrated sample in a spinco model r cell use barbital buffer , ph 8.6 , ionic strength 0.075 , at room_temperature on whatman 3 mm filter_paper . 
five milliampere / cell were apply for 18 hr , after which the strip were stain with bromophenol_blue and densitometry was carry_out use a spinco_analytrol . 
when paper_electrophoresis was to be use for preparation , eight strip of a whole serum sample or a chromatographic fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were run / chamber under the condition describe above . 
at the end of the run , the strip in the third and sixth position in each chamber were dry , stain for 1 hr , wash and dry , while the other strip were maintain in a horizontal position at 1 ` c . 
the unstained strip were then mark , use the stained ones as a guide , and cut transversely so as to separate the various protein band . 
the strip section contain a given protein were pool , elute with 0.5 ml of isotonic saline , and the eluate were test for antibody activity . 
fraction from the column which were to be subject to analytical ultracentrifugation were concentrate by negative pressure dialysis and dialyze for 16 hr in the cold against at_least 500 volume of phosphate buffer saline , ph 7.2 , ionic strength 0.154 . 
they were then centrifuge at 59780 rpm for 35 to 80 min at 20 ` c in a spinco model e ultracentrifuge at a protein concentration of 1.00 to 1.25  . 
sedimentation coefficient were compute as * * f value and relative amount of the various component were calculate from the schlieren pattern . 
for preparative ultracentrifugation , fraction from the column were concentrate by negative pressure dialysis to volume of 1 ml or less , transfer to cellulose tube and dilute to 12 ml with isotonic saline . 
ultracentrifugation was then carry_out in a spinco model l ultracentrifuge at 40000 rpm for 125 to 150 min , refrigeration being use throughout the run . 
successive 1 - ml fraction were then draw off with a hypodermic_syringe , start at the top of the tube , and test for agglutinin activity . 
other method will be describe below . 
the insoluble material which precipitate during dialysis against starting_buffer always show intense agglutinin activity , regardless of the blood_group of the donor . 
with either of the gradient describe , chromatography on deae_cellulose separate agglutinin of the abo series into at_least three region ( fig 1 and 2 ) : 
one of extremely low anionic binding capacity , one of low anionic bind capacity and one of high anionic bind capacity . 
these have been label region 1 , 2 , and 4 , respectively , in fig 1 . 
when the early part of the gradient was flatten , either by use the gradient show in fig 2 or by allow the `` cone sphere '' gradient to become established more slowly , region 2 activity could sometimes be separate into two area ( donor person and person , fig 1 and person , fig 2 ) . 
the latter procedure give_rise to a small active protein peak ( region 1a ) between region 1 and 2 . 
in 2 of 15 experiment on whole serum a region of agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic bind capacity was detect ( region 3 , fig 1 ) . 
moreover , after concentration use negative pressure dialysis , agglutinin activity could sometimes be detect in the region designate 2a ( donor person , person , and person , fig 1 ) . 
not all these region exhibit equal agglutinating_activity , as evidence by titer and the extent of the active area . 
in all case , most of the activity lie_in the region of high anionic bind capacity . 
this be particularly noticeable in group a and group b serum , in which case activity in region 1 and 2 be usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally could not be detect at_all . 
there appear to be no difference in the distribution of anti - a and anti - b activity in group o serum , though in two group o donor ( person and e._m. ) only one type of agglutinin was find in the region of low anionic bind capacity ( fig 1 and 2 ) . 
several sample of citrate plasma were fractionate in our laboratory by method 6 of person et_al. . 
these fraction were test for abo agglutinin activity , use fraction from group ab plasma as a control . 
as_expected , most of the activity was find in fraction * * f , with slight activity see in fraction 4 , - 1 . 
a sample of fraction * * f from group o plasma was dissolve in starting_buffer , dialyze against this buffer and subject to chromatography use the gradient show in fig 2 . 
once_again , both anti - a and anti - b activity were find in the insoluble material precipitate during dialysis . 
similarly , both type of antibody were find in three region of the chromatographic eluate , have extremely low , low , and high anionic bind capacity , respectively ( fig 3 ) . 
chromatography of whole serum reveal that the area of rh_antibody activity be generally continuous and wide . 
the incomplete antibody activity appear in the early part of the chromatogram ; the complete , in the latter part . 
the serum contain the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibody show activity in both region ( fig 1 ) . 
in all case the activity against * * f cell was spread over a wide area than that with * * f cell , regardless of the type of test ( saline , albumin , indirect_coombs ) use for comparison . 
the insoluble material result from dialysis against starting_buffer always show strong activity . 
in_fact agglutination of * * f cell in saline could be produce by the insoluble material from serum contain `` only '' incomplete antibody activity . 
this was later know to be the result of concentrate the minute amount of complete antibody find in these serum ; when the insoluble fraction was suspend in a volume of saline equal_to that of the original serum sample , no complete antibody activity could be detect . 
apart from the honeybee , practically all bee and bumblebee hibernate in a state of torpor . 
occasionally , you may come_across one or two bumblebee in the cold season , when you are turn_over sod in your garden , but you have_to be a really keen observer to see them at_all . 
they keep their wing and foot press tightly against their body , and in_spite_of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lump of dirt . 
i must add at_once that these animal be what we call `` queen '' , young female that have mate in the previous summer or autumn . 
it be on them alone that the future of their race depend_on , for all their relative ( mother , husband , brother , and unmated sister ) have perish with the arrival of the cold_weather . 
even some of the queen will die before the winter be over , fall prey to enemy or disease . 
the survivor emerge on some nice , sunny day in march or april , when the temperature be close to 50 ` f and there be not too_much wind . 
now the thing for us to do be to find ourselves a_couple_of those wonderful flowering currant such_as the red ribes_sanguineum of our location , or otherwise a good sloe tree , or perhaps some nice pussy_willow in bloom , preferably one with male or staminate catkin . 
the bloom of ribes and of the willow and sloe be the place where large_number of our early insect will assemble : honeybee , bumblebee , and other wild bee , and also various kind of fly . 
it be a happy , buzzing crowd . 
each male willow catkin be composed of a large_number of small flower . 
it be not difficult to see that the stamen of the catkin are always arrange in pair , and that each individual flower be nothing but one such pair stand on a green , black tip little scale . 
by scrutinize the flower , one can also notice that the scale bear one or two tiny wart . 
those be the nectary or honey gland ( fig 26 , page 74 ) . 
the staminate willow catkin , then , provide their visitor with both nectar and pollen ; a marvelous arrangement , for it provide exactly what the bee queen need to make their beebread , a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are feed . 
the only exception to this be certain bee that have become parasite . 
i will deal with these later_on . 
quite often , honeybee form a majority on the willow catkin . 
as we have already see in the first chapter , bumblebee be big , hairy , and much more colorful than honeybee , exhibit various combination of black , yellow , white and orange . 
let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game , and let us just call them bombus ; there must be several dozen species in the united_states alone . 
if you really insist on know their name , an excellent book on the north-american species be bumblebee and their way by person . 
if we manage to keep track of a bombus queen after she has leave her feeding place , we may discover the snug little hideout which she has fix_up for herself when she wake_up from her winter sleep . 
as befit a queen , a bumblebee female be rather choosy and may spend considerable time search for a suitable nesting_place . 
most species seem to prefer a ready-made hollow such_as a deserted mouse_nest , a birdhouse , or the hole make by a woodpecker ; some show a definite liking for make their nest in moss . 
once she has make_up_one's_mind , the queen start_out by construct , in her chosen abode , a small `` floor '' of dried grass or some woolly material . 
on this , she build an `` egg compartment '' or `` egg cell '' which is filled with that famous pollen and nectar mixture called beebread . 
she also build one or two waxen cup which she fill with honey . 
then , a group of egg is deposit in a cavity in the beebread loaf and the egg compartment is close . 
the queen afterward keep incubate and guard her egg like a mother hen , take a sip from_time_to_time from the rather liquid honey in her honey pot . 
when the larva hatch , they feed_on the beebread , although they also receive extra honey meal from their mother . 
she continue to add to the pollen supply as_needed . 
the larva , keep warm by the queen , be full-grown in about ten day . 
each now make a tough , papery cocoon and pupate . 
after another two_weeks , the first young emerge , four to eight small daughter that begin to play the role of worker_bee , collect pollen and nectar in the field and care for the new young generation while the queen retire to a life of egg_laying . 
the first worker_bee do not mate or lay egg ; male and mating female do not emerge until later in the season . 
the brood of worker that appear later tend to be bigger than the first ones , probably because they are better feed . 
by the middle of the summer , many_of the larva apparently receive such a good diet that it be `` optimal '' , and it is then that young queen begin to appear . 
simultaneously , male or drone are produce , mostly from the unfertilized egg of worker , although a few may be produce by the queen . 
the young queen and drone leave the nest and mate , and after a short period of freedom , the fertilized young queen will begin to dig in for the winter . 
it be an amazing fact that in some species this will happen while the summer be still in_full_swing , for_instance , in august . 
the temperature then be still very high . 
at the old nest , the queen will in the early fall cease to lay the fertilized egg that will produce female . 
as a result , the proportion of male ( which leave the nest ) increase , and eventually the old colony will die_out completely . 
the nest itself , the structure that in some case house about 2000 individual when the season be at its peak , is now rapidly destroy by the scavenging larva of certain beetle and moth . 
not always , though , does the development of a bumblebee colony take_place in the smooth fashion we have just describe . 
some member of the bee family have become idler , social parasite that live at the expense of their hardworking relative . 
bumblebee can thus suffer severely from the onslaught of psithyrus , the `` cuckoo-bumblebee '' as it is called in some european_country . 
female individual of psithyrus look deceptively like the worker and queen of the bumblebee they victimize . 
the one sure way to tell_apart victim and villain apart be to examine the hind_leg which in the case of the idler , psithyrus , lack the pollen basket - naturally ! 
the female parasite spend much time in her effort to find a nest of her host . 
when she succeed , she usually manage to slip_in unobtrusively , to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the bumblebee seal the egg compartment . 
the host never seem to recognize that something be amiss , so that the compartment afterward is seal normally . 
thus , the larva of the intruder can develop at the expense of the rightful inhabitant and the store of beebread . 
later_on , they and the mother psithyrus are feed by the bombus worker . 
worse still , in a number of case it has be claim that the psithyrus female kill_off the bombus queen . 
but let us return , after this gruesome interlude , to our willow catkin in the spring ; there be other wild bee that command our attention . 
it be almost certain that some of these , usually a_trifle smaller than the honeybee , be andrenas or mining_bee . 
there be about 200 different kind of andrena in europe alone . 
one of my favorite be a._armata , a species very common in england , where it is sometimes refer to as the lawn bee . 
the female like to burrow in the short turf of well-kept lawn , where their little mound of earth often appear by the hundred . 
almost equal in size to a honeybee . 
a._armata be much more beautiful in color , at_least in the female of the species : a rich , velvety , rusty red . 
the male be much dull . 
after having mate , an andrena female dig a hole straight down into the ground , form a burrow about the size of a lead_pencil . 
the bottom part of a burrow have a number of side tunnel or `` cell '' , each of which is provide with an egg plus a store of beebread . 
the development of the andrena larva be very rapid , so that by the end of spring they have already pupate and become adult . 
but they are still enclose in their larval cell and remain there throughout the summer , fall , and winter . 
their appearance , next spring , coincide in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plant . 
in the sacramento valley in california , for_instance , it has be observe that there be not one day 's difference between the emergence of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkin . 
this must be_due to a completely identical response to the weather , in the plant and the animal . 
after the male and female andrenas have mate , the cycle is repeat . 
although andrena be gregarious , so that we may find hundred and hundred of burrow together , we must still call it a solitary bee . 
its life_history be much simple than that of the truly colonial bumblebee and can serve as an example of the life_cycle of many other species . 
after_all , social life in the group of the bee be by_no_means general , although it certainly be a striking feature . 
on the basis of its life_history , we like to think that andrena be more primitive than the bumblebee . 
the way in which it transport its pollen be not so perfect , either . 
it lack pollen basket and possess only a large_number of long , branched hair on its leg , on which the pollen grain will collect . 
still andrena will do a reasonably good job , so that an animal with a full pollen load look_like a gay little piece of yellow down float in the wind . 
closely related to the andrena be the nomia or alkali_bee . 
nomia_melanderi can be find in tremendous number in certain part of the united_states west of the location , for_example , in utah and central washington . 
in the united_states department_of_agriculture 's yearbook_of_agriculture , 1952 , which is devote entirely to insect , person mention a site in utah which was estimate to contain 200000 nest female . 
often the burrow be only an inch or two apart , and the bee city cover several acres . 
the life_history of the alkali_bee be similar to that of andrena , but the first activity of the adult does not take_place until summer , and the individual hibernate in the prepupal stage . 
in most place , there be two generation a year , a second brood of adult appear late in the summer . 
i must plead guilty to a special sympathy for nomia . 
this may just be pride in my adopted location , but certainly i love to visit their mound city near location and location in july or august , when the bee be in their most active period . 
the name `` alkali_bee '' indicate that one has_to look_for them in rather inhospitable place . 
sometimes , although by_no_means always , these be indeed alkaline . 
the thing be that these bee love a fine-grained soil that be moist ; yet the water in the ground should not be stagnant either . 
they dislike dense vegetation . 
where does one find such condition ? 
the best chance , of_course , is offer by gently sloping terrain where the water remain close to the surface and where the air be dry , so that a high evaporation leave salty deposit which permit only sparse plant growth . 
many other ( probably nearly all ) snake at maturity be already more_than half their final length . 
person put length at maturity at two third the ultimate length for some rattlesnake , and person 's data on location garter_snake and ribbon_snake ( thamnophis ) show that the smallest gravid female be more_than half as long as the biggest adult . 
person state that `` when the snake reach its maturity it has already reach about its maximal length '' , but go_on to cite the reticulate python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three_times that at maturity . 
it be hard to understand how he conclude that most snake do not grow appreciably after attain maturity ; he was work with species of location , so perhaps some tropical snake be unusual in this respect . 
certain individual giant record later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it be impossible to know whether this be_due to captive condition . 
additional record of slow growth have been omit . 
it be possible to make a_few generalization about the six giant themselves . 
there seem to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate length , start with the smallest ( boa_constrictor ) and end with the largest ( anaconda ) . 
data on the former be scanty , but there can be little doubt that the latter be_born sometimes be_born at a length greater than that of any of the others , thereby lend support to the belief that the anaconda does , indeed , attain the greatest length . 
for four of the six ( the anaconda and the amethystine_python cannot be include for lack of data ) there be also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length , the boa_constrictor be the smallest and the indian_python the next in size at the former stage . 
let us speculate a_little on the maximum size of the anaconda . 
if , in a certain part of the range , it start life 1 foot long than do any of the other ( relatively large ) giant , and reach maturity at , let us guess , 18 inch long than the others , a quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of ( nearly ) 40 foot . 
when it come_to rate of early growth , the indian_python lead with a figure of about 3 foot 6 inch per_year for the first two year , more_or_less . 
the african rock_python , a close second , is follow in_turn by the reticulate python . 
there be few data on the boa_constrictor , those for the anaconda be unconvincing , and there be nothing at_all on the amethystine_python . 
it seem likely that the indian_python come_out ahead because record of its growth have been make more carefully and frequently ; it respond exceptionally well to captivity and does not reach proportion that make it hard to keep . 
i cannot make sense out of the figure for post maturity growth ; at_best the annual increase appear to be a matter of inch rather_than foot . 
until better record have been keep over long period_of_time and much more is know about the maximum dimension , it will be wise to refrain_from draw conclusion . 
it is often state that the largest snake require five year to attain maturity , but this apparently be an overestimation . 
the best way to determine the correct figure ( in captive ) be by direct observation of pair isolate from birth , a method that produce surprising result : maturing of a male indian_python in less_than two year , his mate in less_than three ; data on the boa_constrictor about match this . 
another approach be to estimate from the rate_of_growth and the smallest size at maturity . 
result from this approach amply confirm the direct observation : 
about three year be required , there be a possible slight difference between male and female in the time require . 
only the amethystine_python and the anaconda must be exclude for lack or paucity of data . 
the following information on snake vary greatly in size ( but all with less_than a 10 - foot maximum ) show , when consider with the foregoing , that there be probably no correlation between the length of a snake and the time require for it to mature . 
person , in his summary of the habit of the snake of the united_states , could supply data on the maturing period for only three species in_addition_to the rattler , which i shall consider separately . 
these three be much alike : lined_snake ( tropidoclonion ) , one year and nine month ; red-bellied_snake ( storeria ) , two year ; cottonmouth ( ancistrodon ) , two year . 
person investigate the rattlesnake carefully himself and also summarize what others have find . 
he conclude that in the southern species , which be rapidly growing type , female mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young when they be three . 
other herpetologist have ascertain that in the northern united_states the prairie_rattlesnake may_not give_birth first birth until it be four or even five year old , and that the young may be_born every_other year , rather_than annually . 
person 's study show that female common garter_snake and ribbon_snake of location mature at about the age of two . 
oversized monster are never bring home either alive or preserved , and field measurement be obviously open_to doubt because of the universal tendency to exaggerate dimension . 
measurement of skin be of little value ; every snake hide be noticeably long than its carcass and intentional stretching present no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer . 
in_spite of all the pitfall , there be a certain amount of agreement on some of the giant . 
the anaconda prove to be the fly_in_the_ointment , but the reason for this be not clear ; the relatively wild condition still find in tropical location might be responsible . 
there be three level on which to treat the subject . 
the first be the strictly scientific , which demand concrete proof and therefore may err on the conservative side by wait for evidence in_the_flesh . 
this approach reject virtually all field measurement . 
the next level attempt to weigh varied evidence and come to a balanced , sensible conclusion ; field measurement by experienced explorer are not reject , and even report of a less scientific nature are duly evaluate . 
the third level lean_on a belief that a_lot of smoke mean some fire . 
the argument against this last approach be comparable_to that which reject story about hoop_snake , about snake that break themselves into many piece and join up again , or even of ghost that chase people out of graveyard ; the mere pile_up of testimony does not prove , to the scientific mind , the existence of hoop_snake , joint_snake , or ghost . 
person has recently use the second level approach with the largest snake , and has come to these conclusion : 
the anaconda reach a length of at_least 37 foot , the reticulate python 33 , the african rock_python 25 , the amethystine_python at_least 22 , the indian_python 20 , and the boa_constrictor 18 - 12 . 
person also treat of the largest snake , but on the third level , and is chiefly concern with the anaconda . 
he reason that as anaconda 30 foot long are often find , some might be 38 , and occasional `` monstrous freak '' over 50 . 
he reject dimension of 70 foot and more . 
his thirteenth chapter include many exciting account of huge serpent with prodigious strength , but these seem to be give to complete his picture , not to be believe . 
detailed information on record length of the giant is give in the section that follow . 
discussion of the giant one_by_one will include , as_far_as_possible , data on these aspect of growth : 
size at which life is start and at which sexual maturity is reach ; time require to reach maturity ; rate_of_growth both before and after this crucial stage ; and maximum length , with confirmation or amplification of person 's figure . 
definite information on the growth of senile individual be lack . 
at_birth , this species vary considerably in size . 
a brood of twenty-eight bear at group , near location , range in_length from 22 to 33 - 1 2 inch and average 29 inch . 
person give measurement of nineteen young anaconda , presumably member of a brood , from `` location '' ; the extreme measurement of these fall between the lower_limit of the group brood and its average . 
person have two brood that average 27 inch . 
person and person give approximately 20 inch as the average length of a brood of thirty from the region of the orinoco estuary . 
person report 26 inch and 2.4 ounce ( this snake must have be emaciated ) for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from location . 
in contrast , person record the average length of seventy-two young of a 19 - foot female as 38 inch , and four young be_born in location at a length of 35 or 36 inch and a weight of from 14 to 16 ounce . 
person have a 3 - foot anaconda that weigh only 9.8 ounce . 
a difference between subspecies might explain the great range in size . 
i have little information on the anaconda 's rate_of_growth . 
person have one that increase from 19 - 1 2 inch to 5 foot 3 inch in five year , and person record a growth of from less_than 4 foot to nearly 10 in about six year . 
it be very unlikely that either of these anaconda was grow at a normal rate . 
in 1948 , person , the noted brazilian herpetologist , write a technical paper on the giant snake . 
he conclude that the anaconda 's maximum length be 12 or 13 ( perhaps 14 ) meter , which would approximate from 39 to 42 foot ( 14 meter be slightly less that 46 foot ) . 
thus , his estimate lie between person 's suggestion of at_least 37 foot and the 50 - foot `` monstrous freak '' intimate by person . 
the most convincing recent measurement of an anaconda was make in eastern location by person , a petroleum_geologist of the group , and report in 1944 by person . 
however , as a field measurement , it be open_to question . 
person 's 37 - 1 2 foot be partly based on this report and can be accept as probable . 
however , many herpetologist remain skeptical and would prefer a tentative maximum of about 30 foot . 
it be possible that especially large anaconda will prove to belong_to subspecies limit to a small area . 
in snake difference in size be a common characteristic of subspecies . 
a colombian female 's brood of sixteen boa_constrictor bear in the group average 20 inch . 
this birth length seem to be typical . 
when some thirteen record of newly and recently bear individual are collate , little or no correlation between length and distribution can be detect . 
the range be from 14 to 25 inch ; the former figure be based on a somewhat unusual birth of four by a central_american female ( see chapter on laying , brooding , hatching , and birth ) , the latter on a `` normal '' newly bear individual . 
however , as so many of the record be not certainly based on newborn snake , these data must be take tentatively ; final conclusion will have_to await the measurement of brood from definite locality . 
person 's measurement of several very young specimen from location suggest that at_birth the female be slightly larger than the male . 
i have surprisingly little information on the size and age at maturity . 
person has write to me of sexual_activity in february 1943 of young bear in march 1940 . 
one female , collect on an island off the coast of location , be gravid and measure 4 foot 8 inch from snout to vent ( her tail should be between 6 and 7 inch long ) . 
the female from location which give_birth to four be only 3 foot 11 inch long . 
what data there be on growth indicate considerable variation in rate ; unfortunately , no_one has keep complete record of one individual , whereas many have been make for a very short period_of_time . 
the result be too varied to allow generalization . 
the bronchus and pulmonary_artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout . 
the pulmonary_vein , however , without the limiting supportive tissue septum as in type 1 , , follow a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship ( fig 8 , 22 ) . 
another marked difference is note here . 
the pulmonary_artery , in_addition to supply the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole , the alveolar duct , and the alveolus , continue on and directly supply the thin pleura ( fig 8 ) . 
the bronchial_artery , except for a small number of short branch in the hilum , contribute none of the pleural blood supply . 
it does , as in type 1 , , supply the hilar lymph_node , the pulmonary_artery , the pulmonary_vein , the bronchus , and the bronchiole - terminate in a common capillary_bed with the pulmonary_artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole . 
no bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomosis were note in this group . 
lung type 3 , ( fig 3 ) be to some degree a composite of type 1 , and 2 , . 
it is characterize by the presence of incompletely developed secondary lobule ; well defined , but haphazardly arranged , interlobular septum and a thick , remarkably vascular pleura ( fig 9 ) . 
the most distal airway be similar to those find in type 1 , , be composed of numerous , apparently true terminal bronchiole and occasional , poorly developed respiratory bronchiole ( fig 14 , 15 ) . 
in this instance , because of incomplete septation , the secondary lobule does not constitute in itself what appear to be a small individual lung as in type 1 , . 
air drift from one area to another be , therefore , conceivable . 
distally the bronchus be situated between a pulmonary_artery on one side and a pulmonary_vein on the other , as in type 1 , ( fig 24 ) . 
this relationship , however , is not maintain centrally . 
here the pulmonary_vein , as in type 2 , , is note to draw away from the bronchus , and to follow a more direct , independent course to the hilum ( fig 23 , 24 ) . 
the bronchial_artery in its course and distribution differ somewhat from that find in other mammal . 
as see in type 1 , and 2 , , it supply the hilar lymph_node , vasa_vasorum to the pulmonary_artery and pulmonary_vein , the bronchus and the terminal bronchiole . 
as in type 1 , , it provide arterial blood to the interlobular septum , and an extremely rich anastomotic pleural supply is see ( fig 9 , 10 ) . 
this pleural supply is derive both from hilar and interlobular bronchial_artery branch . 
such a dual derivation was strikingly demonstrate during the injection process where initial filling would be note to occur in several isolated pleural vessel at_once . 
some of these were obviously fill from interlobular branch of the bronchial_artery while others were fill from direct hilar branch follow along the pleural surface . 
with completion of filling , netlike anastomosis were note to be present between these separately derived branch . 
an unusual increase in the number of bronchial_artery present within the substance of the lung was note . 
this was account_for primarily by the presence of a bronchial_artery closely follow the pulmonary_artery . 
the diameter of this bronchial_artery be much too large for it to be a mere vasa_vasorum ( fig 16 , 23 , 24 ) . 
in distal region its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that of the pulmonary_artery . 
this vessel could be follow to the parenchyma where it directly provide bronchial arterial blood to the alveolar capillary_bed ( fig 17 , 18 ) . 
also three other direct pathway of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were note : via the pleura ; through the interlobular septum ; and along the terminal bronchiole ( fig 14 , 17 , 18 , 19 ) . 
one bronchial arteriolar pulmonary arteriolar anastomosis was note at the terminal bronchiolar level ( fig 26 ) . 
it be evident that many marked and striking difference exist between lung when an interspecies comparison is make . 
the significance of these difference has not be study nor has the existence of corresponding physiologic difference been determine . 
however , the dynamics of airflow , from morphologic consideration alone , may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse . 
the volume and , perhaps , even the characteristic of bronchial arterial blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse . 
also , interlobular air drift may be all_but nonexistent in the cow ; probably occur in the horse much_as in the human_being ; and , in contrast be present to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where lobule be absent ( person and person , ' 31 ) . 
a reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology be entirely lacking at_present . 
within certain wide limit anatomy dictate function and , if one is permit to speculate , potential pathology should be include in this statement as_well . 
for_example , the marked susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related_to its delicate , long alveolar duct and short , large bronchiole situate within a parenchyma entirely lack in protective supportive tissue barrier such_as those find in type 1 , and 3 , . 
one might also wonder if monkey be capable of develop bronchiolitis as we know it in man or the horse . 
in_addition , it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized emphysema occur in a cow , consider its marked lobular development but , conversely , not difficult to imagine this occur in the horse or the dog . 
anatomically , the horse lung appear to be remarkably like that of man , insofar as this can be ascertain from comparison of our finding in the horse with those of others ( person , ' 54 ) in the human_being . 
the only area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter be in regard_to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial_artery . 
as early as 1858 , person claim an alveolar distribution of the bronchial_artery in human_being . 
in 1951 , this was reaffirm by person . 
the opposition to this point_of_view have its staunch support in the work of person ( ' 50 ) . 
apparently , however , person has rely_on heavily on the anatomy in dog and cat , and he has been criticize for use pathologic human material in his normal study ( person , ' 38 ) . 
although person note in 1907 that a difference in the pleural blood supply exist between animal , nowhere in his published work is it find that he do a comparative study of the intrapulmonary feature of various mammalian lung other_than in the dog and cat ( person , ' 13 ; ' 25 ) . 
the meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial_artery as find in the horse be not clear . 
however , this artery is know to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal airway and supportive tissue of the lung . 
the alveolus and respiratory bronchiole be primarily diffusing tissue . 
theoretically , they be capable of extract their required oxygen either from the surrounding air ( person and person , ' 13 ) or from pulmonary arterial blood ( person , ' 58 ) . 
therefore , an explanation of this alveolar bronchial_artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased amount of supportive tissue , not primarily diffusing in nature , in the region of the alveolus . 
if this be true , the possibility exist that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial_artery might cause widespread degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that see in generalized emphysema . 
one would not expect such an event to occur in animal possess lung of type 1 , or 2 , . 
the presence of normally occur bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomosis was first note in 1721 by person , and thereafter by many others . 
person ( ' 58 ) , person ( ' 48 ) , person , person and person ( ' 50 ) , person ( ' 53 ) , and person ( ' 52 ) have all claim their normal but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human_being . 
person ( ' 50 ) be the principal antagonist of this viewpoint . 
in criticism of the latter 's view , his conclusion were base upon dog lung injection study in which all_of the vascular channel were first fill with a solution under pressure and then were inject with various sized colored particle design to stop at the arteriolar level . 
as early as 1913 person and person demonstrate with perfusion study in dog that bronchial_artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintain in the pulmonary_artery and pulmonary_vein , but that increase in bronchial_artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary_artery pressure . 
person , person and person in 1931 and person in 1958 reaffirm this . 
our own study in which bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomosis were demonstrate , were accomplish by inject the bronchial_artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary_artery or pulmonary_vein , and then by inject the pulmonary_artery and vein afterwards . 
it be distinctly possible , therefore , that simultaneous pressure in all three vessel would have render the shunt inoperable and hence , uninjectable . 
this viewpoint is further support by person 's ( ' 48 ) demonstration of thickened bronchial_artery and arteriolar muscular coat which be capable of act_as valve . 
in_other_words , the anastomosis between the bronchial_artery and pulmonary_artery should be consider as functional or demand shunt . 
in_addition , little work has been do on a comparative basis in regard_to the normal existence of bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomosis . 
person ( ' 48 ; ' 49 ) find these shunt in the human_being but be unable to find them in rat . 
person , person and person ( ' 52 ) also be unable to find them in rat . 
person ( ' 58 ) be unable to demonstrate their existence , either by anatomic or physiologic method , in dog . 
the possibility that the absence or presence of these shunt be species dependent is therefore infer . 
certainly , the mere fact of fail to demonstrate them in one or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that species . 
it be , however , highly suggestive and agree well with our own finding in which we also fail to demonstrate normally occur bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery shunt in certain species , especially the dog . 
in_conclusion , these finding suggest the need for a comparative physiology , pathology , and histology of mammalian lung . 
in_addition , a detailed interspecies survey of the incidence of generalized pulmonary_emphysema in mammal would be interesting and pertinent . 
also , for the present , great caution should be exercise in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary study if they are to be apply to man . 
this be especially so if the dog , cat or monkey are to be use , in_view_of their marked anatomical difference from man . 
finally , it is suggest that in many respect the horse lung may be anatomically more comparable_to that of the human than any other presently known species . 
the main subgross anatomical feature of the lung of various mammal are present . 
a tabulation of these feature permit the lung to be group into three distinctive subgross type . 
type 1 , is represent by the cow , sheep , and pig ; type 2 , , by the dog , cat , and monkey ; type 3 , , by the horse . 
lobularity be extremely well developed in type 1 , ; absent in type 2 , ; imperfectly developed in type 3 , . 
the pleura and interlobular septum be thick in type 1 , and 3 , . 
the pleura be extremely thin in type 2 , and septum be absent . 
arterial supply to the pleura in type 1 , and 3 , is provide by the bronchial_artery , and in type 2 , , by the pulmonary_artery . 
in type 1 , , 2 , and 3 , the bronchial_artery terminate in a capillary_bed share in common with the pulmonary_artery at the level of the distal bronchiole . 
in type 3 , the bronchial_artery also provide blood directly to the alveolar capillary_bed . 
true terminal bronchiole comprise the most frequent form take_form by the distal airway in type 1 , and 3 , , although small number of poorly developed respiratory bronchiole be present . 
well developed respiratory bronchiole , on_the_other_hand , appear to be the only form take_form by the distal airway in type 2 , . 
in type 1 , the pulmonary_vein closely follow the course of the bronchus and the pulmonary_artery from the periphery to the hilum . 
this maybe due_to the heavy interlobular connective_tissue barrier present . 
in type 3 , this general relationship is maintain peripherally but not centrally where the pulmonary_vein follow a more independent path to the hilum as be the case throughout the lung in type 2 , . 
some of the feature of the top portion of figure 1 and figure 2 were mention in discuss table 1 . 
first , the onset profile spread across approximately 12 year for boy and 10 year for girl . 
in contrast , 20 of the 21 line in the completion profile ( exclude center 5 for boy and 4 for girl ) are bunched and extend over a much short period , approximately 30 month for boy and 40 month for girl . 
the maturity chart for each sex demonstrate clearly that onset be a phenomenon of infancy and early_childhood whereas completion be a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . 
second , for both sex , the 21 transverse line in the onset profile vary more in individual spread than those in the completion profile . 
although the standard_deviation value on which spread of the line are base be relatively larger for those center which begin to ossify early ( table 1 ) , there are considerable difference in this value between center have the closely timed onset . 
third , the process of calcification is see to begin later and to continue much longer for these boy than for the girl , a fact which confirm data for other group of child . 
the onset profile and completion profile are construct to serve as norm for child . 
it is convenient to classify a child 's onset age and completion age as `` advanced '' , `` moderate '' ( modal ) , or `` delayed '' according_to whether the child 's age equivalent `` dot '' appear to the left of , upon , or to the right of the appropriate short transverse line . 
when a dot appear close to the end of the transverse line , the `` moderate '' rating may be further classify according_to the position of the dot with_respect_to the vertical marking denote the mean age . 
such classification may be call `` somewhat advanced '' or `` somewhat delayed '' , as the case may be , reserve `` moderate '' for dot upon or close to the mean . 
in the lower portion of each chart , the skeletal age ( hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classify . 
there the middle one of the three curve denote `` mean skeletal age '' for the maturity series boy and girl . 
the upper curve denote the mean plus one standard_deviation , and the lower curve represent the mean minus one standard_deviation . 
thus , a child 's skeletal age `` dot '' may be classified as `` advanced '' when they appear above the middle curve , `` moderate '' when they appear immediately above or below the middle curve , and `` delayed '' when they appear below the lower curve . 
to summarize the purpose of the skeletal maturity chart : each contain two kind of skeletal maturity norm which show two quite different method of depict developmental level of growth center . 
first , the upper portion require series of film for every child , consist_of those from hand , elbow , shoulder , knee , and foot . 
the lower portion necessitate only film of hand . 
second , the upper portion permit comparison of maturity level of an equal number of growth center from the long_bone , short_bone , and round_bone of the five region . 
the lower portion permit comparison of maturity level of short_bone and round_bone predominantly , since only two long_bone are include in hand and wrist as a region . 
third , the upper portion deal with only two indicator of developmental level , onset and completion . 
the lower portion utilize the full_complement of intermediate maturity indicator of each hand center as_well_as their onset and completion . 
fourth , the two indicator be for_the_most_part widely separated chronologically , with the extensive age gap occur during childhood for all but one growth center . 
the lower portion provide a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood . 
onset , completion , and skeletal age ( hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compare and classify , use only those skeletal age which appear immediately below the onset profile and the completion profile . 
it may be assume that difference in rating due_to selection of growth center from specific region of the body will be small , according_to existing table of onset age and completion age for center throughout the body . 
accordingly , maturity level rating by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the chart , respectively , should be somewhat similar since skeletal age assessment be dependent upon onset during infancy and upon completion during adolescence . 
it is clear that there are some difference in the rating , but there is substantial agreement . 
since a skeletal age rating can be make at any age during growth , from elbow , shoulder , knee , or foot as_well_as hand , it seem to be the method_of_choice when one wish to study most aspect of skeletal developmental progress during childhood . 
as state earlier in the paper , onset and completion - particularly the former - provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy in osseous development , each within a limited age period . 
such an indicator , or indicator , be needed as means of recognize specific period of delay in skeletal developmental progress . 
it was state earlier that one purpose of this study be to extend the analysis of variability of onset and completion in each of the 21 growth center somewhat beyond that provide by the data in table 1 and 2 . 
as one approach to do this , figure 3 and 4 have been construct from the mean age and the individual onset and completion age for boy 34 and girl 2 . 
the difference between onset age and completion age with_respect_to the corresponding mean age have been bring into juxtaposition by means of a series of arrow . 
the data for boy 34 appear in figure 3 , and for girl 2 in figure 4 . 
the numbering system use in table 1 and 2 and figure 1 and 2 was continue for the 21 growth center . 
the `` dot '' on one end of each arrow indicate extent of difference in month between the child 's onset age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center . 
the `` tip '' of the arrow represent extent of difference between the child 's completion age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center . 
thus , the alignment of the `` dot '' and `` tip '' , respectively , indicate individual variability of the 21 growth center of each child with_respect_to the mean value for these boy and girl . 
the direction in which the arrow point show how the maturity level of the growth center was change at completion from the level at onset . 
when the `` dot '' and `` tip '' coincide , the classification use in this paper be `` same schedule '' . 
the length of the arrow indicate amount of slowing or acceleration at completion over that at onset , and the difference in month can be read roughly by refer the arrow to the age scale along the base of each figure , or more precisely by refer to the original data in the appropriate table . 
the difference between the sequence of onset of ossification for the sex govern the numbering sequence in figure 3 and 4 . 
this difference is readily clarify by refer to table 1 . 
for_example , arrow 17 in figure 3 portray the proximal radial epiphysis for boy 34 , whereas the same epiphysis for girl 2 is portray by arrow 18 in figure 4 . 
for the boy , this epiphysis be markedly delayed at onset but near the mean at completion . 
thus , the span of its ossification was shorten and the center 's ability to `` catch_up '' in ossification is demonstrate . 
in contrast , for the girl the epiphysis be slightly advanced at onset and delayed at completion . 
obviously , the slowing for her may have occur at any point between onset and completion . 
the skeletal age curve in the lower portion of figure 2 show that slowing may have occur for her during the prepubescent period . 
length of the shaft of these arrow may be evaluate according_to the standard_deviation value for each center in table 1 . 
we have attempt to simplify the extensive task of analyze onset age and completion age of each child - more_than 1700 value for the entire group - by construct figure for each of the 21 center so that the data for all 34 boy and 34 of the girl will appear together for each growth center . 
figure 5 and 6 be example of our method of analyze the result for each growth center . 
forty other figure similar to 5 and 6 and the original data use in the construction of all figure and table in this monograph have been include in the appendix . 
the principle use in make each arrow for figure 3 and 4 were apply to the construction of figure 5 and 6 as_well_as all figure in the appendix . 
one growth center in a short_bone - distal phalanx of the second finger - was choose as an example for discussion here , primarily because epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion , the maturity indicator for completion in long_bone and short_bone , occur in this center for girl near the menarche and for boy near their comparable pubescent stage . 
its completion thus become one of the convenient maturity indicator to include in study of growth , dietary pattern , and health during adolescence . 
the following summary , base on figure 5 and 6 , be an example of one way of interpret the 42 figure construct from onset age and completion age of individual child with_respect_to the appropriate mean age for each growth center . 
at the top of figure 5 , for_example , the onset range and completion range line for the chosen growth center have been draw for girl according_to their mean and standard_deviation value in table 1 . 
the 34 arrow , denote onset age plus completion age deviation , have been array in an onset sequence which begin with girl 18 who have the early onset of the 34 girl . 
the growth center depict here , in the distal phalanx of the second finger , is list as the fifth of those in the seven short_bone . 
the mean onset age be 25.3 month ( table 1 ) , and the average span of the osseous stage be 133 month . 
the correlation ( table 2 ) between onset age and completion age be + .50 , and that between onset age and span be - .10 . 
with due consideration for the limit of precision in assess , expected rate of change in ossification of girl age 2 year , and the known variation in rate of ossification of these child as describe in our preceding paper in the supplement , each arrow with a `` shaft length '' of four month or less was select as indicate `` same schedule '' at onset and completion , for this particular epiphysis . 
accordingly , girl 31 , 29 , 33 , 21 , 26 , 13 , 3 , 4 , 14 , 32 , 24 , 25 , 34 , 23 , 6 , 15 , 22 , and 16 may be say to have the `` same schedule '' at onset and completion . 
it seem clear , from the counterbalanced shape of the series of arrow in figure 5 that there was about an equal number of early and late onset and completion for the 34 girl . 
accordingly , if epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion occur in this phalanx near menarche , early and late menarche might have been forecast rather precisely at the time of onset of ossification for the 18 girl with `` same schedule '' . 
as an example of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which exceed four month in shaft length in conjunction with its position in the figure : girl 2 have a delayed onset and further delayed completion . 
it is of interest that her menarche be somewhat late than the average for the girl in this group . 
a similar analysis of figure 6 for the 34 boy would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value of onset age in forecast their attainment of the pubescent stage . 
boy 32 , 23 , 31 , 17 , 30 , 19 , and 24 have `` same schedule '' at onset and completion ; thus early forecasting of the pubescent stage would appear possible for only seven boy . 
boy 34 , like girl 2 , did not have `` same schedule '' ; his arrow cross the line denote the mean . 
the `` dot '' on his arrow indicate early onset and the `` tip '' indicate relatively late completion . 
after the 42 figure had been draw like figure 5 and 6 , classification of the onset age and completion age be summarize from them . 
interestingly enough , the effect of the digitalis_glycoside is inhibit by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhance by the absence of potassium ( person , 1960 ) . 
the precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as_yet completely understand . 
however , the formation of organically bind iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplish in cell-free system . 
in the absence of addition to the homogenate , the product form be an iodinated particulate protein ( person and person , 1953 ; person , person and person , 1955 ; person , person , person , and person , 1956 ; person and person , 1958 ; person and person , 1960 ) . 
this iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what be normally present in the thyroid , and there be no evidence so_far that thyroglobulin can be iodinate in_vitro by cell-free system . 
in_addition , the iodoamino_acid form in largest quantity in the intact thyroid be di-iodotyrosine . 
if tyrosine and a system generate hydrogen_peroxide are add to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantity of free mono-iodotyrosine can be form ( person , 1959 ) . 
it be not clear whether this system bear any resemblance to the in_vivo iodinating mechanism , and a system generate peroxide has not been identify in thyroid tissue . 
on chemical grounds it seem most likely that iodide is first convert to * * f and then to * * f as the active iodinating species . 
in the thyroid_gland it appear that protein ( chiefly thyroglobulin ) be iodinated and that free tyrosine and thyronine be not iodinated . 
iodination of tyrosine , however , be not enough for the synthesis of hormone . 
the mono-iodotyrosine - and di-iodotyrosine must be couple to form tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine . 
the mechanism of this coupling has been study in some detail with nonenzymatic system in_vitro and can be simulate by certain di-iodotyrosine analogue ( person and person , 1958 ) . 
there be so_far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this coupling be under enzymatic control . 
the chemical nature of the iodocompound is discuss below ( pp. 76 et_seq. ) . 
little is know of the synthetic mechanism for formation of thyroglobulin . 
its synthesis has not been demonstrate in cell-free system , nor has its synthesis by system with intact thyroid cell in_vitro been unequivocally prove . 
there be some reason to think that thyroglobulin synthesis may proceed independently of iodination , for in certain transplantable tumour of the rat thyroid contain essentially no iodinated thyroglobulin , a protein that appear to be thyroglobulin has been observe in ultracentrifuge experiment ( person , person and person , 1959 ) . 
similar finding have been note in a patient with congenital absence of the organification enzyme , whose thyroid tissue could only concentrate iodide . 
in_addition , depending_on availability of dietary iodine , thyroglobulin may contain vary quantity of iodine . 
since the circulating thyroid_hormone be the amino_acid thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine ( cf. section c ) , it be clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid_gland for their release from protein before secretion . 
the presence of several protease and peptidase has been demonstrate in the thyroid . 
one of the protease have ph optimum of about 3.7 and another of about 5.7 ( person , person and person , 1954 ; person , person and person , 1955 ) . 
the finding that the concentration of one of these protease is increase in thyroid_gland from tsh treat animal suggest that this protease may be active in_vivo . 
there be no conclusive evidence yet that either of the protease has been prepare in highly purify form nor is their specificity know . 
a study of their activity on thyroglobulin has show that thyroxine is not preferentially release and that the degradation proceed stepwise with the formation of macromolecular intermediate ( person , person and person , 1956 ) . 
besides proteolytic enzyme the thyroid possess de-iodinating enzyme . 
a microsomal de-iodinase with a ph optimum of around 8 , and require reduced triphosphopyridine_nucleotide for activity , has been identify in the thyroid ( person , 1957 ) . 
this de-iodinating enzyme be effective against mono-iodotyrosine - and di-iodotyrosine , but does not de-iodinate thyroxine or tri-iodothyronine . 
it is assume that the iodine release from the iodotyrosine remain in the iodide pool of the thyroid , where it is oxidise and re-incorporate into thyroglobulin . 
the thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine release by proteolysis and so escape de-iodination presumably diffuse into the bloodstream . 
it has been show that thyroglobulin bind thyroxine , but the binding does not appear to be particularly strong . 
it has been suggest that the plasma thyroxine binding protein , which have an extremely high affinity for thyroxine , compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine ( person and person , 1957 ) . 
antithyroid drug be of two general type . 
one type have a small univalent anion of the thiocyanate perchlorate fluoroboride type . 
this ion inhibit thyroid_hormone synthesis by interfere with iodide concentration in the thyroid . 
it does not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism as_such . 
the other group of antithyroid agent or drug is typify by thiouracil . 
these drug have no effect on the iodide concentrate mechanism , but they inhibit organification . 
the mechanism of action of these drug has not been completely work_out , but certain of them appear to act by reduce the oxidised form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin ( person , 1954 ) . 
on_the_other_hand , there be a_few antithyroid drug of this same general type , such as resorcinol , possess no reducing activity and possibly act through formation of a complex with molecular iodine . 
any of the antithyroid drug , of either type , if give in large enough dose for a long period_of_time will cause goitre , owing to inhibition of thyroid_hormone synthesis , with production of hypothyroidism . 
the anterior lobe of the pituitary then respond by an increased output of tsh , cause the thyroid to enlarge . 
the effect of drug that act_on the iodide concentrate mechanism can be counteract by addition of relatively large amount of iodine to the diet . 
the antithyroid drug of the thiouracil type , however , are not antagonise by such means . 
besides those of the thiouracil and resorcinol type , certain antithyroid drug have been find in naturally occur food . 
the most conclusively identify be l - 5 - vinyl - 2 - thio_oxazolidone , which was isolate from rutabaga ( person , 1950 ) . 
it is presume to occur in other member of the brassica family . 
there be some evidence that naturally occur goitrogen may play a role in the development of goitre , particularly in location and location ( person and person , 1956 ) . 
there it seem that the goitrogen ingest by dairy animal be itself inactive but is convert in the animal to an active goitrogen , which is then secrete in the milk . 
besides the presence of goitrogen in the diet , the level of iodine itself in the diet play a major role in govern the activity of the thyroid_gland . 
in the experimental animal and in man gross deficiency in dietary iodine cause thyroid hyperplasia , hypertrophy and increased thyroid activity ( person , person and person , 1952 ; person , person , person , person , person , and person , 1954 ) . 
in man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary to prevent development of goitre be about 100 | mg per day . 
with low level , thyroid hypertrophy and increased thyroid blood flow enable the thyroid to accumulate a larger proportion of the daily intake of iodine . 
further , the gland be able to reuse a larger fraction of the thyroid_hormone de-iodinate peripherally . 
in the presence of a low iodine intake , thyroglobulin label in_vivo with * * f is find to contain more mono-iodotyrosine than normal , the amount of di-iodotyrosine and iodothyronine being correspondingly reduce . 
this appear to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more rapid secretion of newly iodinated thyroglobulin . 
if the deficiency persist long enough , it be reasonable to suppose that the * * f label will reflect the * * f distribution in the thyroglobulin . 
similar result might be expect from the influence of drug or pathological condition that limit iodide trap , or organification , or accelerate thyroglobulin proteolysis . 
the name thyroid-stimulating_hormone ( tsh ) has been give to a substance find in the anterior pituitary_gland of all species of animal so_far test for its presence . 
the hormone has also been called thyrotrophin or thyrotrophic_hormone . 
at the present_time we do not know by what biochemical_mechanism tsh act_on the thyroid , but for bioassay of the hormone there be a number of property by which its activity may be estimate , include release of iodine from the thyroid , increase in thyroid weight , increase in mean height of the follicular cell and increase in the thyroidal uptake of * * f . 
here we shall restrict discussion to those method that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determine the concentration of tsh in blood . 
person ( 1959 ) has review generally the various method of assay tsh , and the reader is refer to her paper for further information on the subject . 
as long_ago as 1851 it was point_out by person ( 1851 ) that there be a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid . 
. 
this connection was clarify by person and person ( 1922 ) , who show that saline extract of fresh bovine pituitary_gland could reactivate the atrophied thyroid of hypophysectomised tadpole . 
the first attempt to isolate tsh come a decade later , when person and person ( 1931 ) use trichloroacetic_acid to separate the soluble tsh from insoluble impurity . 
after their work other investigator apply salt fractionation technique to the problem , as_well_as fractionation with organic solvent , such_as acetone . 
person ( 1949 ) has conclude that the most active preparation of tsh make during this period , from 1931 to 1945 , be probably about 100 to 300 times as potent as the starting material . 
much of this work has been review by person ( 1944 ) and by person ( 1949 ) . 
development up_to about 1957 have been discuss by person ( 1958 ) . 
in the last few year , the application of chromatographic and other modern technique to the problem of isolate tsh has lead to further purification ( person and person , 1960 ; person , person and person , 1960 ) . 
the most active preparation obtain by these two group of investigator appear to be similar in potency , composition and physical_property . 
two problem present themselves in consider any hormone in blood . 
first , be the circulating form of the hormone the same as that find in the gland where it is synthesise and store ? 
second , what be its concentration in normal circumstance and in what circumstance will this concentration depart from the normal level and in which direction ? 
it be therefore necessary to consider the property of pituitary tsh if the fragmentary chemical information about blood tsh is to be discuss rationally . 
the importance of know in what chemical form the hormone may exist is accentuate by the recent observation that there exist an abnormally long-acting tsh in blood draw from many thyrotoxic patient ( person , 1958 ) . 
whether this abnormal tsh differ chemically from pituitary tsh , or be , alternatively , normal tsh with its period of effectiveness modify by some other blood constituent , cannot be decide without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patient and a comparison of the substance responsible_for the blood activity with pituitary tsh . 
in evaluate data on the concentration of tsh in blood , one must examine critically the bioassay method use to obtain them . 
the introduction of the group reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equate of the group and international unit of thyroid stimulate activity have make_possible possible to compare result publish by different investigator since that time . 
we should_like to re-emphasise the importance of state result solely in_terms_of international unit of tsh activity and of avoid the re-introduction of biological unit . 
for_the_most_part , this discussion will be confine to result obtain since the introduction of the reference standard . 
the international unit ( u . ) , adopt to make possible the comparison of result from different laboratory ( person and person , 1955 ) , has been define as the amount of activity present in 13.5 mg of the international_standard_preparation . 
the international unit be equipotent with the group unit adopt in 1952 , which was define as the amount of activity present in 20 mg of the group reference substance . 
muscle weakness is now recognize as an uncommon though serious complication of steroid therapy , with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroid in clinical use . 
although biopsy have show structural change in some of the reported case of steroid induced weakness , this case provide the only example know to us in which necropsy afford the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle group . 
the case describe in this paper be that of an older man who develop disabling muscular weakness while receive a variety of steroid for a refractory anemia . 
this patient be a 65 - year old white male accountant who enter the group for his fourth and terminal admission on june 26 , 1959 , because of disabling weakness and general debility . 
in 1953 the patient develop an unexplained anemia for which 15 blood_transfusion were give over a period of 4 year . 
splenomegaly was first note in 1956 , and a sternal marrow biopsy at that time show `` scattered focus of fibrosis '' suggestive_of myelofibrosis . 
no additional transfusion be necessary after the institution of prednisone in july , 1957 , in an initial dose of 40 mg daily with gradual taper to 10 mg daily . 
this medication was continue until february , 1958 . 
in february , 1958 , the patient suffer a myocardial_infarction complicate by pulmonary edema . 
additional finding at this time include cardiomegaly , peripheral arteriosclerosis_obliterans , and cholelithiasis . 
the hemoglobin be 11.6 gm . 
therapy include digitalization and anticoagulation . 
later , chlorothiazide and salt restriction become necessary to control the edema of chronic congestive failure . 
because of increasing anemia , triamcinolone , 8 mg daily , was start on feb 23 , 1958 , and was continue until july , 1958 . 
in september , 1958 , the patient develop generalized weakness and fatigue which be concurrent with exacerbation of his anemia ; the hemoglobin be 10.6 gm . 
in an attempt to reverse the downhill trend by stimulate the bone_marrow and control any hemolytic component , triamcinolone , 16 mg daily , was begin on sept 26 , 1958 , and continue until feb 18 , 1959 . 
at_first the patient feel strong , and the hemoglobin rise to 13.8 gm , but on oct 20 , 1958 , he complain of `` cave_in '' in his knee . 
by nov 8 , 1958 , weakness , specifically involve the pelvic and thigh musculature , was pronounced , and a common complaint be `` difficulty in step up on to curb '' . 
prednisone , 30 mg daily , was substitute for triamcinolone from nov 22 until dec 1 , 1958 , without any improvement in the weakness . 
serum potassium at this time be 3.8 meq per liter , and the hemoglobin be 13.9 gm by dec 1 , 1958 , the weakness in the pelvic and quadriceps muscle group be appreciably worse , and it become difficult for the patient to rise unaided from a sitting or reclining position . 
triamcinolone , 16 mg daily , was resume and maintain until feb 18 , 1959 . 
chlorothiazide was omit for a 2 - week period , but there be no change in the muscle weakness . 
at this time a detailed neuromuscular examination reveal diffuse muscle atrophy that be moderate in the hand and foot , but more marked in the shoulder , hip , and pelvic_girdle , with hypoactive deep tendon reflex . 
no fasciculation or sensory defect were find . 
electromyography reveal no evidence of lower motor_neuron disease . 
thyroid function test yield normal result . 
the protein bound iodine be 6.6 | mg  , and the radioactive iodine uptake over the thyroid_gland be 46  in 24 hour , with a conversion ratio of 12  . 
a schilling_test demonstrate normal absorption of vitamin * * f . 
in february , 1959 , during the second admission to the group , a biopsy specimen of the left gastrocnemius show striking increase in the sarcolemmal sheath nucleus and shrink muscle_fiber in several section . 
serial serum potassium level remain normal ; the serum glutamic_oxaloacetic_transaminase be 10 unit per ml per min . 
the clinical impression at this time be either muscular_dystrophy or polymyositis . 
on feb 12 , 1959 , purify corticotropin ( acth_gel ) , 20 unit daily intramuscularly , was start but had_to be discontinue 3 week later because of excessive fluid retention . 
from march 3 to may 1 , 1949 , the patient was maintain on dexamethasone , 3 to 6 mg daily . 
in may 1959 , prednisone , 30 mg daily , replace the dexamethasone . 
muscle weakness did not improve , and the patient need first a cane , then crutch . 
in_spite of normal thyroid function test , a trial of propylthiouracil , 400 mg daily for one week , was give but serve only to intensify muscle weakness . 
repeated attempt to withdraw steroid entirely be unsuccessful because increased muscle weakness result , as_well_as fever , malaise , anorexia , anxiety , and an exacerbation of the anemia . 
these reaction were interpret as be manifestation of hypoadrenocorticism . 
severe back pain in june , 1959 , prompt a third hospital admission . 
extensive osteoporosis with partial collapse of d8 was find . 
a high protein diet , calcium_lactate supplement , and norethandrolone fail to change the skeletal complaint or the severe muscle weakness .

the mucosa of the stomach be atrophic and irregularly blacken over a 14 cm area . 
the small_intestine and large_intestine were fill with gas , and the jejunum was dilate to about 2 times its normal circumference . 
the small_intestine and colon contain approximately 300 cc of foul-smelling , sanguineous material , and the mucosa throughout be hyperemic and mottled green brown . 
a careful search fail to show occlusion of any of the mesenteric vessel . 
microscopically , the mucosa of the stomach show extensive cytolysis and contain large_number of gram-negative bacterial rod . 
the submucosa was focally infiltrate with neutrophil . 
the mucosa of the jejunum and ileum show similar change , and in some area the submucosa be edematous and contain considerable number of neutrophil . 
some of the small vessel were fill with fibrin thrombus , and there be extensive interstitial hemorrhage . 
a section of the colon reveal intense hyperemia and extensive focal ulceration of the mucosa , associated with much fibrin and many neutrophil . 
culture take from the jejunum yield monilia_albicans , pseudomonas_pyocanea , aerobacter_aerogenes , and streptococcus_anhemolyticus . 
the kidney be pale and weigh right , 110 gm , and left , 230 gm . 
the surface be coarsely and finely granular and punctuate by clear , fluid filled cyst measure up_to 3 cm in diameter . 
on the surface of the right kidney there be also 2 yellow , firm , friable raised area measure up_to 2 cm in diameter . 
microscopically , both kidney show many small cortical scar in which there be glomerular and interstitial fibrosis , tubular atrophy , and an infiltration of lymphocyte and plasma cell . 
occasional tubule contain hyaline cast admix with neutrophil . 
throughout , there be marked arteriolosclerosis and hyalinization of afferent glomerular arteriole . 
these change be more marked in the atrophic right kidney than in the left . 
in_addition , there be 2 small papillary adenoma in the right kidney . 
the bone of the vertebral body , rib , and sternum be soft and was easily compress . 
the marrow of the vertebral body be pale and show area of fatty replacement . 
microscopically , there be many area of hypercellularity alternate with area of hypocellularity . 
the cell of the erythroid , myeloid , and megakaryocytic series be normal except for their number . 
there be no evidence of fibrosis . 
the muscle of the extremity , chest wall , neck , and abdominal wall be soft , pale , and atrophic . 
microscopic study of the gastrocnemius , pectoralis_major , transversus_abdominis , biceps_brachii , and diaphragm show atrophy as_well_as vary degree of injury range from swelling and vacuolization to focal necrosis of the muscle_fiber . 
these change be most marked in the gastrocnemius and biceps and less evident in the pectoralis , diaphragm , and transversus . 
in the gastrocnemius and biceps there be many swollen and homogeneous necrotic fiber such_as that show in figure 2 . 
such swollen fiber be deeply eosinophilic , contain a_few pyknotic nucleus , and show loss of cross striation , obliteration of myofibril , and prominent vacuolization . 
the necrosis often involve only a portion of the length of a given fiber , and usually the immediately adjacent fiber be normal . 
as show in figure 3 , the protoplasm of other fiber be pale , granular , or flocculate and invade by phagocyte . 
inflammatory cell be strikingly absent . 
in_association_with these change in the fiber , there be striking alteration in the muscle nucleus . 
these were increased both in number and in size , contain prominent nucleolus , and were distribute throughout the fiber ( fig 2 - 5 ) . 
in contrast to the nuclear change describe above , another change in muscle nucleus was see , usually occur in fiber that be somewhat smaller than normal but that show distinct cross striation and myofibrilla . 
the nucleus of these fiber , as is show in figure 3 and 4 , show remarkable proliferation and were closely approximate , form a chain like structure at either the center or the periphery of the fiber . 
individual nucleus be usually oval to round , though occasionally elongate , and frequently small and somewhat pyknotic . 
at_times , clump of 10 to 15 closely packed nucleus were also observe . 
occasionally there be small basophilic fiber that be devoid_of myofibrilla and contain many vesicular nucleus with prominent nucleolus ( fig 5 ) . 
these were think to represent regenerating fiber . 
trichrome stain fail to show fibrosis in the involved muscle . 
in all_of the section examine , the arteriole and small artery be essentially normal . 
in attempt to improve specificity of staining , the fluorescein labeled antiserum use in both direct and indirect method were treat in one of several way : ( 1 ) they were pass_through dowex-2-chloride twice and treat with acetone insoluble powder ( person , 1958 ) prepare from mouse liver or from healthy sweet_clover stem or crown_gall tissue produce by agrobacterium_tumefaciens ( person + person ) location , on sweet_clover stem . 
( 2 ) the conjugate as_well_as the intermediate serum were absorb for 30_minutes with 20 - 50 mg of protein extract from healthy sweet_clover stem . 
the protein were extract with 3 volume of * * f in * * f to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitate by 80  saturation with * * f . 
the precipitate was wash twice with an 80  saturated solution of * * f , dissolve in a small quantity of 0.1 m neutral phosphate buffer , dialyze against cold distilled_water till free from ammonium_ion , and lyophilize use liquid_nitrogen . 
( 3 ) in other experiment the indirect conjugate was treat with 3 volume of ethyl_acetate as recommend by person and person ( 1957 ) . 
( 4 ) the conjugate were pass_through a diethylaminoethyl_cellulose ( deae - ) cellulose column equilibrate with neutral phosphate buffer ( pbs ) contain * * f potassium phosphate and * * f . 
the technique of cutting section be essentially the same as that describe by person et_al. ( 1951 ) . 
root and stem tumor from sweet_clover plant infected with wtv be quick-frozen in liquid_nitrogen , embed in ice , and cut at 3 - 6 | m in a cryostat maintain at - 16 ` to - 20 ` . 
the section were mount on cold slide smear with person ' adhesive ( person , 1940 ) in earlier experiment , and in later experiment with a different mixture of the same component report by person and person ( 1959 ) . 
the latter adhesive was find to be much more satisfactory . 
the section were then thaw by place a finger under the slide and dry under a fan for 30_minutes ; until use they were store for as_long_as 2 week . 
the section were fix in acetone for 15_minutes and dry at 37 ` for 30_minutes . 
some of them were then cover with a drop of * * f in a moist chamber at 24 ` for 30 - 40 minute . 
as control other section were similarly cover with ns . 
section were then wash with pbs for 15 - 30_minutes . 
after blot_out most of the saline around the section , a drop of * * f was layer over each of the section , allow to react for 30_minutes , and then wash with pbs for 15 - 30_minutes . 
after blot_out most of the liquid around the section , the latter were mount in buffer glycerine ( 7 part glycerine to 3 part of pbs ) . 
after dry the section under the fan , fix in acetone , and dry at 37 ` as in the indirect method , the section were treat with conjugated * * f or * * f ( undiluted unless mention otherwise ) for 5 - 30_minutes . 
as control , other section were similarly treat with * * f or conjugated antiserum to the location strain of potato_yellow-dwarf_virus ( person and person , 1956 ) . 
the section were then wash with pbs for 15 - 30_minutes and mount in buffer glycerine . 
stained or unstained section were examine under dark_field_illumination in a zeiss fluorescence microscope equip with a mercury vapor lamp ( osram_hbo 200 ) . 
the light_beam from the lamp was filter through a half standard thickness corning 1840 filter . 
in the eyepiece a wratten 2 b filter was use to filter off residual ultraviolet_light . 
a red filter , zeiss barrier filter with the code ( schott ) designation bg 23 , was also use in the ocular lens assembly as it improve the contrast between specific and nonspecific fluorescence . 
in the first few experiment * * f was pass_through dowex-2-chloride twice and absorb twice with 50 - 100 mg sweet_clover tissue powder . 
the intermediate serum were also similarly absorb with tissue powder . 
section of sweet_clover stem and root tumor were treat with 1 : 10 solution of * * f for 30_minutes , wash in buffer saline for 15_minutes , stain with * * f for 30_minutes , and wash for 15_minutes in pbs . 
such section show bright yellow-green specific fluorescence in the cell of the pseudophloem tissue ( person and person , 1955 ) . 
this specific fluorescence was readily distinguish from the light-green nonspecific fluorescence in consecutive section stain with 1 : 10 dilution of ns and * * f or with * * f alone . 
unstained section mount in buffer glycerine or section treat only with ns or * * f did not show such green fluorescence . 
section of crown_gall tissue similarly stain with either * * f and * * f or ns and * * f also show only the light-green nonspecific fluorescence . 
however , the nonspecific staining by the * * f in tumor section was consider bright enough to be confuse with the staining of small amount of wtv antigen . 
two absorption of * * f with ethyl_acetate or two absorption of * * f ( which had been pass_through dowex-2-chloride ) , ns and * * f with crown_gall tissue powder , or mouse liver powder did not further improve the specificity of staining . 
treatment of all the serum with sweet_clover protein greatly reduce nonspecific fluorescence , especially when the treated conjugate was dilute to 1 : 2 with 0.85  saline . 
in all the above procedure , when the intermediate serum were dilute to 1 : 10 or 1 : 100 with 0.85  saline , the specific and nonspecific fluorescence were not appreciably reduce , whereas , a dilution of the intermediate serum to 1 : 500 or dilute the * * f to 1 : 5 greatly reduce specific fluorescence . 
rinse the section with pbs before layer the intermediate serum did not improve the staining reaction . 
in_addition to other treatment , treat the section with normal sheep serum for half an hour before layer * * f did not reduce nonspecific staining . 
the only treatment by which nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily remove be by pass_through the conjugate through a deae_cellulose column . 
when 1 ml of conjugate was pass_through a column ( * * f ) , the first and second milliliter fraction collect be the most specific and give no nonspecific staining in some experiment , and very little in others . 
in the latter case an additional treatment of the deae cellulose treated * * f with 50 mg of sweet_clover stem tissue powder further improve the specificity . 
after these treatment the conjugate did not stain healthy or crown_gall sweet_clover tissue or stain them a very faint green which be easily distinguishable from the bright yellow-green specific staining . 
with this purified conjugate the best staining procedure consist_of treat the section with 1 : 10 dilution of * * f for 30_minutes , wash with pbs for 15_minutes , stain with * * f for 30_minutes , and wash with pbs for 15_minutes . 
the specificity of staining in wtv tumor with * * f and * * f but not with ns and * * f or with antiserum to potato_yellow-dwarf_virus and * * f , and the absence of such staining in crown_gall tumor tissue from sweet_clover , indicate that an antigen of wtv was being stain . 
* * f was first conjugated with 50 mg of fitc per gram of globulin . 
this conjugate was pass_through twice through dowex-2-chloride and treat with various tissue powder in the same manner as describe for the indirect method . 
in all case a disturbing amount of nonspecific staining be still present although it be still distinguishable from specific fluorescence . 
in later experiment , * * f and * * f were prepare by conjugate 8 mg of fitc per gram of globulin . 
these conjugate * * f have much less nonspecific staining than the previous conjugate ( with 50 mg fitc per gram of globulin ) while the specific staining be similar in both case . 
nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily eliminate by pass_through these conjugate through a deae_cellulose column as describe for * * f . 
the best staining procedure with this purified * * f consist_of stain with the conjugate for 30_minutes and wash in pbs for 15_minutes . 
the specificity of staining with * * f was establish as_follows : * * f specifically stained tumor section but not section of healthy sweet_clover stem or of crown_gall tumor tissue from sweet_clover . 
section of tumor incite by wtv were not similarly stain with conjugated normal serum or conjugated antiserum to potato_yellow-dwarf_virus . 
after pass_through * * f through deae_cellulose , the titer of antibody to wtv in the specific fraction be 1 : 4 of the titer before such passage ( precipitin ring test by person ) ; but mere dilution of the conjugate to 1 : 4 did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific staining . 
this indicate that increase in specificity of * * f after pass_through it through deae_cellulose be_due not merely due_to dilution . 
specific staining by deae_cellulose treat * * f and * * f , although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either nonspecific staining or autofluorescence of cell , was not satisfactorily photograph to show such difference in_spite_of many attempt with black_and_white and color photography . 
this be chiefly because of the bluish white autofluorescence from the cell . 
the autofluorescence from the wall of the xylem cell be particularly brilliant . 
result of specific staining by the direct and the indirect method be similar and show the localization of wtv antigen in certain tissue of tumor . 
the virus antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue . 
frequently a_few isolated thick walled cell or , rarely , group of such cell in the xylem region , were also specifically stain , but there be no such staining in epidermis , cortex , most xylem cell , ray cell , or pith . 
within the pseudophloem cell the distribution of wtv antigen be irregular in the cytoplasm . 
no antigen be detectable in certain dark spherical area in most cell . 
these area be think to represent the nucleus . 
in some tumor section small spherical body , possibly inclusion_body ( person and person , 1952 ) stain more intensely than the rest of cytoplasm and probably contain more antigen . 
in all case study tissue of the stem on which the tumor had develop did not contain detectable amount of wtv antigen . 
in both the direct and indirect method of staining , the conjugate have nonspecifically staining fraction . 
in the indirect method , this be evident from the fact that tumor section were stain light-green even when stain with ns and * * f or with * * f only . 
in the direct method , * * f , not further treat , stain certain tissue of healthy sweet_clover stem nonspecifically and wtv tumor section were similarly stain by comparable * * f . 
after * * f and * * f were pass_through dowex-2-chloride twice and treat twice with healthy sweet_clover tissue powder , nonspecific staining was greatly reduce but a disturbing amount of such staining be still present . 
treatment of the conjugate with ethyl_acetate , and the conjugate ( which had been pass_through dowex-2-chloride ) with mouse liver powder , sweet_clover crown_gall tissue powder , or healthy sweet_clover protein did not satisfactorily remove nonspecifically staining substance in the conjugate . 
such treatment of the conjugate have usually be successful in eliminate nonspecific staining in several other system ( person , 1958 ) . 
person and person ( 1959 ) did not report any such nonspecific staining of plant_tissue with fluorescein isocyanate labeled antiserum to tobacco_mosaic_virus . 
the reason for the failure of these treatment to eliminate nonspecific staining in the conjugate in our system is not know . 
in our work the best procedure for remove substance cause nonspecific staining in_order to obtain specific conjugate was to pass_through the conjugate through a deae_cellulose column and in some case to absorb the first and second milliliter fraction with sweet_clover tissue powder . 
the specific staining by both direct and indirect method show that wtv antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a_few thick walled cell in the xylem region , but be not detectable in any other tissue of the root and stem tumor . 
a study of the distribution of wtv antigen within the pseudophloem cell indicate that it be irregularly distribute in the cytoplasm . 
wound_tumor_virus be a leafhopper transmit virus not easily transmissible by mechanical inoculation ( person , 1944 ; person et_al. , 1954 ) . 
the concentration and apparent localization of the wtv antigen in pseudophloem tissue of the tumor may indicate that the virus preferentially multiply in the phloem and may need to be directly place in this tissue in_order_to infect plant . 
since emotional reaction in the higher vertebrate depend_on individual experience and are arouse in man , in_addition , by complex symbol , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excite from the cortex . 
in experiment with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral_cortex , the transmission of impulse from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrate . 
moreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increase under these condition . 
even more complex and obviously cortically induce form of emotional_arousal could be elicit in monkey a on see monkey b ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress . 
a previously extinguished conditioned_reaction was restore in monkey a and was associate with typical sign of emotional excitement include sympathetic discharge . 
it seem to follow that by_and_large an antagonism exist between the paleocortex - and the neocortex as_far_as emotional reactivity is concern , and that the balance between the two system determine the emotional responsiveness of the organism . 
in_addition , the neocortical hypothalamic relation play a great role in primates , as person 's interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect '' demonstrate . 
but even in relatively primitive laboratory animal such_as the rat , sex_activity closely identify with the hypothalamus and the visceral_brain is enhance by the neocortex . 
person stress correctly the importance of the visceral_brain for preservation of the individual and the species , as evidence by the influence of the limbic_brain ( include the hypothalamus ) on emotion related_to fight and flight and also on sexual function . 
it should be add that in man neocortical hypothalamic interrelation probably play a role in the fusion of emotional process with those underlying perception , memory , imagination , and creativity . 
previous experience be obviously of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional response . 
the visceral_brain as_well_as the neocortex is know to contribute to memory , but this topic be beyond the scope of this paper . 
after this brief discussion of neocortical - , paleocortical , and cortico-hypothalamic relation , let us return once_more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and its physiological and pathological significance . 
facilitatory process take_place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending and descending pathway . 
thus corticofugal discharge induce by topical application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate with spike present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive discharge . 
on_the_other_hand , the temporary reduction in hypothalamic excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior hypothalamus cause a lessening in frequency and amplitude of cortical strychnine spike until the hypothalamic excitability is restore . 
apparently , a positive_feedback exist between the posterior hypothalamus and the cerebral_cortex . 
consequently , if for any reason the hypothalamic excitability fall below the physiological level , the lessened hypothalamic cortical discharge lead to a diminished state of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the corticofugal discharge . 
obviously , a vicious_cycle develop . 
this tendency can be break either by restore hypothalamic excitability directly or via cortico-hypothalamic pathway . 
it is believe that drug therapy and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism . 
before we comment far on these pathological condition , we should remember that change in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological limit distinguish sleep from wakefulness . 
thus , a low intensity of hypothalamic cortical discharge prevail in sleep and a high one during wakefulness , result in synchronous eeg potential in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition . 
moreover , the dominance in parasympathetic action ( with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic ) at the hypothalamic level induce , by its peripheral action , the autonomic symptom of sleep and , by its action on the cortex , a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus of the somatic nervous_system . 
with the dominance of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus , the opposite change occur . 
since electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produce the effect of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induce sleep , it may be say that the reactivity of the whole organism is alter by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus . 
similar effect can be induce reflexly via the baroreceptor reflex in man and animal . 
of particular importance be the study of the action of drug in this respect . 
although no drug act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it , there be sufficient specificity to distinguish drug which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance . 
the former comprise analeptic and psychoactive_drug , the latter the tranquilizer . 
specific difference exist in the action of different drug belong_to the same group as , for_instance , between reserpine and chlorpromazine . 
important as these difference be , they should not obscure the basic fact that by shift the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the parasympathetic side , we produce depression , whereas a shift in the opposite direction cause excitatory effect and , eventually , maniclike change . 
the emotional_state produce by drug influence the cortical_potential in a characteristic manner ; synchrony prevail in the eeg of the experimental animal after administration of tranquilizer , but asynchrony after application of analeptic and psychoactive_drug . 
the shock_therapy act likewise on the hypothalamic balance . 
physiological experiment and clinical observation have show that these procedure influence the hypothalamically controlled hypophyseal secretion and increase sympathetic discharge . 
they shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side . 
this explain the beneficial effect of electroshock_therapy in certain depression and a shift in the reaction from hypo - to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as show by the mecholyl_test . 
some investigator have find a parallelism between remission and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicate by the mecholyl_test and , conversely , between clinical impairment and increasing deviation of this test from the norm . 
nevertheless , the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance have a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patient has not_yet been test on an adequate number of patient . 
the mecholyl and noradrenaline test apply with certain precaution be reliable indicator of this central autonomic balance , but for the sake of correlate autonomic and clinical state , and of study the effect of certain therapeutic procedure on central autonomic reaction , additional test seem to be desirable . 
it was assume that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occur spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patient from the application of certain therapeutic procedure follow the pattern know from the sleep wakefulness cycle . 
a change in the balance to the parasympathetic side lead in the normal individual to sleep or , in special circumstance , to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting . 
in both condition the emotional and perceptual sensitivity be diminished , but no depression occur such_as is see clinically or may be produce in normal person by drug . 
the fundamental difference between physiological and pathological state of parasympathetic ( and also of sympathetic ) dominance remain to be elucidate . 
perhaps a clue to these and related problem lie_in the fact that change in the intensity of hypothalamic discharge which are associate with change in its balance lead also to qualitative alteration in reactivity . 
a state of parasympathetic `` tuning '' of the hypothalamus induce experimentally cause not_only an increase in the parasympathetic reactivity this structure to direct and reflexly induce stimulus , but lead also to an autonomic reversal : a stimulus act sympathetically under control_condition elicit in this state of tuning a parasympathetic response ! 
furthermore , conditioned_reaction are fundamentally alter when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is augment beyond a critical level , and several type of behavioral change probably related_to the degree of central autonomic `` tuning '' are observe . 
if , for_instance , such a change is produced by one or a_few insulin coma or electroshock , previously inhibited conditioned_reaction reappear . 
however , if these procedure are apply more often , conditioned_response emotional response are temporarily abolish . 
in other study , loss of differentiation in previously established conditioned_reflex result from repeated convulsive ( metrazol ) treatment , suggest a fundamental disturbance in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral process . 
it has further been show that : ( 1 ) an experimental neurosis in its initial stage is associate with a reversible shift in the central autonomic balance ; ( 2 ) drug alter the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned_reaction ; ( 3 ) in a state of depression , the positive conditioned_stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned_reaction but cause an increased synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing ( alerting ) effect on the eeg . 
these be few and seemingly disjointed data , but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alteration in conditioned_reaction occur in a variety of state in which the hypothalamic balance has been alter by physiological experimentation , pharmacological action , or clinical process . 
the foregoing remark imply that the hypothalamic balance play a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological form of emotion . 
if this be the case , one would expect that not_only the various procedure just mention which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional_state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise . 
we point_out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic_disorder and neurotic symptom , particularly in certain type of personality , but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion ( `` abreaction '' ) may cure a battle neurosis . 
this phenomenon raise the question whether the guidance of the emotion for therapeutic end may_not have an even wide application in the area of the neurosis . 
be a strictly physiological procedure , one may expect from such a study additional information on the nature of the emotional process itself . 
person 's experiment and therapeutic work lie_in this area . 
he show convincingly that anxiety be a learned_reaction ( conditioned_reaction and be the basis of experimental and clinical neurosis and assume , therefore , that the neuronal change which underlie the neurosis be functional and reversible . 
an important observation of person serve as a guidepost to achieve such a reversibility by physiological means . 
in a conditioning experiment , he demonstrate the antagonism between feeding and pain . 
a mild electrical_shock serve as a conditioned_stimulus and was follow by feeding . 
the pain become thus the symbol for food and elicit salivary secretion ( conditioned_reflex ) . 
even when the intensity of the shock was increase gradually , it fail to evoke any sign of pain . 
since strong nociceptive stimulus produce an experimental neurosis during which the animal fail to eat in the experimental situation , person think that he could utilize the feeding pain antagonism to inhibit the neurotic symptom through feeding . 
appropriate experiment show that this be , indeed , possible . 
he then apply this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neurosis . 
he take advantage of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness and anxiety and find a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former attitude was establish . 
for the interpretation of these significant investigation , it should be remember that reciprocal relation exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic function which are closely associate with the emotion . 
the feeding pain antagonism seem to be based on this reciprocal relation between the trophotropic - and ergotropic system . 
furthermore , a functional antagonism exist between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety . 
although in both emotion sympathetic symptom be present , different autonomic somatic pattern underlie aggression and anxiety , respectively , as indicate by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamine , the state of the muscle_tone , and the mecholyl_test . 
the psychological incompatibility of these emotional_state seem to be reflect in , or base on , this marked difference . 
in our attempt to interpret the emotion in their physiological and pathological range , we emphasize the importance of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic division of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory system , respectively . 
we stress the reciprocal relation of these system with respect to the autonomic somatic downward discharge as_well_as regard the hypothalamic cortical discharge . 
although we be still far from a complete understanding of these problem , as a first approximation , it is suggest that alteration in the hypothalamic balance with consequent change in the hypothalamic cortical discharge account_for major change in behavior see in various mood and state of emotion in man and beast under physiological circumstance , in experimental and clinical neurosis , and as the result of psychopharmacological agent . 
in_view_of the important role which emotional_disturbance play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorder and the parallelism observe between autonomic state and psychological behavior in several instance , it is further suggest that a hypothalamic imbalance may play an important role in initiate mental change . 
we are try to study a linear_operator t on the finite dimensional space v , by decompose t into a direct_sum of operator which be in some sense elementary . 
we can do this through the characteristic value and vector of t in certain special case , i.e. , when the minimal polynomial for t factor over the scalar_field f into a product of distinct monic_polynomial of degree 1 . 
what can we do with the general t ? 
if we try to study t use characteristic value , we are confront with two problem . 
first , t may not have a single characteristic value ; this be really a deficiency in the scalar_field , namely , that it be not algebraically closed . 
second , even if the characteristic polynomial factor completely over f into a product of polynomial of degree 1 , there may not be enough characteristic vector for t to span the space v ; this be clearly a deficiency in t . 
the second situation is illustrate by the operator t on * * f ( f any field ) represent in the standard basis by * * f . 
the characteristic polynomial for a be * * f and this be plainly also the minimal polynomial for a ( or for t ) . 
thus t be not diagonalizable . 
one see that this happen because the null_space of * * f have dimension 1 only . 
on_the_other_hand , the null_space of * * f and the null_space of * * f together span v , the former be the subspace span by * * f and the latter the subspace span by * * f and * * f . 
this will be more_or_less our general method for the second problem . 
if ( remember this be an assumption ) the minimal polynomial for t decompose * * f where * * f be distinct element of f , then we shall show that the space v be the direct_sum of the null_space of * * f . 
the diagonalizable operator be the special case of this in which * * f for each i . 
the theorem which we prove be more general than what we have describe , since it work with the primary decomposition of the minimal polynomial , whether or not the prime which enter be all of first degree . 
the reader will find it helpful to think_of the special case when the prime be of degree 1 , and even more particularly , to think_of the proof of theorem 10 , a special case of this theorem . 
let t be a linear_operator on the finite dimensional vector space v over the field f . 
let p be the minimal polynomial for t , * * f where the * * f be distinct irreducible monic_polynomial over f and the * * f be positive integer . 
let * * f be the null_space of * * f . 
then ( a ) * * f ( b ) each * * f be invariant under t ( c ) if * * f be the operator induce on * * f by t , then the minimal polynomial for * * f be * * f . 
the idea of the proof be this . 
if the direct_sum decomposition ( a ) be valid , how can we get hold of the projection * * f associate with the decomposition ? 
the projection * * f will be the identity on * * f and zero on the other * * f . 
we shall find a polynomial * * f such_that * * f be the identity on * * f and be zero on the other * * f , and so that * * f , etc. . 
for each i , let * * f . 
since * * f be distinct prime polynomial , the polynomial * * f be relatively prime ( theorem 8 , chapter 4 ) . 
thus there be polynomial * * f such_that * * f . 
note also that if * * f , then * * f be divisible_by the polynomial p , because * * f contain each * * f as a factor . 
we shall show that the polynomial * * f behave in the manner describe in the first paragraph of the proof . 
let * * f . 
since * * f and p divide * * f for * * f , we have * * f . 
thus the * * f be projection which correspond to some direct_sum decomposition of the space v . 
we wish to show that the range of * * f be exactly the subspace * * f . 
it is clear that each vector in the range of * * f be in * * f for if |a be in the range of * * f , then * * f and so * * f because * * f be divisible_by the minimal polynomial p . 
conversely , suppose that |a be in the null_space of * * f . 
if * * f , then * * f be divisible_by * * f and so * * f , i.e. , * * f . 
but then it be immediate that * * f , i.e. , that |a be in the range of * * f . 
this complete the proof of statement ( a ) . 
it be certainly clear that the subspace * * f be invariant under t . 
if * * f be the operator induce on * * f by t , then evidently * * f , because by definition * * f be 0 on the subspace * * f . 
this show that the minimal polynomial for * * f divide * * f . 
conversely , let g be any polynomial such_that * * f . 
then * * f . 
thus * * f be divisible_by the minimal polynomial p of t , i.e. , * * f divide * * f . 
it is easily see that * * f divide g . 
hence the minimal polynomial for * * f be * * f . 
if * * f be the projection associate with the primary decomposition of t , then each * * f be a polynomial in t , and accordingly if a linear_operator u commute with t then u commute with each of the * * f i.e. , each subspace * * f be invariant under u . 
in the notation of the proof of theorem 12 , let us take_a_look at the special case in which the minimal polynomial for t be a product of first degree polynomial , i.e. , the case in which each * * f be of the form * * f . 
now the range of * * f be the null_space * * f of * * f . 
let us put * * f . 
by theorem 10 , d be a diagonalizable operator which we shall call the diagonalizable part of t . 
let us look_at the operator * * f . 
now * * f * * f so * * f . 
the reader should be familiar_with enough with projection by now so that he see that * * f and in_general that * * f . 
when * * f for each i , we shall have * * f , because the operator * * f will then be 0 on the range of * * f . 
let n be a linear_operator on the vector space v . 
we say that n be nilpotent if there be some positive integer r such_that * * f . 
let t be a linear_operator on the finite dimensional vector space v over the field f . 
suppose that the minimal polynomial for t decompose over f into a product of linear polynomial . 
then there be a diagonalizable operator d on v and a nilpotent operator n on v such_that ( a ) * * f , ( b ) * * f . 
the diagonalizable operator d and the nilpotent operator n are uniquely determine by ( a ) and ( b ) and each of them be a polynomial in t . 
we have just observe that we can write * * f where d be diagonalizable and n be nilpotent , and where d and n not_only commute but be polynomial in t . 
now suppose that we also have * * f where d ' be diagonalizable , n ' be nilpotent , and * * f . 
we shall prove that * * f . 
since d ' and n ' commute with one another and * * f , we see that d ' and n ' commute with t . 
thus d ' and n ' commute with any polynomial in t ; hence they commute with d and with n . 
now we have * * f or * * f and all four of these operator commute with one another . 
since d and d ' be both diagonalizable and they commute , they be simultaneously diagonalizable , and * * f be diagonalizable . 
since n and n ' be both nilpotent and they commute , the operator * * f be nilpotent ; for , use the fact that n and n ' commute * * f and so when r be sufficiently large every term in this expression for * * f will be 0 . 
( actually , a nilpotent operator on an n-dimensional space must have its nth power 0 ; if we take * * f above , that will be large enough . 
it then follow that * * f be large enough , but this be not obvious from the above expression . ) 
now * * f be a diagonalizable operator which be also nilpotent . 
such an operator be obviously the zero operator ; for since it be nilpotent , the minimal polynomial for this operator be of the form * * f for some * * f ; but then since the operator be diagonalizable , the minimal polynomial cannot have a repeated root ; hence * * f and the minimal polynomial be simply x , which say the operator be 0 . 
thus we see that * * f and * * f . 
let v be a finite dimensional vector space over an algebraically closed field f , e.g. , the field of complex_number . 
then every linear_operator t on v can be write as the sum of a diagonalizable operator d and a nilpotent operator n which commute . 
these operator d and n be unique and each be a polynomial in t . 
from these result , one see that the study of linear_operator on vector space over an algebraically closed field is essentially reduce to the study of nilpotent operator . 
for vector space over non algebraically closed field , we still need to find some substitute for characteristic value and vector . 
it be a very interesting fact that these two problem can be handle simultaneously and this be what we shall do in the next chapter . 
in conclude this section , we should_like to give an example which illustrate some of the idea of the primary decomposition theorem . 
we have choose to give it at the end of the section since it deal with differential_equation and thus be not purely linear_algebra . 
in the primary decomposition theorem , it be not necessary that the vector space v be finite dimensional , nor be it necessary for part ( a ) and ( b ) that p be the minimal polynomial for t . 
if t be a linear_operator on an arbitrary vector space and if there be a monic_polynomial p such_that * * f , then part ( a ) and ( b ) of theorem 12 be valid for t with the proof which we give . 
let n be a positive integer and let v be the space of all n times continuously differentiable function f on the real line which satisfy the differential_equation * * f where * * f be some fixed constant . 
if * * f denote the space of n times continuously differentiable function , then the space v of solution of this differential_equation be a subspace of * * f . 
if d denote the differentiation operator and p be the polynomial * * f then v be the null_space of the operator p ( d ) , because * * f simply say * * f . 
let us now regard d as a linear_operator on the subspace v . 
then * * f . 
if we are discuss differentiable complex valued function , then * * f and v be complex vector space , and * * f may be any complex_number . 
we now write * * f where * * f be distinct complex_number . 
if * * f be the null_space of * * f , then theorem 12 say that * * f . 
in_other_words , if f satisfy the differential_equation * * f , then f be uniquely expressible in the form * * f where * * f satisfy the differential_equation * * f . 
thus , the study of the solution to the equation * * f is reduce to the study of the space of solution of a differential_equation of the form * * f . 
this reduction has been accomplish by the general method of linear_algebra , i.e. , by the primary decomposition theorem . 
to describe the space of solution to * * f , one must know something about differential_equation , that_is , one must know something about d other_than the fact that it be a linear_operator . 
however , one does not need to know very_much . 
it be very easy to establish by induction on r that if f be in * * f then * * f that_is , * * f , etc. . 
thus * * f if and only if * * f . 
a function g such_that * * f , i.e. , * * f , must be a polynomial function of degree * * f or less : * * f . 
thus f satisfy * * f if and only if f have the form * * f . 
accordingly , the ' function ' * * f span the space of solution of * * f . 
since * * f be linearly independent function and the exponential_function have no zero , these r function * * f , form a basis for the space of solution . 
some experiment be composed of repetition of independent trial , each with two possible outcome . 
the binomial_distribution probability distribution may describe the variation that occur from one set of trial of such a binomial experiment to another . 
we devote a chapter to the binomial_distribution not_only because it be a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real_life phenomenon , but also because it have important property that recur in many other probability model . 
we begin with a_few example of binomial experiment . 
a trained marksman shoot five round at a target , all under practically the same condition , may hit the bull's_eye from 0 to 5 time . 
in repeat set of five shot his number of bull's_eye vary . 
what can we say of the probability of the different possible number of bull's_eye ? 
in litter of eight mouse from similar parent , the number of mouse with straight instead of wavy hair be an integer from 0 to 8 . 
what probability should be attach to these possible outcome ? 
when three dice are toss repeatedly , what be the probability that the number of ace be 0 ( or 1 , or 2 , or 3 ) ? 
more generally , suppose that an experiment consist_of a number of independent trial , that each trial result in either a `` success '' or a `` non success '' ( `` failure '' ) , and that the probability of success remain constant from trial to trial . 
in the example above , the occurrence of a bull's_eye , a straight haired mouse , or an ace could be call a `` success '' . 
in_general , any outcome we choose may be label `` success '' . 
the major question in this chapter be : what be the probability of exactly x success in n trial ? 
in chapter 3 and 4 we answer question like those in the example , usually by count point in a sample space . 
fortunately , a general formula of wide applicability solve all problem of this kind . 
before derive this formula , we explain what we mean by `` problem of this kind '' . 
experiment are often compose of several identical trial , and sometimes experiment themselves are repeat . 
in the marksmanship example , a trial consist_of `` one round shoot at a target '' with outcome either one bull's_eye ( success ) or none ( failure ) . 
further , an experiment might consist_of five round , and several set of five round might be regard_as a super experiment compose of several repetition of the five round experiment . 
if three dice are toss , a trial be one toss of one die and the experiment is composed of three trial . 
or , what amount to the same thing , if one die is toss three time , each toss be a trial , and the three toss form the experiment . 
mathematically , we shall not distinguish the experiment of three dice toss once from that of one die toss three time . 
these example be illustrative of the use of the word `` trial '' and `` experiment '' as they are use in this chapter , but they be quite flexible word and it be well not to restrict them too narrowly . 
ten student act_as manager for a high_school football_team , and of these manager a proportion p be licensed driver . 
each friday one manager is choose by lot to stay late and load the equipment on a truck . 
on three friday the coach has need a driver . 
consider only these friday , what be the probability that the coach have driver all 3 time ? 
exactly 2 time ? 
1 time ? 
0 time ? 
note that there be 3 trial of interest . 
each trial consist_of choose a student manager at_random . 
the 2 possible outcome on each trial be `` driver '' or `` nondriver '' . 
since the choice be by lot each_week , the outcome of different trial be independent . 
the manager stay the same , so that * * f be the same for all week . 
we now generalize these idea for general binomial experiment . 
for an experiment to qualify as a binomial experiment , it must have four property : ( 1 ) there must be a fixed number of trial , ( 2 ) each trial must result in a `` success '' or a `` failure '' ( a binomial trial ) , ( 3 ) all trial must have identical probability of success , ( 4 ) the trial must be independent of each other . 
below we use our earlier example to describe and illustrate these four property . 
we also give , for each property , an example where the property be absent . 
the language and notation introduce be standard throughout the chapter . 
for the marksman , we study set of five shot ( * * f ) ; for the mouse , we restrict attention to litter of eight ( * * f ) ; and for the ace , we toss three dice ( * * f ) . 
toss a die until an ace appear . 
here the number of trial be a random_variable , not a fixed number . 
each of the n trial be either a success or a failure . 
`` success '' and `` failure '' be just convenient label for the two category of outcome when we talk_about binomial trial in_general . 
these word be more expressive than label like `` a '' and `` not - a '' . 
it be natural from the marksman 's viewpoint to call a bull's_eye a success , but in the mouse example it be arbitrary which category correspond to straight hair in a mouse . 
the word `` binomial '' mean `` of two name '' or `` of two term '' , and both usage apply in our work : the first to the name of the two outcome of a binomial trial , and the second to the term p and * * f that represent the probability of `` success '' and `` failure '' . 
sometimes when there be many outcome for a single trial , we group these outcome into two class , as in the example of the die , where we have arbitrarily construct the class `` ace '' and `` not ace '' . 
we classify mouse as `` straight haired '' or `` wavy haired '' , but a hairless mouse appear . 
we can escape_from such a difficulty by rule_out the animal as not constitute a trial , but such a solution be not always satisfactory . 
each die have probability * * f of produce an ace ; the marksman have some probability p , perhaps 0.1 , of make a bull's_eye . 
note that we need not know the value of p , for the experiment to be binomial . 
during a round of target_practice the sun come from behind a cloud and dazzle the marksman , lower his chance of a bull's_eye . 
strictly_speaking , this mean that the probability for each possible outcome of the experiment can be compute by multiply together the probability of the possible outcome of the single binomial trial . 
thus in the three dice example * * f , * * f , and the independence assumption imply that the probability that the three dice fall ace , not ace , ace in that order be ( 1 6 ) ( 5 6 ) ( 1 6 ) . 
experimentally , we expect independence when the trial have nothing to do with one another . 
a family of five plan to go together either to the beach or to the mountain , and a coin is toss to decide . 
we want to know the number of people go_to the mountain . 
when this experiment is view_as compose of five binomial trial , one for each member of the family , the outcome of the trial be obviously not independent . 
indeed , the experiment is better view_as consist_of one binomial trial for the entire family . 
the following be a less extreme example of dependence . 
consider couple visit an art museum . 
each person vote for one of a pair of picture to receive a popular prize . 
vote for one picture may be call `` success '' , for the other `` failure '' . 
an experiment consist_of the voting of one couple , or two trial . 
in repetition of the experiment from couple to couple , the vote of the two person in a couple probably agree more often than independence would imply , because couple who visit the museum together be more likely to have similar taste than be a random pair of people draw from the entire population of visitor . 
table 7 - 1 illustrate the point . 
the table show that 0.6 of the boy and 0.6 of the girl vote for picture a . 
therefore , under independent voting , * * f or 0.36 of the couple would cast two vote for picture a , and * * f or 0.16 would cast two vote for picture b . 
thus in independent voting , * * f or 0.52 of the couple would agree . 
but table 7 - 1 show that * * f or 0.70 agree , too many for independent voting . 
each performance of an n-trial binomial experiment result in some whole_number from 0 through n as the value of the random_variable x , where * * f . 
we want to study the probability function of this random_variable . 
for_example , we be interested in the number of bull's_eye , not which shot be bull's_eye . 
a binomial experiment can produce random_variable other_than the number of success . 
for_example , the marksman get 5 shot , but we take his score to be the number of shot before his first bull's_eye , that_is , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ( or 5 , if he get no bull's_eye ) . 
thus we do not score the number of bull's_eye , and the random_variable be not the number of success . 
the constancy of p and the independence be the condition most likely to give trouble in_practice . 
obviously , very slight change in p do not change the probability much , and a slight lack of independence may not make an appreciable difference . 
( for_instance , see example 2 of section 5 - 5 , on red card in hand of 5 . ) 
on_the_other_hand , even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical_phenomenon being study , the binomial model may still be use as a baseline for comparative purpose ; that_is , we may discuss the phenomenon in_terms_of its departure from the binomial model . 
a binomial experiment consist_of * * f independent binomial trial , all with the same probability * * f of yield a success . 
the outcome of the experiment be x success . 
the random_variable x take the value * * f with probability * * f or , more briefly * * f . 
we shall find a formula for the probability of exactly x success for given value of p and n . 
when each number of success x is pair with its probability of occurrence * * f , the set of pair * * f , be a probability function called a binomial_distribution . 
the choice of p and n determine the binomial_distribution uniquely , and different choice always produce different distribution ( except when * * f ; then the number of success be always 0 ) . 
the set of all binomial_distribution is call the family of binomial_distribution , but in general discussion this expression is often shorten to `` the binomial_distribution '' , or even `` the binomial '' when the context be clear . 
binomial_distribution were treat by person about 1700 , and for this reason binomial trial are sometimes called person trial . 
each binomial trial of a binomial experiment produce either 0 or 1 success . 
therefore each binomial trial can be think_of as produce a value of a random_variable associate with that trial and take the value 0 and 1 , with probability q and p respectively . 
the several trial of a binomial experiment produce a new random_variable x , the total number of success , which be just the sum of the random_variable associate with the single trial . 
the marksman get two bull's_eye , one on his third shot and one on his fifth . 
the number of success on the five individual shot be , then , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 . 
the number of success on each shot be a value of a random_variable that have value 0 or 1 , and there be 5 such random_variable here . 
their sum be x , the total number of success , which in this experiment have the value * * f . 
consider a simple , closed , plane curve c which be a real analytic image of the unit circle , and which is give by **f . 
these be real analytic periodic function with period t . 
in the following paper it is show that in a certain definite sense , exactly an odd number of square can be inscribe in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed square . 
this theorem be similar to the theorem of person that there exist a circumscribe cube around any closed , bounded convex set in **f . 
the latter theorem has been generalize by person and person , and person to show that in **f there be family of such cube . 
here , for the case of square inscribed in plane curve , we remove the restriction to convexity and give certain other result . 
a square inscribed in a curve c mean a square with its four corner point on the curve , though it may_not lie entirely in the interior of c . 
indeed , the spiral **f , with the two endpoint connected by a straight_line possess only one inscribed square . 
the square have one corner point on the straight_line segment , and does not lie entirely in the interior . 
on c , from the point p at **f to the point q at **f , we construct the chord , and upon the chord as a side erect a square in such a way that as s approach zero the square be inside c . 
as s increase we consider the two free corner point of the square , **f and **f , adjacent to p and q respectively . 
as s approach t the square will be outside c and therefore both **f and **f must cross c an odd number of time as s vary from zero to t . 
the point may also touch c without cross . 
suppose **f cross c when **f . 
we now have certain square with three corner on c . 
for any such square the middle corner of these will be call the vertex of the square and the corner not on the curve will be call the diagonal point of the square . 
each point on c , as a vertex , may possess a finite number of corresponding diagonal point by the above construction . 
to each paired vertex and diagonal point there correspond a unique forward corner point , i.e. , the corner on c reach first by proceed along c from the vertex in the direction of increasing t . 
if the vertex be at **f , and if the interior of c be on the left as one move in the direction of increasing t , then every such corner can be find from the curve obtain by rotate c clockwise through 90 ` about the vertex . 
the set of intersection of **f , the rotated curve , with the original curve c consist_of just the set of forward corner point on c correspond to the vertex at **f , plus the vertex itself . 
we note that two such curve c and **f , cannot coincide at more_than a finite number of point ; otherwise , be analytic , they would coincide at all point , which be impossible since they do not coincide near **f . 
with each vertex we associate certain numerical value , namely the set of positive difference in the parameter t between the vertex and its corresponding forward corner point . 
for the vertex at **f , these value will be denote by **f . 
the function f ( t ) define in this way be multi valued . 
we consider now the graph of the function f ( t ) on **f . 
we will refer to the plane of c and **f as the c-plane and to the plane of the graph as the f-plane . 
the graph , as a set , may have a finite number of component . 
we will denote the value of f ( t ) on different component by **f . 
each point with abscissa t on the graph represent an intersection between c and **f . 
there be two type of such intersection , depend essentially on whether the curve cross at the point_of_intersection . 
an ordinary point will be any point_of_intersection a such_that in every neighborhood of a in the c-plane , **f meet both the interior and the exterior of c . 
any other point_of_intersection between c and **f will be call a tangent point . 
this terminology will also be apply to the corresponding point in the f-plane . 
we can now prove several lemma . 
in some neighborhood in the f-plane of any ordinary point of the graph , the function f be a single valued , continuous function . 
we first show that the function be single valued in some neighborhood . 
with the vertex at **f in the c-plane we assume that **f be the parametric location on c of an ordinary intersection q between c and **f . 
in the f-plane the coordinate of the corresponding point be **f . 
we know that in the c-plane both c and **f be analytic . 
in the c-plane we construct a set of rectangular cartesian coordinate u , v with the origin at q and such_that both c and **f have finite slope at q . 
near q , both curve can be represent by analytic function of u . 
in a neighborhood of q the difference between these function be also a single valued , analytic function of u . 
furthermore , one can find a neighborhood of q in which the difference function be monotone , for since it be analytic it can have only a finite number of extremum in any interval . 
now , to find **f , one needs the intersection of c and **f near q . 
but **f be just the curve **f translate without rotation through a small arc , for **f is always obtain by rotate c through exactly 90 ` . 
the arc be itself a segment of an analytic curve . 
thus if e be sufficiently small , there can be only one intersection of c and **f near q , for if there be more than one intersection for every e then the difference between c and **f near q would not be a monotone function . 
therefore , **f be single valued near q . 
it is also see that **f , since the change from **f to **f is accomplish by a continuous translation . 
thus **f be also continuous at **f , and in a neighborhood of **f which does not contain a tangent point . 
we turn now to the set of tangent point on the graph . 
this set must consist_of isolated point and closed_interval . 
the fact that there can not be any limit_point of the set except in closed_interval follow from the argument use in lemma 1 , namely , that near any tangent point in the c-plane the curve c and **f be analytic , and therefore the difference between them must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point . 
this prevent the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent point . 
in some neighborhood of an isolated tangent point in the f-plane , say **f , the function **f be either double valued or have no value define , except at the tangent point itself , where it be single valued . 
a tangent point q in the c-plane occur when c and **f be tangent to one another . 
a continuous change in t through an amount e result in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve **f . 
there be three possibility : ( a ) **f remain tangent to c as it is translate ; ( b ) **f move away from c and does not intersect it at_all for **f ; ( c ) **f cut_across c and there be two ordinary intersection for every t in **f . 
the first possibility result in a closed_interval of tangent point in the f-plane , the end_point of which fall_into category ( b ) or ( c ) . 
in the second category the function **f have no value define in a neighborhood **f . 
in the third category the function be double valued in this interval . 
the same remark apply to an interval on the other side of **f . 
again , the analyticity of the two curve guarantee that such interval exist . 
in the neighborhood of an end_point of an interval of tangent point in the f-plane the function be two valued or no valued on one side , and be a single valued function consist_of entirely of tangent point on the other side . 
with the above result we can make the following remark about the graph of f . 
first , for any value of t for which all value of f ( t ) be ordinary point the number of value of f ( t ) must be odd . 
for it be clear that the total number of ordinary intersection of c and **f must be even ( otherwise , start in the interior of c , **f could not finally return to the interior ) , and the center of rotation at t be the argument of the function , not a value . 
therefore , for any value of t the number of value of f ( t ) be equal to the ( finite ) number of tangent point correspond to the argument t plus an odd number . 
the number of ordinary value of the function f ( t ) at t will be call its multiplicity at t . 
the graph of f have at_least one component whose support be the entire interval [ 0 , t ] . 
we suppose not . 
then every component of the graph of f must be define over a bounded sub-interval . 
suppose **f is define in the sub-interval **f . 
now **f and **f must both be tangent point on the nth component in the f-plane ; otherwise by lemma 1 the component would extend beyond these point . 
further , we see by lemma 2 that the multiplicity of f can only change at a tangent point , and at such a point can only change by an even integer . 
thus the multiplicity of **f for a given t must be an even number . 
this be true of all component which have such a bounded support . 
but this be a contradiction , for we know that the multiplicity of f ( t ) be odd for every t . 
we have show that the graph of f contain at_least one component whose inverse be the entire interval [ 0 , t ] , and whose multiplicity be odd . 
there must be an odd number of such component , which will be call complete component . 
the remaining ( incomplete ) component all have an even number of ordinary point at any argument , and are define only on a proper sub-interval of [ 0 , t ] . 
we must now show that on some component of the graph there exist two point for which the corresponding diagonal point in the c-plane be on opposite side of c . 
we again consider a fixed point p at **f and a variable point q at **f on c . 
we erect a square with pq as a side and with free corner **f and **f adjacent to p and q respectively . 
as s vary from zero to t , the value of s for which **f and **f cross c will be denote by **f and **f respectively . 
we have **f , plus tangent point . 
these s-values be just the ordinary value of **f . 
the value **f be the ordinary value at **f of a multi valued function g ( t ) which have component correspond to those of f ( t ) . 
we first define a function b ( t ) as_follows : given the set of square such_that each have three corner on c and vertex at t , b ( t ) be the corresponding set of positive parametric difference between t and the backward corner point . 
the function f and b have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument t . 
now with p fixed at **f , **f-values occur when the corner **f cross c , and be among the value of s such_that **f . 
the root of this equation be just the ordinate of the intersection of the graph of b with a straight_line of unit slope through **f in the b-plane ( the plane of the graph of b ) . 
we define these value as **f , and define g ( t ) in the same way for each t . 
thus we obtain g ( t ) by introduce an oblique g ( t ) - axis in the b-plane . 
these society can expect to face difficult time . 
as the historic process of modernization gradually gain momentum , their cohesion will be threaten by divisive force , the gap between ruler and subject , town and country , will widen ; new aspirant for power will emerge whose ambition far exceed their competence ; old ruler may lose their nerve and their sense_of_direction . 
national_leader will have_to display the highest skill of statesmanship to guide their people through time of uncertainty and confusion which destroy man 's sense of identity . 
feeling of a community of interest will have_to be recreate - in some of the new nation , indeed , they must be build for_the_first_time - on a new basis which look toward the future and does not rely_on only on shared memory of the past . 
nevertheless , with foresight and careful planning , some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequence of social change which have trouble other country pass_through this stage can be escape . 
the united_states can help by communicate a genuine concern with the problem these country face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate form of assistance where possible . 
our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these society to tackle boldly the task which they face . 
at_the_same_time , we should recognize that the obstacle to change and the lack of cohesion and stability which characterize these country may make them particularly prone to diversion and external adventure of all sort . 
it may seem to some of them that success can be purchase much less dearly by fish in the murky water of international politics than by face_up to the intractable task at_home . 
we should do what we can to discourage this conclusion , both by offer assistance for their domestic need and by react firmly to irresponsible action on the world scene . 
when necessary , we should make it clear that country which choose to derive marginal advantage from the cold_war or to exploit their potential for disrupt the security of the world will not_only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospect for orderly development . 
as a nation , we feel an obligation to assist other country in their development ; but this obligation pertain only to country which are honestly seek to become responsible member of a stable and forward-moving world community . 
when we look_at country like iran , iraq , pakistan , and burma , where substantial progress has been make in create a minimum supply of modern_man and of social overhead capital , and where institution of centralized government exist , we find a second category of country with a different set of problem and hence different priority for policy . 
the man in power are commit in_principle to modernization , but economic and social change are proceed only erratically . 
isolated enterprise have been launch , but they are not_yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern . 
the society be likely to be characterize by have a fairly modernized urban sector and a relatively untouched rural sector , with very poor communication between the two . 
progress is impede by psychological inhibition to effective action among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resource , human and material , can be mobilize to achieve the national goal of modernization already symbolically accept . 
most country in this second category share the difficulty of have many of the structure of a modern political and social_system without the modern standard of performance require to make them effective . 
in these rapidly changing society there be also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goal . 
the colonial period has generally leave people believe that government can , if it wish , provide all manner of service for them - and that with independence freeman do not have_to work to realize the benefit of modern life . 
for_example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most transitional society have announce economic development plan of vary number of year ; such be the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement . 
the civil_service in such society be generally inadequate to deal competently with the problem face them ; and their member often equate a government career with security and status rather_than with sacrifice , self-discipline , and competence . 
american policy should press constantly the view that until these government demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracy there be not the slight hope that they will either modernize of democratize their society . 
we should spread the view that planning and national development be serious matter which call_for effort as_well_as enthusiasm . 
above_all , we should seek to encourage the leader of these society to accept the unpleasant fact that they be responsible_for their fate . 
only within the framework of a mature relationship characterize by honest appraisal of performance can we provide telling assistance . 
with_respect_to those country whose leader prefer to live with their illusion , we can afford to wait , for in_time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all to see . 
our technical assistance to these country should place special emphasis on induce the central government to assume the role of advisor and guide which at an earlier stage foreign expert assume in deal with the central government . 
we should encourage the government to develop their own technical assistance to community , state and provincial government , rural community , and other smaller group , make certain that no important segment of the economy is neglect . 
simultaneously we should be underline the interrelationship of technical progress in various field , show how agricultural training can be introduce into education , how health affect labor productivity , how small business can benefit the rural farm community , and , above_all , how progress in each field relate to national progress . 
effort such_as the group in the location have demonstrate that transitional society can work toward balanced national development . 
to achieve this goal of balanced development , communication between the central government and the local community must be such_that the need and aspiration of the people themselves are effectively take_into_account . 
if modernization program are impose from above , without the understanding and cooperation of the people , they will encounter grave difficulty . 
land_reform be likely to be a pressing issue in many of these country . 
it should be american policy not_only to encourage effective land_reform program but also to underline the relation of such reform to the economic growth and modernization of the society . 
as an isolated policy , land_reform be likely to be politically disruptive ; as part of a large development effort , however , it may gain wide acceptance . 
it should also be recognize that the problem of rural tenancy cannot be solve by administrative decree alone . 
land_reform program need to be supplement with program for promote rural credit and technical assistance in agriculture . 
lastly , governmental and private planner will at this stage begin to see large capital requirement loom ahead . 
by hold_out prospect for external capital assistance , the united_states can provide strong incentive to prepare_for the concerted economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth . 
at a third stage in the modernization process be such country as india , brazil , the philippines , and taiwan , which be ready and commit to move_into the stage of self-sustaining growth . 
they must continue to satisfy basic capital need ; and there persist the dual problem of maintain operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralize participation in the program to wide and wide group . 
but these country have make big stride toward develop the necessary human and social overhead capital ; they have establish reasonably stable and effective governmental institution at national and local level ; and they have begin to develop a capacity to deal realistically and simultaneously with all the major sector of their economy . 
on the economic front , the first priority of these country be to mobilize a vastly increased volume of resource . 
several related task must be carry_out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieve . 
these country must formulate a comprehensive , long-term program cover the objective of both the private and the public sector of the economy . 
they must in their planning be able to count_on at_least tentative commitment of foreign capital assistance over period of several year . 
capital import draw from a number of source must be employ and combine skillfully enough to permit domestic investment programming to go_forward . 
capital flow must be coordinate with national need and planning . 
finally , a balance must be effect among project finance , utilization of agricultural surplus , and general balance_of_payments support . 
thus , although the agenda of external assistance in the economic sphere be cumulative , and many_of the policy suggest for nation in the early stage remain relevant , the basic purpose of american economic_policy during the later stage of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining growth is not prevent by lack of foreign_exchange . 
there remain many political and administrative problem to be solve . 
for_one_thing , although considerable number of men have been train , bureaucracy be still deficient in many respect ; even the famed group be not fully adequate_to the tremendous range of task it has undertake . 
technical assistance in train middle-level - and upper-level management_personnel is still need in many case . 
there be also more basic problem . 
this be the stage at which democratic development must take_place if the society is to become an open community of creative people . 
nevertheless , impulse still exist among the ruling elite to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need for centralized and authoritarian practice . 
another great danger be that the emerge middle_class will feel itself increasingly alienate from the political_leader who still justify their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism . 
the capacity of intellectual and member of the new professional class to contribute creatively to national development be likely to be destroy by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their own political class and their colleague and professional counterpart in the west . 
particularly when base upon a single dominant party , government may respond to such a situation by claim a monopoly of understanding about the national interest . 
convinced of the wisdom of their own action , and reassure by the promise of their economic development program , government may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort , become instead rigid and inflexible in their policy . 
american policy toward such society should stress our sympathy for the emerge social and professional class . 
it should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standard and an understanding of the tremendous power and potentiality of genuinely open and pluralistic society . 
we have every obligation to take seriously their claim to be democratic and free country ; we also have , in consequence , the duty to appraise realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate our judgment to their leader in frank but friendly way . 
we have emphasize that the modernizing process in each society will take a considerable period_of_time . 
with the exception of treaty make , foreign relation were historically concern for_the_most_part with condition of short or at_least measurable duration . 
foreign_policy now take_on a different perspective and must become skilled not merely at response but also at projection . 
american and free_world policy can marginally affect the pace of transition ; but basically that pace depend_on change in the supply of resource and in the human attitude , political institution , and social_structure which each society must generate . 
it follow that any effective policy toward the underdeveloped country must have a realistically long working horizon . 
it must be mark by a patience and persistence which have not always be its trademark . 
this condition affect not_only the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign_policy , especially in the context of economic aid . 
the place of religion in the simple , preliterate society be quite definite ; as a complex it fit into the whole social_organization and function dominantly in every part of_it . 
in society like ours , however , its place be less clear and more complex . 
with the diversity of religious viewpoint , there be difference_of_opinion as to the essential feature of religion ; and there be different opinion as to the essential function of religion . 
nevertheless , for most_of the population of heterogeneous advanced society , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social function . 
although the inner function of religion be not of direct significance in social_organization , they have important indirect consequence . 
if the inner function of religion are perform , the individual be a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; he be not greatly frustrated , and he be not anomic ; he be better fit to perform his social life among his fellow . 
there be several closely related inner function . 
in_the_last_analysis , religion be the means of induce , formulate , express , enhance , implement , and perpetuate man 's deep experience - the religious . 
man be first religious ; the instrumentality follow . 
religion seek to satisfy human need of great pertinence . 
the significant thing in it , at the higher religious level , be the inner emotional , mental , and spiritual occurrence that fill the pressing human need of self-preservation , self pacification , and self completion . 
the chief experience be the sensing of communion , and in the higher religion , of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural power . 
related_to this be the fact that most_of the higher religion define for the individual his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he be relatively secure in an ordered , dependable universe . 
man have the experience of being helpfully ally_with what he cannot fully understand ; he be a coordinate part of all_of the mysterious energy and being and movement . 
the universe be a safe and permanent home . 
a number of religion also satisfy for many the need of being link with the ultimate and eternal . 
death be not permanent defeat and disappearance ; man have a second chance . 
he be not lost in the abyss of endless time ; he have endless being . 
religion at its best also offer the experience of spiritual fulfillment by invite man into the highest realm of the spirit . 
religion can summate , epitomize , relate , and conserve all the highest ideal and values - ethical , aesthetic , and religious - of man form in his culture . 
there be also the possibility , among higher religion , of experience consistent meaning in life and enjoy guidance and expansiveness . 
the kind of religious experience that most modern seek not_only provide , clarify , and relate human yearning , values , ideal , and purpose ; it also provide facility and incitement for the development of personality , sociality , and creativeness . 
under the religious impulse , whether theistic or humanistic , man have joy in live ; life lead somewhere . 
religion at its best be out in_front , ever beckon and lead_on , and , as person put it , `` mobilize all man 's scattered energy in one triumphant sense of his own infinite importance '' . 
at_the_same_time that religion bind the individual helpfully to the supernatural and give him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment , it also have great therapeutic value for him . 
it give him aid , comfort , even solace , in meet mundane life situation where his own unassisted practical knowledge and skill are feel by him to be inadequate . 
he be confront with the recurrent crisis , such_as great natural catastrophe and the great transition of life - marriage , incurable disease , widowhood , old_age , the certainty of death . 
he has_to cope_with frustration and other emotional_disturbance and anomie . 
his religious_belief provide him with plausible explanation for many condition which cause him great concern , and his religious faith make possible fortitude , equanimity , and consolation , enable him to endure colossal misfortune , fear , frustration , uncertainty , suffering , evil , and danger . 
religion usually also include a principle of compensation , mainly in a promised perfect future state . 
the belief in immortality , where hold , function as a redress for the ill and disappointment of the here_and_now . 
the tension accompany a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing or sinning or some torment secret are relieve for the less self-contained or self-sufficient by confession , repentance , and penance . 
the feeling of individual inferiority , defeat , or humiliation grow out of various social situation or individual deficiency or failure is compensate for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly , but all-victorious father-god , as_well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith , and by opportunity in religious act for give_vent to emotion and energy . 
in provide for these inner individual function , religion undertake in behalf of individual peace_of_mind and well-being service for which there be no other institution . 
in_addition to the function of religion within man , there have always be the outer social function for the community and society . 
the two have never be separable . 
religion be vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and regulation . 
the value-system of a community or society is always correlated with , and to a degree dependent upon , a more_or_less shared system of religious_belief and conviction . 
the religion support , reinforce , reaffirm , and maintain the fundamental values . 
even in the united_states , with its freedom of religious_belief and worship and its vast denominational differentiation , there be a general consensus regard the basic christian values . 
this is demonstrate especially when there be awareness of radically different value_orientation elsewhere ; for_example person rally to christian values vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism . 
in america also all_of our major religious body officially sanction a universalistic ethic which be reflective of our common religion . 
even the non church_member - the freewheeler , marginal religionist and_so_on - have the values of christian civilization internalize in them . 
furthermore , religion tend to integrate the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of god to the intermediary and subordinate values ; for_example , those regard material object and pragmatic end . 
finally , it give sanctity , more than human legitimacy , and even , through super empirical reference , transcendent and supernatural importance to some values ; for_example , marriage as a sacrament , much law-breaking as sinful , occasionally the state as a divine instrument . 
it place certain values at_least beyond questioning and tampering . 
closely related to this function be the fact that the religious system provide a body of ultimate end for the society , which be compatible with the supreme eternal end . 
this something lead to a conception of an overall social plan with a meaning interpretable in_terms_of ultimate end ; for_example , a plan that fulfill the will of god , which advance the kingdom_of_god , which involve social life as part of the grand design . 
this explain some group end and provide a justification of their primacy . 
it give social guidance and direction and make_for program of social action . 
finally , it give meaning to much social endeavor , and logic , consistency , and meaning to life . 
in_general , there be no society so secularized as to be completely without religiously inspire transcendental end . 
religion integrate and unify . 
some of the oldest , most persistent , and most cohesive form of social grouping have grow out of religion . 
these group have vary widely from mere family , primitive , totemic group , and small modern cult and sect , to the membership of great denomination , and great , widely dispersed world religion . 
religion foster group life in various way . 
the common ultimate values , end and goal foster by religion be a most important factor . 
without a system of value-system there can be no society . 
where such a value-system prevail , it always unify all who possess it ; it enable member of the society to operate as a system . 
the belief of a religion also reflect the values are express in creed , dogma , and doctrine , and form what person call a credo . 
as he point_out , a religious group cannot exist without a collective credo , and the more extensive the credo , the more unified and strong be the group . 
the credo unify and socialize man by attach them completely to an identical body of doctrine ; the more extensive and firm the body of doctrine , the firm the group . 
the religious symbolism , and especially the closely related rite and worship form , constitute a powerful bond for the member of the particular faith . 
the religion , in_fact , be an expression of the unity of the group , small or large . 
the common code , for religious action as_such and in their ethical aspect for everyday moral behavior , bind the devotee together . 
these be way of jointly participate in significantly symbolize , standardized , and ordered religiously sanctified behavior . 
the code be mechanism for training in , and direct and enforce , uniform social interaction , and for continually and publicly reassert the solidarity of the group . 
person note long_ago that religion as `` a unified system of belief and practice relative to sacred thing - unite [ s ] into one single moral community - all those who adhere to them '' . 
his view be that every religion pertain to a community , and , conversely , every community be in one aspect a religious unit . 
this is bring_out in the common religious ethos that prevail even in the denominationally diverse audience at many secular semipublic and public occasion in the united_states ; and it is evidence in the prayer offer , in the frequent religious allusion , and in the confirmation of point on religious grounds . 
the unify effect of religion is also bring_out in the fact that historically people have cling together as more_or_less cohesive cultural unit , with religion as the dominant bond , even though spatially dispersed and not politically organized . 
the person for 2500 year have be a prime example , though the adherent of any world or inter people religion be case_in_point . 
it might be point_out that the integrating function of religion , for good or ill , has often support or been identify with other grouping - political , nationality , language , class , racial , sociability , even economic . 
religion usually exercise a stabilizing conserving function . 
as_such it act_as an anchor for the people . 
there be a marked tendency for religion , once firmly establish , to resist change , not_only in their own doctrine and policy and practice , but also in secular affairs have religious relevance . 
it has thus be a significant factor in the conservation of social values , though also in some measure , an obstacle to the creation or diffusion of new ones . 
it tend to support the longstanding precious sentiment , the traditional way of thinking , and the customary way of live . 
as person has point_out , the `` reliance on symbol , on tradition , on sacred_writing , on the cultivation of emotional feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values , turn one to the past far more than to the future '' . 
historically , religion has also function as a tremendous engine of vindication , enforcement , sanction , and perpetuation of various other institution . 
at_the_same_time that religion exercise a conserving influence , it also energize and motivate both individual and group . 
much of the important individual and social action has been owe to religious incentive . 
the great ultimate end of religion have serve as magnificent beacon_light that lure people toward them with an almost irresistible force , mobilize energy and induce sacrifice ; for_example , the crusade , mission effort , just war . 
much effort has been expend in the sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonition of religion . 
the insuperable reward system that most religion embody have great motivating effect . 
religion provide the most attractive reward , either in this world or the next , for those who not merely abide_by its norm , but who engage in good works . 
religion usually act_as a powerful aid in social_control , enforce what man should or should not do . 
among primitive people the sanction and dictate of religion be more binding than any of the other control exercise by the group ; and in modern society such influence be still great . 
religion have its own supernatural prescription that be at_the_same_time code_of_behavior for the here_and_now . 
an analysis of the election fall naturally in four part . 
first be the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion . 
preparation begin slightly more than a year after independence with the first_step to organize rural commune . 
all political interest support electoral planning , although there be some sign that the inherent uncertainty of a popular judgment lead to some procrastination . 
the second major aspect of the election be the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting . 
considerable technical skill was use and the administration of the election be generally above reproach . 
however , the regionally differentiated result , which appear below in table , be interesting evidence of the problem of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstance . 
a third aspect , and probably the one open_to most controversy , be the result of the election . 
the electoral procedure prevent the ready identification of party affiliation , but all vitally interested party , include the government itself , were busily engage in determine the party identification of all successful candidate the month following the election . 
the fourth and concluding point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the election and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics . 
election have figure prominently in nearly every government program and official address since independence . 
they were stress in the speech of person when the first group was form and again when the istiqlal take a leading role in the second group . 
person /5 , was know to be most sympathetic to the formation of local self-government and make the first firm promise of election on may_day , 1957 . 
there follow a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of election for the fall of 1957 , in which it appear that the person take the most pessimistic view and that the istiqlal be something less_than enthusiastic . 
since the complicated process of establish new commune and review the rudimentary plan leave by the_french did not even begin until the fall of 1957 , this goal appear somewhat ambitious . 
from the very beginning the electoral discussion raise fundamental issue in moroccan politics , precisely the type of question that be most difficult to resolve in the new government . 
until the charter_of_liberties was issue in the fall of 1958 , there be no guarantee of the right to assemble or to organize for political purpose . 
the istiqlal be still firmly united in 1957 , but the group ( group ) , the most important minor party at the time , object to the istiqlal 's predominance in the civil_service and influence in radio_maroc . 
there be rumor that the group favor an arbitrary , `` nonpolitical '' process , which were indirectly affirm when the king personally intervene in the planned meeting . 
the day following his intervention the palace issue a statement reassure the citizen that `` the possibility of introduce appeal concern the establishment of electoral list , list of candidate and finally the holding of the consultation itself '' would be support by the king himself . 
the ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postpone further consideration of election , but french consultant were call_in and notice of further investigation appear from_time_to_time . 
in january , 1958 , the person announce that an election law be ready to be submit to the king , the rumor of election date appear once_again , first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer . 
although the government be probably prepared for election by mid - 1958 , the first decision was no_doubt make more difficult as party strife multiply . 
in late 1957 the m.p. ( mouvement_populaire ) appear and in the spring of 1958 the internal strain of the istiqlal was reveal when the third group under person was form without support from progressive element in the party . 
the party be on_the_whole unprepared for election , while the people were still experience post independence letdown and suffer the aftereffect of poor harvest in 1957 . 
despite the internal and international crisis that harass morocco the election remain a central issue . 
they figure prominently in the person government of may , 1958 , which the king be reportedly determined to keep in office until election could be hold . 
but the eagerly seek `` homogeneity '' of the location group was never achieve as the istiqlal quarrel over foreign_policy , labor politics and economic development . 
by december , 1958 , when ' person become person , election have even greater importance . 
they were increasingly look_upon as a means of establish the new rural commune as the focus of a new , constructive national effort . 
to minimize the chance of repeat the person debacle the person government was form a titre personnel and a special office was create in the group to plan and to conduct the election . 
by this time there be little doubt but what election plan be complete . 
there remain only the delicate task of maneuver the law through the labyrinth of palace politics and make a small number of policy decision . 
from the rather tortuous history of electoral planning in morocco an important point emerge concern the first election in a developing country and evaluate their result . 
in the new country the electoral process is consider as a means of resolve fundamental , and sometimes bitter , difference among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance . 
in the absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organized political group hope that the election will give them new prominence , but in a system where there be as_yet no place for the less prominent . 
lack the respected and effective institution that consensus help provide , minority party , such_as the p.d.i. in 1957 and the progressive istiqlal faction in 1958 , clamor for election when out of power , but be not at_all certain they wish_to be control by popular choice when in power . 
those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process . 
the tendency to treat election as an instrument of self-interest rather_than an instrument of national interest have two important effect on electoral planning in morocco . 
at the central level the scrutin_uninominal_voting_system was select over some form of the scrutin_de_liste_system , even though the latter had been recommend by person and favor by all political_party . 
the choice of the single member district was dictate to a certain extent by problem of communication and understanding in the more remote area of the country , but it also serve to minimize the national political value of the election . 
although the election be for local official , it be not necessary to conduct the election so as to prevent party from publicly identify their candidate . 
with multiple member district the still fragmentary local party organization could have operate more effectively and party might have been encourage to state their position more clearly . 
both party and the group be busily at_work after the election try to unearth the political affiliation of the successful candidate and , thereby , give the election a confidential but known degree of national political significance . 
since a national interpretation cannot be avoid it be unfortunate that the election were not hold in a way to maximize party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation . 
the general setting of the moroccan election may also encourage the deterioration of local party organization . 
the concentration of effective power in rabat lead not_only to party bickering , but to distraction from local activity that might have have many auxiliary benefit in_addition to contribute to more meaningful election . 
interesting evidence can be find in the result of the chamber_of_commerce election , which take_place three week before national election . 
the istiqlal sponsor group ( group , group ) was oppose by candidate of the new group ( group ) in nearly all urban_center . 
as the more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy businessmen , the group was generally favor against the more progressive , labor based group the new party campaign heavily , while the old , more confident party expect the moroccan merchant and small_businessman to support them as they had do for many year . 
the local istiqlal and group office did not campaign and lose heavily . 
the value of the election was lost , both as an experiment in increased political participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest , as show in table /1 , . 
the group election be , of_course , an important event in the preparation for rural commune election . 
the group learn that its urban organization , which depend_on heavily on group support , be most effective . 
the istiqlal find that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle was not easily transpose to the more concrete , precise problem of internal politics . 
the overall effect be probably to stimulate more party activity in the communal election than might have otherwise take_place . 
a second major point of this essay be to examine the formal arrangement for the election . 
although a somewhat technical subject , it have important political implication as the above discussion of the voting_system indicate . 
furthermore , the problem and solution devise in the electoral experience of the rapidly changing country be often of comparative value and essential to evaluate election result . 
the sine_qua_non of the election be naturally an impartial and standardized procedure . 
as the background discussion indicate there be frequently expressed doubt that a government dominated_by either party could fairly administer election . 
the p.d.i. and later the popular_movement protect the istiqlal 's `` privileged position '' until the fall of person , and_then the istiqlal use the same argument , which it had previously ignore , against the pro group tendency of the person government . 
the bulk of the preparation had , of_course , proceed under the supervision of the group , whose official are bar from party activity and probably generally disinterested in party politics . 
apart from some area of recur trouble , like location , where inexperienced official had been appoint , there be little evidence that local official intervene in the electoral process . 
centrally , however , the administrative problem be more complex and the sheer prestige of office be very likely an unfair advantage . 
the king decide to remove person a week before election and to institute a nonparty group under his personal direction . 
although the monarch had frequently assert that the election were to be without party significance , his action be an implicit admission that party identification be a factor . 
the new council be itself inescapably of political meaning , which was most clearly reveal in the absence of any group member and the presence of several istiqlal leaders . 
since the detail of the election were settle the change of government have no direct effect on the technical aspect of the election , and may have been more important as an indication of royal displeasure with the u.n.f.p. 
voting preparation begin in the fall of 1959 , although the actual demarcation and planning for the rural commune was complete in 1958 . 
there be three major administrative task : the fixing of electoral district , the registration of voter and the registration of candidate . 
voter registration begin in late november 1959 and continue until early january , 1960 . 
the government be most anxious that there be a respectable response . 
periodic bulletin of the accomplishment in each province make the registration process into a kind of competition among provincial official . 
a goal was fix , as give in table 2 , and attention focus_on its fulfillment . 
the qualification to vote were keep very simple . 
both man and woman of twenty-one years of_age could register and vote upon present proof of residence and identification . 
there be liberal provision for dispensation where document or record be lacking . 
the police be disqualified along with certain category of naturalized citizen , criminal and those punish for protectorate activity . 
the registration figure give in table 2 must be interpret with caution since the estimate for eligible elector were make without the benefit of a reliable census . 
but neither be the statement empirical , for goodness be not a quality like red or squeaky that could be see or hear . 
what were they to do , then , with these awkward judgment of value ? 
to find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the theory radically , and yet that theory be what they regard_as their most important discovery . 
it appear that the theory could be save in one way only . 
if it could be show that judgment of good and bad be not judgment at_all , that they assert nothing true or false , but merely express emotion like `` hurrah '' or `` fiddlesticks '' , then these wayward judgment would cease from trouble and weary head could be at_rest . 
this be the course the positivist take . 
they explain value judgment by explain them away . 
now i do not think their view will do . 
but before discuss it , i should_like to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they have state their case . 
it has been say of person that he write so clearly that he could be find_out . 
this theory has been put so clearly and precisely that it deserve criticism of the same kind , and this i will do my best to supply . 
the theory claim to show by analysis that when we say , `` that be good '' , we do not mean to assert a character of the subject of which we are think . 
i shall argue that we do mean to do just that . 
let us work_through an example , and the simple and common the better . 
there is perhaps no value_statement on which people would more universally agree than the statement that intense pain be bad . 
let us take a set of circumstance in which i happen to be interested on the legislative side and in which i think every one of us might naturally make such a statement . 
we come_upon a rabbit that has been catch in one of the brutal trap in common use . 
there be sign that it has struggle for day to escape and that in a frenzy of hunger , pain , and fear , it has all_but eat off its own leg . 
the attempt fail : the animal be now dead . 
as we think_of the long and excruciating pain it must have suffer , we be very likely to say : `` it be a bad thing that the little animal should suffer so '' . 
the positivist tell us that when we say this we are only express our present emotion . 
i hold , on_the_contrary , that we mean to assert something of the pain itself , namely , that it be bad - bad when and as it occur . 
consider what follow from the positivist view . 
on that view , nothing good or bad happen in the case until i come_on the scene and make my remark . 
for what i express in my remark be something go_on in me at the time , and that of_course did not exist until i did come_on the scene . 
the pain of the rabbit be not itself bad ; nothing evil was happen when that pain was being endure ; badness , in the only sense in which it is involve at_all , wait for its appearance till i come and look and feel . 
now that this be at_odds with our meaning may be show as_follows . 
let us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come_on the scene and that the rabbit never was discover . 
be we prepared to say that in that case nothing bad occur in the sense in which we say it did ? 
clearly not . 
indeed we should say , on_the_contrary , that the accident of our later discovery make no difference whatever to the badness of the animal 's pain , that it would have be every whit as bad whether a chance passerby happen later to discover the body and feel repugnance or not . 
if so , then it be clear that in say the suffering be bad we are not express our feeling only . 
we are say that the pain be bad when and as it occur and before anyone take an attitude toward it . 
the first argument be thus an ideal experiment in which we use the method of difference . 
it remove our present expression and show that the badness we mean would not be affect by this , whereas on positivist ground it should be . 
the second argument apply the method in the reverse way . 
it ideally remove the past event , and show that this would render false what we mean to say , whereas on positivist ground it should not . 
let us suppose that the animal did not in_fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at_all , but that we mistakenly believe it did , and say as before that its suffering be an evil thing . 
on the positivist theory , everything i seek to express by call it evil in the first case be still present in the second . 
in the only sense in which badness is involve at_all , whatever be bad in the first case be still present in its entirety , since all that is express in either case be a state of feeling , and that feeling be still there . 
and our question be , be such an implication consistent with what we mean ? 
clearly it be not . 
if anyone ask us , after we make the remark that the suffering be a bad thing , whether we should think it relevant to what we say to learn that the incident had never occur and no pain had been suffer at_all , we should say that it make all the difference in_the_world , that what we were assert to be bad be precisely the suffering we think had occur back there , that if this had not occur , there be nothing leave to be bad , and that our assertion be in that case mistaken . 
the suggestion that in say something evil had occur we were after_all make no mistake , because we had never mean anyhow to say anything about the past suffering , seem to me merely frivolous . 
if we did not mean to say this , why should we be so relieve on find that the suffering had not occur ? 
on the theory before us , such relief would be groundless , for in that suffering itself there be nothing bad at_all , and hence in its nonoccurrence there would be nothing to be relieve about . 
the positivist theory would here distort our meaning beyond recognition . 
so_far_as i can see , there is only one way_out for the positivist . 
he hold that goodness and badness lie_in feeling of approval or disapproval . 
and there is a way in which he might hold that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval without belong_to the pain itself . 
the pain in itself be neutral ; but unfortunately the rabbit , on no ground at_all , take_up toward this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that make it for_the_first_time , and in the only intelligible sense , bad . 
this way of escape be theoretically possible , but since it have grave difficulty of its own and has not , so_far_as i know , be urge by positivist , it be perhaps best not to spend time over it . 
i come now to a third argument , which again be very simple . 
when we come_upon the rabbit and make our remark about its suffering be a bad thing , we presumably make it with some feeling ; the positivist be plainly right in say that such remark do usually express feeling . 
but suppose that a week later we revert to the incident in thought and make our statement again . 
and suppose that the circumstance have now so change that the feeling with which we make the remark in_the_first_place has fade . 
the pathetic evidence be no_longer before us ; and we be now so fatigued in body and mind that feeling be , as_we_say , quite dead . 
in these circumstance , since what was express by the remark when first make be , on the theory before us , simply absent , the remark now express nothing . 
it be as empty as the word `` hurrah '' would be when there be no enthusiasm behind it . 
and this seem to me untrue . 
when we repeat the remark that such suffering be a bad thing , the feeling with which we make it last week may be at or near the vanishing_point , but if we were ask whether we mean to say what we did before , we should certainly answer yes . 
we should say that we make our point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time , but that it be the same point we were make . 
and if we can see that what we mean to say remain the same , while the feeling vary from intensity to near zero , it be not the feeling that we primarily mean to express . 
i come now to a fourth consideration . 
we all believe that toward act or effect of a certain kind one attitude be fitting and another not ; but on the theory before us such a belief would not make_sense . 
person and person have lately contend that this fitness be one of the main fact of ethics , and i suspect they be right . 
but that be not exactly my point . 
my point be this : 
whether there is such fitness or not , we all assume that there is , and if we do , we express in moral judgment more than the subjectivist say we do . 
let me illustrate . 
in his novel the_house_of_the_dead , person tell of his experience in a location prison_camp . 
whatever the unhappy inmate of such camp be like today , person 's companion be about as grim a lot as can be imagine . 
`` i have hear story '' , he write , `` of the most terrible , the most unnatural action , of the most monstrous murder , tell with the most spontaneous , childishly merry laughter '' . 
most of us would say that in this delight at the killing of others or the cause of suffering there is something very unfitting . 
if we were ask why we think so , we should say that these thing involve great evil and be wrong , and that to take delight in what be evil or wrong be plainly unfitting . 
now on the subjectivist view , this answer is rule_out . 
for before someone take_up an attitude toward death , suffering , or their infliction , they have no moral quality at_all . 
there is therefore nothing about them to which an attitude of approval or condemnation could be fitting . 
they be in themselves neutral , and , so_far_as they get a moral quality , they get it only through being invest with it by the attitude of the onlooker . 
but if that is true , why be any attitude more fitting than any other ? 
would applause , for_example , be fitting if , apart from the applause , there be nothing good to applaud ? 
would condemnation be fitting if , independently of the condemnation , there be nothing bad to condemn ? 
in such a case , any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting as any other , which mean that the notion of fitness has lose all point . 
indeed we are force to go much farther . 
if goodness and badness lie_in attitude only and hence are bring into being by them , those man who greet death and misery with childishly merry laughter are take the only sensible line . 
if there is nothing evil in these thing , if they get their moral complexion only from our feeling about them , why should n't they be greet with a cheer ? 
to greet them with repulsion would turn_into what before be neutral into something bad ; it would needlessly bring badness into the world ; and even on subjectivist assumption that does not seem very bright . 
on_the_other_hand , to greet them with delight would convert what before be neutral into something good ; it would bring goodness into the world . 
the injured german veteran be a former miner , twenty-four year old , who had been wound by shrapnel in the back of the head . 
this result in damage to the occipital_lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also . 
in_any_event , the extraordinary result of this injury be that he become `` psychically blind '' , while at_the_same_time , apparently , the sense_of_touch remain essentially intact . 
psychical blindness be a condition in which there be a total absence of visual memory_image , a condition in which , for_example , one be unable to remember something just see or to conjure_up a memory_picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence . 
this circumstance in the patient 's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remain basically in sound working order constitute its exceptional value for the problem at_hand since the evidence present by the author be overwhelming that , when the patient close his eye , he have absolutely no spatial ( that_is , third-dimensional ) awareness whatsoever . 
the necessary inference , as the author themselves interpret it , would seem to be this : `` ( 1 ) spatial quality be not among those grasp by the sense_of_touch , as_such . 
we do not arrive_at spatial image by means of the sense_of_touch by itself . 
( 2 ) spatiality become part of the tactual_sensation only by way of visual representation ; that_is , there be , in the true sense , only a visual_space '' . 
the underlying assumption , of_course , be that only sight and touch enable us , in any precise and fully dependable way , to locate object in space beyond us , the other sense be decidedly inferior , if_not totally inadequate , in this regard . 
this be an assumption with which few would be dispose to quarrel . 
therefore , if the sense_of_touch is function normally and there be a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically blind person when the eye are close and an object is handle , the conclusion seem unavoidable that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality of thing and that actual sight or visual representation be necessary . 
the force of the author ' analysis ( if indeed it have any force ) can be feel by the reader , i believe , only after three question have been successfully answer . 
( 1 ) what allow us to think that the patient have no third-dimensional representation when his eye were close ? 
( 2 ) what evidence is there that he be psychically blind ? 
( 3 ) how can we be sure that his sense_of_touch was not profoundly disturb by his head injury ? 
we shall consider these in the inverse order of their presentation . 
obviously , a satisfactory answer to the third question be imperative , if the argument is to get underway at_all , for if there be any possibility of doubt whether the patient 's tactual sensitivity had been impair by the occipital lesion , any finding whatsoever in regard_to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail altogether , of_course , as evidence to establish the desired conclusion . 
the answer the author give to it , therefore , be of supreme importance . 
it be as_follows : `` the usual sensitivity test show that the specific quality of skin_perceptiveness ( pressure , pain , temperature ) , as_well_as the kinesthetic sensation ( muscular feeling , feeling in the tendon and joint ) , be , as_such , essentially intact , although they seem , in_comparison_with normal reaction , to be somewhat diminished over the entire body . 
the supposed tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient and his ability to specify the location of a member , as_well_as the direction and scope of a movement , passively execute ( with one of his member ) , prove to have been , on_the_contrary , very considerably affect '' . 
the author insist , however , that these abnormality in the sense_of_touch be due_to absolutely to no organic disorder in that sense faculty but rather to the injury which the patient had sustain to the sense of sight . 
first_of_all , what be their evidence that the tactual apparatus be fundamentally undamaged ? 
( 1 ) when an object was place in the patient 's hand , he have no difficulty determine whether it be warm or cold , sharp or blunt , rough or smooth , flexible , soft , or hard ; and he could tell , simply by the feel of it , whether it be made of wood , iron , cloth , rubber , and_so_on . 
and he could recognize , by touch alone , article which he had handle immediately before , even though they be altogether unfamiliar to him and could not be identify by him ; that_is , he be unaware what kind of object they be or what their use be . 
( 2 ) the patient attain an astonishing efficiency in a new trade . 
because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffer to his sight , the patient had to train himself for a new line_of_work , that of a portfolio maker , an occupation require a great_deal of precision in the make of measurement and a fairly well developed sense of form and contour . 
it seem clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient ( we shall describe it in_detail in_connection_with our second question , the one concern the psychical blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely_on his sense_of_touch much more_than the usual portfolio maker and that consequently that faculty be most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision . 
and so the author conclude : `` the conduct of the patient in his everyday life and in his work , even more_than the foregoing fact [ mention above under 1 ] , leave positively no room for doubt that the sense_of_touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , be unaffected ; or , to put the same thing in physiological term , that the performance capacity of the tactual apparatus , from the periphery up to the tactual center in the brain , - that_is , from one end to the other - be unimpaired '' . 
if the argument is accept as essentially sound up to this point , it remain for us to consider whether the patient 's difficulty in orient himself spatially and in locate object in space with the sense_of_touch can be explain by his defective visual condition . 
but before we can do this , we must first find answer to our original question 1 and 2 ; then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at_hand . 
in what way , then , did the patient 's psychical blindness manifest itself ? 
he could not see object as unified , self-contained , and organized figure , as a person does with normal vision . 
the meaning of_this , as we shall see , be that he have no fund of visual memory_image of object as object ; and , therefore , he could not recognize even long-familiar thing upon see them again . 
instead , he constantly become lost in part and component of them , confuse some of their detail with those of neighboring object , and_so_on , unless he allow time to `` trace '' the object in_question through minute movement of the head and hand and in this way to discover its contour . 
according_to his own testimony , he never actually see thing as shaped but only as generally amorphous `` blot '' of color of a more_or_less indefinite size ; at their edge they slip pretty_much out_of_focus altogether . 
but by the tracing procedure , he could , in a strange obviously kinesthetic manner , find the unseen form ; could piece , as_it_were , the jumbled mass together into an organized whole and_then recognize it as a man or a triangle or whatever it turn_out to be . 
if , however , the figure to be discern be complicated , compose of several interlocking subfigure , and_so_on , even the tracing process fail him , and he could not focus even relatively simple shape among its part . 
this mean , concretely , that the patient could not read at_all without make writing like movement of the head or body , become easily confuse by `` hash_mark '' insert between handwritten word and thus confuse the mark for one of the letter , and could recognize a simple straight_line or a curved one only by trace it . 
the patient himself deny that he have any visual imagery at_all ; and there be ample evidence of the following sort to corroborate him . 
after a conversation with another man , he be able to recount practically everything that had been say but could not describe at_all what the other man look_like . 
nor could he call_up memory_picture of close friend or relative . 
in_short , both his own declaration and his figural_blindness , when he look at object , seem to present undeniable evidence that he have simply no visual memory at_all . 
he be oblivious of the form of the object actually being view , precisely because he could not assign it to a visual shape , already learn and hold in visual memory , as person of normal vision do . 
he could not recognize it ; he be absolutely unfamiliar with it because he have no visual memory at_all . 
therefore , his only recourse be to learn the shape all_over again for each new visual experience of the same individual object or type of object ; and this he could do only by go_over its mass with the tracing procedure . 
then he might finally recognize it , apparently by combine the visual blot , actually being see , with tactual feeling in_the_head or body accompany the tracing movement . 
this would mean , it can readily be see , that , again , for each new visual experience the tracing motion would have_to be repeat because of the absence of visual imagery . 
as one would surmise , the procedure , however , could be repeat with the same object or with the same type of object often enough , so that the corresponding visual blot and the mere beginning of the tracing movement would provide clue as_to the actual shape , which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of inference . 
man , tree , automobile , house , and_so_on - object continually confront in everyday life - have each its characteristic blot appearance and become easily recognizable , at the very beginning of tracing , by an inference as_to what each be . 
dice , for_example , he infer from black dot on a white surface . 
he evidently could not actually see the corner of these object , but their size and the dot give_away them away . 
and the author give numerous instance of calculated guessing on the patient 's part to show how large a role it play in his process of readapt himself and how proficient he become at it . 
often he seem even to have be able to guess correctly , without the tracing motion , solely on the basis of qualitative difference among the blot like thing which appear in his visual experience . 
perhaps the very important question - what be , then , exactly the role of kinesthetic sensation in the patient 's ability to recognize form and shape by means of the tracing movement when he is actually look at thing ? 
- has now been raise in the reader 's mind and in the following form . 
if the patient can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually , then , it would seem , the sense_of_touch have immediate contact with the spatial aspect of thing in_independence_of visual representation , at_least in regard_to two dimension , and , as we shall see , even this much spatial awareness on_the_part_of unaided touch is deny by the author . 
how , then , do the kinesthetic sensation function in all this ? 
the author set_about answer this fundamental question through a detailed investigation of the patient 's ability , tactually , ( 1 ) to perceive figure and ( 2 ) to locate object in space , with his eye close ( or turn_away from the object concerned ) . 
quite naturally , they make the investigation , first , by prohibit the patient from make any movement at_all and_then , later , by repeat it and allow the patient to move in any way he want to . 
when the patient was not allow to move his body in any way at_all , the following striking result occur . 
whenever artist , indeed , turn_to actual representation or mold three-dimensional_figure , which be rare down to 800 bc , they tend to reflect reality ( see plate 6a , 9b ) ; a schematic , abstract treatment of man and animal , by intent , rise only in the late eighth century . 
to speak of this underlying view of the world be to embark upon matter of subjective judgment . 
at_the_least , however , one may conclude that geometric potter sense a logical order ; their principle of composition stand very close to those which appear in the homeric epic and the hexameter line . 
their world , again , be a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly begin to appreciate the complexity of life . 
and perhaps an observer of the vase will not go_too_far in deduce that the outlook of their maker and user be basically stable and secure . 
the storm of the past had die_away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not_yet begin to disturb man 's mind . 
throughout the work of the late ninth century a calm , severe serenity display itself . 
in the vase this spirit may perhaps at_times bore or repel one in its internal self-satisfaction , but the best of the geometric pin have rightly been consider among the most beautiful ever make in the greek world . 
the ninth century be in its artistic work `` the spiritually free and most self-sufficient between past and future '' , and the loving skill spend by its artist upon their product be a testimonial to their sense that what they were do be important and be appreciated . 
geometric pottery has not_yet receive the thorough , detailed study which it deserve , partly because the task be a mammoth one and partly because some of its local manifestation , as at location , are only now come_to_light . 
from even a cursory inspection of its many aspect , however , the historian can deduce several fundamental conclusion about the progress of the aegean world down to 800 bc 
the general intellectual outlook which had appear in the eleventh century was now consolidate to a significant degree . 
much which be in_embryo in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800 . 
in this process the minoan mycenaean inheritance had been transmute or finally reject ; the aegean world which had exist before 1000 differ from that which rise more clearly in our vision after 800 . 
those modern scholar who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of aegean development from early times - granted occasional irruption of people and idea from outside - be correct ; but all_too many observer have been mislead by this fact into minimize the degree of change which take_place in the early first millennium . 
the focus of novelty in this world now lie_in the southeastern district of the greek mainland , and by 800 virtually the entire aegean , always except its northern shore , had accept the geometric style of pottery . 
while protogeometric vase usually turn_up , especially outside greece proper , together with as_many or more example of local stamp , these `` non greek '' pattern had mostly vanish by the late ninth century . 
in their place come local variation within the common style - tentative , as_it_were , in protogeometric product but truly distinct and sharply defined as the geometric spirit develop . 
attica , though important , be not the only teacher of this age . 
one can take a vase of about 800 bc and , without any knowledge of its place_of_origin , venture to assign it to a specific area ; imitation and borrowing of motif now become ascertainable . 
the potter of the aegean_island thus stand apart from those of the mainland , and in greece itself argive , corinthian , attic , boeotian , and other geometric sequence have each their own hallmark . 
these local variation were to become ever sharp in the next century and a half . 
the same conclusion can be draw from the other physical evidence of the dark_ages , from linguistic distribution , and from the survival of early social , political , and religious pattern into late age . 
by 800 bc the aegean be an area of common tongue and of common culture . 
on these pillar rest that solid basis for life and thought which was soon to be manifest in the remarkably unlimited ken of the iliad . 
everywhere within the common pattern , however , one find local diversity ; greek history and culture were enduringly fertilize , and plague , by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factor . 
further we cannot go , for the dark_ages deserve their name . 
many aspect of civilization were not_yet sufficiently crystallize to find expression , nor could the simple economic and social foundation of this world support a lofty structure . 
the epic_poem , the consolidation of the greek pantheon , the rise of firm political_unit , the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representation of man - all these had to await the progress of following decade . 
what we have see in this chapter , we have see only dimly , and yet the result , however general , be worth the search . 
these be the century in which the inhabitant of the aegean world settle firmly into their mind and into their institution the foundation of the hellenic outlook , independent of outside force . 
to interpret , indeed , the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect bear of our lack of detailed information ; if we could see more deeply , we probably would find many side issue and wrong turning which come to an end within the period . 
the historian can only point_out those line which be major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence , and must hope that future excavation will enrich our understanding . 
throughout the dark_ages , it be clear , the greek world had been develop slowly but consistently . 
the pace could now be accelerate , for the inhabitant of the aegean stood_on_firm_ground . 
the landscape of greek history broaden widely , and rather abruptly , in the eighth century bc , the age of homer 's `` rosy fingered dawn '' . 
the first slanting ray of the new day cannot yet dispel all the dark shadow which lie across the aegean world ; but our evidence grow considerably in variety and show more unmistakably some of the line of change . 
for this period , as for early century , pottery remain the most secure source ; the ceramic material of the age be more abundant , more diversified , and more indicative_of the hope and fear of its maker , who begin to show scene of human life and death . 
figurine and simple chapel presage the emergence of sculpture and architecture in greece ; object in gold , ivory , and bronze grow more numerous . 
since writing was practice in the aegean before the end of the century , we may hope that the detail of tradition will now be occasionally useful . 
though it be not easy to apply the evidence of the iliad to any specific era , this marvelous product of the epic tradition had certainly take_shape definitive shape by 750 . 
the dipylon_geometric pottery of athens and the iliad be amazing manifestation of the inherent potentiality of greek civilization ; but both be among the last product of a phase which was end . 
greek civilization was swirl toward its great revolution , in which the developed quality of the hellenic outlook were suddenly to break forth . 
the revolution be well underway before 700 bc , and premonitory sign go_back virtually across the century . 
the era , however , be janus-faced . 
while many token point forward , the main achievement stand as a culmination of the simple pattern of the dark_ages . 
the dominant pottery of the century be geometric ; political organization revolve_about the basileus ; trade was just begin to expand ; the god who protect the greek countryside were only now put_on their sharply anthropomorphic dress . 
the modern student , who know what was to come next , be likely to place first the factor of change which be visible in the eighth century . 
not all man of the period would have accept this emphasis . 
many potter cling_to the past the more determinedly as they were confront with radically new idea ; the poet of the iliad deliberately archaize . 
although it be not possible to sunder old and new in this era , i shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decade of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an apogee of the first stage of greek civilization . 
on this principle of division i must postpone the evolution of sculpture , architecture , society , and politics ; for the development in these area make_sense only if they be connected to the age of revolution itself . 
the growing contact between aegean and orient be also a phase which should be link primarily to the remarkable broadening of hellenic culture after 750 . 
we shall not be able entirely to pass_over these connection to the east as we consider ripe_geometric pottery , the epic and the myth , and the religious evolution of early greece ; the important point , however , be that these magnificent achievement , unlike those of later decade , were only incidentally influence by oriental model . 
the antecedent of dipylon vase and of the iliad lie_in the aegean past . 
the pottery of the first_half of the eighth century is commonly called ripe_geometric . 
the severe yet harmonious vase of the previous fifty year , the strong geometric style of the late ninth century , display as firm a mastery of the principle underlying geometric pottery ; but artist now be ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance . 
the vase which result have different shape , far more complex decoration , and a larger sense of style . 
beyond the aesthetic and technical aspect of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broad line . 
in earlier century man had have enough to do in rebuild a fundamental sense of order after chaos . 
they had had_to work_on very simple foundation and had not dared to give rein to impulse . 
the potter , in_particular , had virtually eschew freehand drawing , elaborate motif , and the curving line of nature , while yet express a belief that there be order in the universe . 
in their vase were embody the basic aesthetic and logical characteristic of greek civilization , at_first hesitantly in protogeometric work , and_then more confidently in the initial stage of the geometric style . 
by 800 social and cultural security had been achieve , at_least on a simple plane ; it be time to take big step , to venture on experiment . 
ripe_geometric potter continue to employ the old syntax of ornament and shape and make use of the well-defined though limited range of motif which they had inherit . 
in these respect the vase of the early eighth century represent a culmination of earlier line of progress . 
to the ancestral lore , however , new material were add . 
painter leave less and less of a vase in a plain dark color ; instead they divide the surface into many band or cover it by all-over pattern into which freehand drawing begin to creep . 
wavy line , feather like pattern , rosette of indefinitely floral nature , bird either singly or in stylized row , animal in solemn frieze band ( see plate 11 - 12 ) - all these turn_up in the more developed fabric as preliminary sign that the potter were broaden their gaze . 
the row of animal and bird , in_particular , suggest awareness of oriental animal frieze , transmit perhaps via syrian silver bowl and textile , but the specific form of these row on local vase and metal product be nonetheless greek . 
though the spread of this type of decoration in the aegean has not_yet been precisely determine , it seem to appear first in the cyclades , which be among the leading exporter of pottery throughout the century . 
as the material at the command of the potter grow and the volume of their production increase , the local variation within a common style become more evident . 
plate 12 illustrate four example , which be ripe or late_geometric work of common spirit but of different school . 
person had discover a beef in his possession a_few day earlier and , when he could not show the hide , arrest him . 
think the evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later release him . 
even while suffer the trip to his home , person swear to person and person that he would kill the indian . 
three week later following his recovery , armed with a writ issue by the location justice on affidavit prepare by the district_attorney , person and person ride to arrest person . 
arrive at daybreak , they find person in his corral and demand that he surrender . 
instead , he whirl and run to his house for a gun force them to kill him , person report . 
both person 's and person 's life were threaten by the mexican following the killing , but the company officer feel that in_the_end , it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion . 
general_manager person even suggest that it might be wise to keep the mexican in suspense rather_than accept their offer to sell_out and move away , and try to have a_few punish . 
on february 17 , person and person were send to the location community on the location to see about rent_out ranch the company had purchase . 
while talk with person , person and person appear , both heavily armed , and after watch the house for_a_while , ride_away . 
it be nearly sundown before they finish the business with person and begin ride down the stream . 
they had travel only a short distance when they spot five mexican ride along a horse-trail across the stream just ahead of them . 
suspect an ambush , the two deputy decide to ride up a side canyon take a shortcut into location . 
after spend two night ( wednesday and thursday ) in location , the deputy again head for the location to finish their business . 
they stay with a rancher friday night and by eleven o'clock saturday morning pass the old person ranch . 
half a mile below at the mouth of location be an old ranch that the company had purchase from person , occupy by a mexican , his wife , and an old trapper . 
there be three house in location just at the foot of a low bluff , the road wind along the top , enter above , and_then pass down in_front_of the house , thence to the location . 
to the west of this road be another low bluff , forty or fifty foot high , covered with scrub_oak and other brush . 
as they were ride along this wind road on the bench of land between the two bluff , a volley of rifle fire suddenly crash around the two officer . 
not a bullet touch person who be nearer the ambush , but one hit person in the leg and another break his arm , pass_on through his body . 
with the first report , person 's horse wheel to the right and run towards the building while person , follow by a hail of bullet , race towards the arroyo of location immediately in_front_of him , just reach it as his horse fall . 
grab his winchester from its sheath , person prepare to fight from behind the arroyo bank . 
bullet be so thick , throw sand in his face , that he find it difficult to return the fire . 
notice person 's horse in_front_of the long log building , he assume his friend had slip inside and would be able to put_up a good fight , so he begin work his way down the ditch to join him . 
at a very shallow place , two mexican rush into the open for a shot . 
drop to one knee , cook fell one , and the other struggle off with his comrade , send no further fire in his direction . 
just before leave the arroyo where he was partially concealed , he did hear shot down at the house . 
person had reach the house as person surmise , dismount , but just as the old trapper open the door to receive him , he fall into the trapper 's arm - dead . 
a bullet fire by one of the mexican hide in a little chicken house had pass_through his head , tear a hole two inch square on the outgoing side . 
find him dead , person catch person 's horse and ride to the cattle foreman 's house to report the incident and request bloodhound to trail the assassin . 
before daylight sunday morning , a posse of twenty-three man under the leadership of person of location follow the trail to the house of person , where 100 to 150 mexican had gather . 
person boldly approach the fortified adobe_house and demand entrance . 
the men inside inform him that they have some wounded men among them but he would not be allow to see them even_though he offer medical_aid . 
the officer demand the name of the injured man ; the mexican not_only refuse to give them , but tell the posseman if they want a fight they could have it . 
since the strength of the mexican had been underrate , too small a posse had been collect , and since the deputy had not been provide with search_warrant , person and his man decide it be much wise to withdraw . 
the posse 's retreat encourage the mexican to be overbearing and impudent . 
during the following week , six ton of hay belong to one rancher were burn ; some building , farm tool , two horse , plow , and hay own by person , a friendly interpreter for the company , and person ' hay were steal or destroy ; and a store was break into and rob . 
district_attorney person warn that he would vigorously prosecute person catch commit these crime or carry arms - he just did n't catch anyone . 
increasing threat on his life finally convince person that he should leave new_mexico . 
his friend advise that it would be only a question of time until either the mexican kill him by ambuscade or he would be compel to kill them in self-defense , perpetuate the trouble . 
by early summer , he write from location that he was suffer from the wound inflict in the ambush and be in_a_bad_way financially , so person send him a draft for $ 100 , warn that it be still not wise for him to return . 
person also send a check for $ 100 to person 's widow and have a white marble monument erect on his grave . 
cattle steal and killing , again serious during the spring of 1891 , place the land_grant company officer in a perplexing position . 
they be reluctant to appoint sheriff to protect the property , thus run_a_risk of create disturbance such_as that on the location , and yet the cowboy protest that they get no salary for arrest cattle_thief and run_a_risk of being shoot . 
and the law virtually ignore the situation . 
the judge become ill just as the group convene , no substitute was bring_in , no criminal case hear , only 5 out of 122 case docket were try , and court adjourn sine_die after sit a_few day instead_of the usual three week . 
person complain : 
`` litigant and witness were put to the expense and inconvenience of go long distance to transact business ; public money spend ; justice delay ; nothing accomplish , and the whole distribution of justice in this county seem to be an absolute farce '' . 
word reach the company that the man behind these depredation be person , a man with many follower , include a number who were keep in line through fear of him . 
although want by the sheriff for kill an old_man name person , the warrant for his arrest had never been serve . 
on may 19 , a deputy_sheriff 's posse of eight man leave location and ride thirty-five mile up the location where they were join by person . 
by 3 : 00 a.m. they reach his house and find it vacant . 
when they were refuse entrance to his brother 's house nearby , they smash down the door , break the window , and throw lighted clothes wet with kerosene into the room . 
still there be no person and the family would say nothing . 
about 300 yard up the creek be a cluster of mexican house contain six room in the form of a square . 
while prowl around these building , two of the posse recognize the voice of person speak_to the people inside . 
he was promise that no harm would befall him if he would come_out , but he curse and reply that he would shoot any man come_near the door . 
the posse then ask that he send_out the woman and child as the building would be fire or tear_down over his head if necessary to take him dead or alive . 
again he refuse . 
in deadly earnest , the besieger methodically strip away portion of the roof and toss lighted rag inside , only to have most stamp_out by the woman as_soon_as they hit the floor . 
when it become obvious that he could stay inside no_longer , take a_thousand to one chance person rush outside , square against the muzzle of a winchester . 
shoot near the heart , he turn to one side and plunge for a door to another room several foot away , three bullet follow him . 
as he push open the door he fall on his face , one of his comrade pull him inside . 
not realize the seriousness of the wound , the besieger warn that if he did not surrender the house would be burn_down around him . 
receive no answer , they set_on_fire the fire . 
when the house be about half consume , his comrade run to the door and throw up his hand , declare repeatedly that he did not know the whereabouts of person . 
find it true that he be not inside , the deputy return to the first house and tear hole through the side and the roof until they could see a body on the bed covered by a blanket . 
several slug fire into the bed jerk aside the blanket to reveal an apparently lifeless hand . 
shoot six or eight time the body be draped with person 's pistol , belt , and cartridge . 
there be no extra horse so it was leave to his comrade who , though number in the fifty , had stand around on the hillside nearby without fire a shot during the entire attack . 
early the next morning , a mexican telephone person that person , one of the posse member , be surround by ten mexican at his father 's home on the upper location . 
the sheriff and person hastily swear_out a number of warrant against man who had been ride about armed , according_to signed statement by person and person , and order person of location to rescue the posseman . 
travel all night , person and twelve man arrive at about seven o'clock may 22 . 
occasionally they hear gunshot signal and a number of horseman were sight on the hills , disappear at the posse 's approach . 
a mexican justice_of_the_peace had issue a writ against person for take_part in the `` murder '' of person so he and his father be anxious to be take_out of danger . 
the man help them gather their belongings and escort them to location along with three other family desire to leave . 
the ten or more dangerous party single_out for prosecution be still at_large , and person realize that if these man entrench themselves in their adobe_house , defend themselves through loophole , it would be most difficult to capture them . 
thus he wire group of denver : `` have you any percussion hand_grenade for throw in a house or across a well load with ball or shrapnel shot ? 
if_not , how long to order and what be the price '' ? 
he wisely decide that it would be foolish to create a disturbance during the coming roundup , particularly since the mexican be on_guard their guard . 
his problem then become one of restrain the american fighter who wanted to clean_out the person by force immediately . 
the plant be located west of the location and south of the location of the former electric_light plant . 
the group issue 214 share of stock at $ 10 each for construction of a sewer in that locality , and assessment were make for its maintenance . 
it has give considerable trouble at_times and empty right into the battenkill . 
location discuss its possible purchase in 1945 , but consider it an unwise investment . 
the sewer on location was construct when there be only a_few house on the street . 
as new home were build they were connect so that all residence south of location are serve by it . 
person be the present treasurer and manager . 
the 1946 town_meeting vote to have the selectman appoint a committee to investigate and report on the feasibility of some system of sewage_disposal and a disposal_plant to serve location , location , and location . 
the committee submit a report sign by person and person with a map publish in the 1946 town report . 
the layout of the sewer_line was design by person , who be the engineer for the location disposal_plant . 
no figure were submit with the report and no action was take on it by the town . 
the 1958 town_meeting direct town authority to seek federal and state funds with which to conduct a preliminary survey of a proposed sewage plant with its attendant facility . 
the final step be a vote for a $ 230000 bond issue for the construction of a sewage_system by the 1959 town_meeting , later confirm by a two-thirds vote at a special town_meeting june_21 , 1960 . 
there the matter stand with the prospect that soon manchester may be remove from the roster of town contribute raw sewage to its main stream . 
manchester 's unusual interest in telegraphy has often been attribute to the fact that the person , headmaster of group and group , be a personal friend and correspondent of the inventor , person . 
at_any_rate , manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system which was set_up in 1844 between baltimore and washington . 
in 1846 person , jeweler and watchmaker , become the town 's first telegrapher in a dwelling he build for himself and his business `` two door north of the location '' or `` one door north of the group , manchester , vermont '' . 
person be telegrapher for the `` group '' and the `` group '' . 
share of capital_stock at $ 15 each in the latter company be payable at the group or at various other vermont bank . 
a message of less_than fifteen word to bennington cost twenty-five cent . 
by 1871 person , manager of the `` group '' , express willingness to send emergency telegram on sunday from his village drugstore . 
person even needed to hire an assistant , person . 
the group comment editorially on the surprising amount of local telegraphic business . 
in the fall of 1878 , the `` group '' was establish between manchester and location by the owner , person , person , person , and person . 
the line soon live_up_to its name , as local message of moderate length could be send for a dime and the company be quickly able to declare very liberal dividend on its capital_stock . 
in 1879 the same person , with person of location , form the `` group '' , extend from location via location and location to location . 
besides be most convenient , the line `` soon prove a good investment for the owner '' . 
telegrapher at the location at this time be person and person of `` group '' , dealer in lumber and drygoods . 
early equipment be very flimsy ; the smallest gust of wind topple pole , make communication impossible . 
but company continue to spring_up . 
by 1883 the `` group '' be in existence and person be its president . 
operate in 1887 was the `` group '' , officer of which be person , president ; person , vice_president and secretary ; person , treasurer ; person , superintendent ; person , assistant superintendent . 
two company now have headquarters with person , who by then have his own drugstore at location - the `` group '' and the `` group '' . 
operator be person and person . 
still exist on a `` group '' telegraph_form is a typical peremptory message from location grocer person to person and person ' store in manchester - `` get and send by stage sure four pound best porterhouse or sirloin steak , for person send six sweet_orange '' . 
about 1888 person of location and person become proprietor of the `` group '' , connect all office on the group line and extend over the mountain from location to location , location , location , location , location , location , location , location , location , and location . 
from 1896 until 1910 person be manager of group at the location in the drugstore he purchase from person . 
the village office of group with person as manager and telegrapher continue in person 's drugstore until 1905 . 
during the summer , person often need the assistance of a company_operator . 
these be the year when people flock to manchester not_only to play golf , which had come into vogue , but also to witness the location country_club tournament . 
new_yorker were keep informed of scores by reporter who telegraph fifteen to twenty thousand word daily to the metropolitan newspaper . 
this boost local telegraph business and manchester bask in all the free advertising . 
in 1914 when the town was choose for the group tournament , a representative hurry here from the boston manager 's office . 
in his wake come the person and the cream of the telegraphic profession , ten of boston 's best , choose for their long experience and thorough knowledge of golf . 
during that tournament alone , some 250000 word wing their way out of manchester . 
the old morse system was replace locally by the simplex modern automatic method in 1929 , when person ( person ) be manager of the group office . 
during summer , business be so brisk that person have two assistant and a messenger . 
she was succeed by person . 
since that time the telegraph office has shift in location from the railroad_station at the location and shop at the location back to the town_clerk 's office and drugstore at the village . 
after be located for some year in the location at the group under the supervision of person , it be presently located in the group , location . 
the first known telephone_line in manchester was establish in july 1883 between person and person 's store at location and the group in location . 
this was extend the following year to include the railroad_station agent 's office and location 's hotel at location . 
in november 1887 a line connect several dwelling_house in location was extend to location . 
telephone_wire from person 's house in location to the location lumber job near location be up about 1895 . 
person of location record the set of phone pole in location and location in his diary for 1906 . 
these must have been for local_call strictly , as in may 1900 the `` only long distance telephone '' in town was transfer from person 's to person 's shoe_store . 
a small single switchboard was install in the location over person 's hardware_store ( later person 's ) . 
person be manager and troubleshooter ; person be the first operator ; and a night operator was also employ . 
anyone fortunate enough to have one of those early phone advertise the fact along with the telephone_number in the location . 
in 1918 the group begin erect a building to house its operation on the corner of location and what be now location at location . 
service run through location and to location town east of the mountain be in the hands of the `` group '' in 1925 , but major supervision of telephone_line in manchester be with the group , which eventually gain all control . 
more aerial and underground equipment was install as_well as office improvement to take_care of the expanding business . 
in 1931 person , agent and chief operator , who was to retire in 1946 with thirty year ' service , lead agency office in sale for the year with $ 2490 . 
person , who retire in 1938 , be a veteran of thirty-four years ' local service . 
another veteran telephone_operator be person , who had be in the office forty years at the time of her death in 1960 . 
in 1932 person receive its own exchange , which make business easy for the location office , but it was not until february 1953 that area service was extend to include location and location . 
this eliminate toll_call between the two town . 
within a month , call be up seventy percent . 
electricity play such an important part in community life today that it be difficult to envision a time when current be not available for daily use . 
yet one has to go_back only some sixty year . 
the first mention of an electric plant in manchester seem to be one install in person 's and person 's gristmill on the location in location . 
no record be available as_to the date or extent of installation , but it may have be in 1896 . 
on june_14 , 1900 the manchester_journal report that an electrical_engineer was install an electric_light plant for person at `` location '' . 
this was work by the end of august and give satisfactory service . 
in november 1900 surveying was do under person on the east mountain to ascertain if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate an electric power_plant . 
nothing come of it , perhaps due_to lack of opportunity for water storage . 
the next step be construction by the group of a plant on the west bank of the location south of location bridge . 
this was nearly complete may 23 , 1901 with a promise of light by june 10 , but the first light did not go_on until september 28 . 
it be at the end of the sidewalk in_front of the group cottage . 
the first director of the group be person , person , person , person , and person . 
the officer be person , president ; person , vice_president ; person , treasurer ; and person , secretary . 
person be manager of the company for ten year and manager of its successor company , the group , for one year . 
at about the time the person enterprise was get underway , the group start construction of a chair stock factory on the site of the present group , intend to use its surplus power for generate electricity . 
location then have two compete power_company until 1904 , when the group purchase the transmission system of the group . 
this be fortunate , as the group plant burn in 1905 . 
the group was succeed by the group , which in_turn was absorb by the group . 
the latter now furnish the area with electricity distribute from a modern substation at location which was put into operation february 19 , 1930 and was improve in january 1942 by the installation of larger transformer . 
for a time following the abandonment of the local plant , electric_current for location was bring_in from the south with an emergency tie-in with the group system to_the_north . 
some who have write on utopia have treat it as `` a learned diversion of a learned world '' , `` a phantasy with which person amuse himself '' , `` a holiday work , a spontaneous overflow of intellectual high_spirits , a revel of debate , paradox , comedy and invention '' . 
with_respect_to this view , two point be worth make . 
first , it appear to be based on the fact that on its title_page utopia is describe as `` festivus '' , `` gay '' . 
it overlook the other fact that it is describe as `` nec minus salutaris quam festivus '' , `` no less salutary than gay '' . 
it also overlook the fact that in a rational lexicon , and quite clearly in person 's lexicon , the opposite of serious be not gay but frivolous , and the opposite of gay be not serious but solemn . 
person believe that a man could be both serious and gay . 
that a writer who be gay cannot be serious be a common professional illusion , sedulously foster by all_too many academic who mistakenly believe that their frivolous effort should be take seriously because they are express with that dreary solemnity which be the only mode of expression their author be capable of . 
secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in person 's account of the stupid brutality of early sixteenth century war , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful require a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in person himself . 
indeed , it be even surprising in the canon of group and regius_professor of ecclesiastical history , who father this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant professor of medieval and renaissance_english at cambridge , who inherit it and be now its most eminent proponent . 
but to return to the main line of our inquiry . 
it be doubtful that utopia is still widely read because person be medieval or even because he be a martyr - indeed , it be likely that these day many who read utopia with interest do not even know that its author be a martyr . 
utopia is still widely read because in_a_sense person stand on the margin of modernity . 
and if he did stand on the margin of modernity , it be not in die a martyr for such unity as papal supremacy might be able to force on western christendom . 
it be not even in writing latin epigram , sometimes bawdy ones , or in translate person from greek into latin or in defend the study of greek against the attack of conservative academic , or in attack the conservative theologian who oppose person 's philological study of the new_testament . 
similar literary exercise be the common doing of a christian humanist of the first two decade of the sixteenth century . 
had person 's writing been wholly limited to such exercise , they would be almost as dimly remember as those of a dozen or_so other author live in his time , whose works tenuously survive in the mind of the few hundred scholar who each decade in pursuit of their very specialized occasions read those work . 
person stand on the margin of modernity for one reason alone - because he write utopia . 
and the evidence that he does , indeed , stand there derive quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual reader have respond to that book for the past century or_so . 
only one other contemporary of person 's evoke so immediate and direct a response , and only one other contemporary work - person and the_prince . 
can we discover what it be in utopia that has evoke this response ? 
remember that in seek the modern in utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the renaissance there ; we do not even need to commit ourselves to assess on the same inconceivable scale the relative importance of the medieval , the renaissance , and the modern . 
the medieval be the most important to person because he seek to place person , the author of utopia , in some intelligible relation with person , the martyr . 
to others whose concern it be to penetrate the significance of christian_humanism , the renaissance element be of primary concern . 
but here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation ; we want to know why that book has keep_on sell the way it has ; we want_to know what be perennially new about utopia . 
what be new about it ? 
to that question the answer be simple ; it can be make in two word , utopian communism . 
but it be an answer which open the door wide to an onrush of objection and denial . 
surely there be nothing new about communism . 
we find it in plato 's republic , and in utopia person acknowledge his debt to that book . 
we find it in that `` common way_of_life pleasing to christ and still in_use among the true society of christian '' , that_is , the good monastery which make it easy to convert the utopian to christianity . 
we find it in the later stoic conception of man 's natural condition which include the community of all possession . 
this conception was take_up by the early church_father and by canon lawyer and theologian in the middle_ages ; and person be far too well-read not to have come_across it in one or several of the form thus give it . 
but although the idea of communism be very old even in person 's day and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515 , it be not communism as_such that we are concern with . 
we are concern not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus : 
platonic , stoic , early christian , monastic , canonist or theological communism ; we are concern with utopian communism - that_is , simply communism as it appear in the imaginary commonwealth of utopia , as person conceive it . 
perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity of utopian communism be to contrast it with the principal early type of communistic theory . 
we will achieve a more vivid sense of what it be by realize what it be not . 
in plato 's republic communism be - to speak anachronistically - a communism of janissary . 
its function be to separate from the base ruled mass , among whom private ownership prevail , the governing warrior elite . 
moreover , it is too readily forget that in the republic what give the initial impetus to plato 's excursus into the construction of an imaginary commonwealth with its ruling_class communism of goods , wife , and child , be his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of the individual human psyche ; and it is to this problem that the republic ultimately return . 
in person 's utopia communism be not a means of separate_out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass . 
utopian communism apply to all utopian . 
and in the economy of the book it be not peripheral but central . 
the concern of utopia be with the optimo reipublicae statu , the best ordering of a civil society ; and it is again_and_again make clear that utopian communism provide the institutional array indispensable to that best ordering . 
to derive utopian communism from the jerusalem christian community of the apostolic age or from its medieval successor in spirit , the monastic community , be with an appropriate shift of adjective , misleading in the same way as to derive it from plato 's republic : 
in the republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual athlete , in the apostolic and monastic community with an elite of spiritual and religious athlete . 
the apostolic community be literally an elite : choose by christ himself . 
and the monastic community were supposed to be make_up of volunteer select only after a novitiate which would test their religious aptitude for monastic rigor , their spiritual athleticism . 
finally , the conception of the natural community of all possession which originate with the stoic was firmly fix in a tradition by person 's time , although it was not accept by all the theologian philosopher of the middle_ages . 
in that tradition communism lie a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the fall of man . 
it did not serve to contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order , because the age of innocence be not a possible alternative once man had sin . 
the actual function of patristic civilian canonist scholastic communism was adequately set_forth by person almost a millennium before person write utopia . 
`` the soil be common to all man . 
when we give the necessity of life to the poor , we restore to them what be already theirs . 
we should think_of it more as an act of justice than compassion '' . 
because community not severalty of property be the law_of_nature no man can assert an absolutely unalterable right to what be his . 
indeed , of all that be his every man be by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligated to regard_as himself as a custodian . 
he be a trustee for the common good , however feeble the safeguard which the positive or municipal law of property provide against his misuse of that share of the common fund , wisely or unwisely , entrust to his keeping . 
in_contrast_to this stoic patristic view , utopia imply that the nature of man be such that to rely_on individual conscience to supply the deficiency of municipal law be to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness in a sieve . 
the utopian brace conscience with legal sanction . 
in a properly order society the massive force of public_law perform the function which in natural_law theory ineptly is leave altogether to a small_voice so often still . 
in all the respect just indicate utopian communism differ from previous conception in which community of possession and living play a role . 
neither from one of these conception nor from a combination of them can it be deduce . 
we do not deny originality to the agamemnon because aeschylus find the tale of the house of person among the folklore of the greek . 
in a like sense whatever bit or shred of previous conception one may find in it , utopian communism remain , as an integral whole , original - a new thing . 
it be not merely a new thing ; it be one of the very few new thing in utopia ; most_of the rest be medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism . 
but to say that at a moment in history something be new be not necessarily to say that it be modern ; and for this statement the best evidence come within the five year following the publication of utopia , when person elaborate a new perception of the nature of the divine 's encounter with man . 
new , indeed , be person 's perception , but not modern , as anyone know who has ever try to make intelligible to modern student what person was get at . 
although utopian communism be both new in 1516 and also modern , it be not modern communism or even modern socialism , as they exist or have ever exist in_theory or in_practice . 
consider the feature of utopian communism : 
generous public provision for the infirm ; democratic and secret election of all officer include priest , meal take publicly in common refectory ; a common habit or uniform prescribe for all citizen ; even house change once a decade ; six hour of manual_labor a day for all but a handful of magistrate and scholar , and careful measure to prevent anyone from shirk ; no private_property , no money ; no sort of price at_all for any goods or service , and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term . 
whatever the merit of its intent , utopian communism be far too naive , far too crude , to suit any modern socialist or communist . 
it be not the detail of utopian communism that make utopia modern , it be the spirit , the attitude of mind that inform those detail . 
what that spirit and attitude be we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrast with the communist tradition with the long continuous history , the one which reach christianity by_the_way_of stoicism through the church_father of late antiquity . 
during the person trial the democratic press condemn the proceeding and herald person as a martyr to the principle of the declaration_of_independence . 
during the person trial , however , the state 's most powerful democratic newspaper , the group , state that person be a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his associate , with the assistance of republican and abolitionist , had plot not_only the liberation of the slave but also the overthrow of state_government and federal_government . 
the group answer the group by state that the raid of person be characteristic of democratic act of violence and that `` he was act in direct opposition to the republican_party , who proclaim as one of their cardinal principle that they do not interfere with slavery in the state '' . 
the two major newspaper in providence continue , throughout the crisis , to accuse each other of misrepresent the fact and attempt to falsify history . 
while the group continue to accuse republican and the group continue to accuse democrat , the group complain that the virginia authority show indecent and cowardly haste to condemn person and his men . 
person state , `` of their guilt there can be no_doubt but they are entitle to sufficient time to prepare for trial , and a fair trial '' . 
the group think that there be probably good reason for the haste in which the trial was being conduct and that the only thing gain by a delay would be calm feeling . 
the group state that although the guilt of person be evident , the south must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace . 
on october 31 , 1859 , person was find guilty of treason against the state of virginia , incite slave rebellion , and murder . 
for these crime he was sentence to be hang in_public on friday , december 2 , 1859 . 
upon receive the news , northern writer , editor , and clergyman heap accusation of murder on the southern state , particularly virginia . 
although rhode_islander were prepare for the state election , they watch person 's trial with extreme interest . 
on wednesday morning , november_2 , 1859 , the group state that although person justly deserve the extreme penalty , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the penalty without a fair trial . 
the editor 's main criticism of the trial be the haste with which it was conduct . 
the reader of the group , however , learn that it was generally concede that `` person '' have a fair trial . 
concern the sentence the editor ask , `` what else can virginia do than to hang the man who have defy her law , organize treason , and butcher her citizen '' . 
in the eastern section of the state the newspaper ' reaction to person 's trial and sentence be basically identical . 
person , editor of the group state that `` the end of justice must be satisfy , a solitary example must be set , in_order_that all those misname philanthropist [ sic ] , who , actuate by a blind zeal , dare to instigate riot , treason , and murder , may heed it and shape their future course accordingly '' . 
the editor of the group could discover no evidence of extenuate circumstance in the person trial which would warrant make an exception to the infliction of capital_punishment . 
in direct_contrast to the other rhode_island editor , person of the group outwardly condemn the trial as be completely unfair . 
concern the sentence , person write , `` if it be possible that mercy shall override vengeance and that person 's sentence shall be commute to imprisonment , it would be well - well for the country and for virginia '' . 
despite the excitement being cause by the trial and sentence of person , rhode_islander turn their attention to the state election . 
the state had elect republican candidate in the past two year . 
there be no_doubt as_to the control the group exercise throughout the state . 
if it fail on_occasion to elect its candidate for general state office by majority , the failure be due_to a lingering remnant of the know-nothing party , which call itself the american group . 
the person and the republican both nominate lieutenant_governor person for governor . 
person be the democratic candidate . 
the result of the election of 1859 find republican candidate not_only win the office of governor and lieutenant_governor but also obtain the two congressional office from the eastern and western section of the state . 
during the month of november hardly_a day pass when there be not some mention of person in the rhode_island newspaper . 
on november 7 , 1859 , the group reprint a letter send to person from `` person '' , a quaker lady in newport . 
in reference_to person 's raid she write , `` though we be non-resistant and religiously believe it better to reform by moral and not by carnal weapon we know thee was animate [ sic ] by the most generous and philanthropic motive '' . 
`` person '' compare person to moses in_that they were both act to deliver millions from oppression . 
in contrast to `` person '' , most rhode_islander hardly think_of person as be another person . 
most attempt to develop any sympathy for person and his action find an unresponsive audience in rhode_island . 
on wednesday evening , november 23 , 1859 , in location , person of location , give a `` mission_of_sympathy '' lecture in which he favorably view the location insurrection . 
the group state that many of person 's remark be inappropriate and savor strongly of radicalism and fanaticism . 
in its account of the person lecture , the group say that the remark of person make the people indignant . 
no sympathy or admiration for person could be find in the group , for the editor claim that there be a score of man in the state_prison who be a_thousand time more deserving of sympathy . 
the group , however , state that person 's courage , bravery , and heroism `` in a good cause would make a man a martyr ; it give something of dignity even to a bad one '' . 
the group admit that person might deserve punishment or imprisonment `` but he should no_more be hang than person or person '' . 
the group exhibit more concern over the possibility of the abolitionist make a martyr of person than it did over the development of sympathy for him . 
in her letter to person , `` person '' , the quakeress from newport , had suggest that the american people owe more honor to person for seek to free the slave than they did to person . 
during the latter day of november to the day of person 's execution , it seem that most rhode_islander did not concur in `` person 's '' suggestion . 
on november 22 , 1859 , the group state that although person 's `` pluck '' and honest fanaticism must be admire , any honor pay to person would only induce other fanatic to imitate his action . 
a week later the group had discover the initial plan of some providence citizen to hold a meeting honor person on the day of his execution . 
the editor of the group warn , `` that if such a demonstration be make , it will not find support or countenance from any of the man whose name are recognize as have a right to speak_for providence '' . 
the group 's editor write that he could not believe that a meeting honor person was to be hold in providence . 
he further call_upon the people of providence to rebuke the meeting and avoid disgrace . 
on december 2 , 1859 , person was hang at location , virginia . 
extraordinary precaution were take so that no stranger be allow_in the city and no citizen within the enclosure surround the scaffold . 
in many northern town and city meeting were hold and church_bell were toll . 
such be not the case in rhode_island . 
the only public demonstration in honor of person was hold at location in location , on the day of his execution . 
despite the opposition of the city newspaper , the location meeting `` bring_together a very respectable audience , compose in part of those who had been distinguish for year for their radical view upon the subject of slavery , of many_of our colored citizen , and of those who were attract to the place by the novelty of such a gathering '' . 
seat on the platform were person , ex-mayor of providence and a wealthy republican stove manufacturer ; person , an uncompromising person ; the person , a unitarian minister ; the person , a free_will baptist ; person , and person . 
the latter two be appointed secretary . 
the first speaker be person who had been unanimously choose president of the meeting . 
he speak of his desire to promote the abolition of slavery by peaceable means and he compare person of location to the person of rhode_island 's colonial period . 
person conclude that as rhode_island 's person become a canonized hero , if not a saint , so would it be with person of location . 
the next speaker be person . 
although admit person 's guilt on legal grounds , person say that , `` person be no common criminal ; his deed be not below , but above the law '' . 
following person be person who speak of his disapproval of person 's attempt at servile insurrection , his admiration of person 's character , and his opposition to slavery . 
person 's remark were applaud by a portion of the audience several time and once there be hissing . 
the fourth and last speaker be person . 
by this time large_number of the audience had leave the hall . 
person commence his remark by an allusion to the general feeling of opposition which the meeting had encounter from many of the citizen and all the newspaper of the city . 
he say that the propriety or impropriety of such a gathering be a question that was to be settle by every man in accordance with the conviction of private judgment . 
in the remainder of his speech person speak of his admiration for person and warn those who take_part in the meeting that they `` be liable to the charge that they are supporting traitor and uphold man whom the law have condemn '' . 
he recall that in rhode_island a party opposed to the state 's condemnation of a man ( person ) proclaim the state 's action as a violation of the law of the land and the principle of human liberty . 
at the close of person ' speech the following preamble and resolution were read by the president , and on the question of their adoption pass unanimously : 
whereas , person has cheerfully risk his life in endeavor to deliver those who are deny all right and is this day doom to suffer death for his effort in behalf of those who have no helper : 
therefore , 
resolve that , while we most decidedly disapprove the method he adopt to accomplish his object , yet in his willingness to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom , we still recognize the quality of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit which true man have always admire and which history never fail to honor . 
resolve that his wrong and bereavement in kansas , occasion by the violence and brutality of those who be intent_on the propagation of slavery in that territory , call_for a charitable judgment upon his recent effort in virginia to undermine the despotism from which he had suffer , and commend his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice . 
resolve that the anti slavery sentiment is become ripe for resolute action . 
resolve , that we find in this fearful tragedy at location a reason for more earnest effort to remove the evil of slavery from the whole land as speedily as possible . 
on the morning following the location meeting the editor of the group write that although the meeting be mild and less extreme than those hold in other area for similar purpose , it could have been avoid completely . 
rather than being deceive , the eye is puzzle ; instead of see object in space , it see nothing more than - a picture . 
through 1911 and 1912 , as the cubist facet_plane 's tendency to adhere to the literal surface become hard and hard to deny , the task of keep the surface at arm's_length fall all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivance . 
to reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , person and person begin to mix sand and other foreign substance with their paint ; the granular texture thus create likewise called_attention_to the reality of the surface and be effective over much larger area . 
in certain other picture , however , person begin to paint area in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . 
these area by_virtue_of their abrupt density of pattern , state the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drive the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescue - and set to shuttle again - only by conventional perspective ; that_is , by being place in such relation to the form depict within the illusion that these form leave no room for the typography except near the surface . 
the accumulation of such device , however , soon have the effect of telescope , even while separate , surface and depth . 
the process of flatten seem inexorable , and it become necessary to emphasize the surface still further in_order to prevent it from fuse with the illusion . 
it was for this reason , and no other that i can see , that in september 1912 , person take the radical and revolutionary step of paste actual piece of imitation woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of try to simulate its texture in paint . 
person say that he himself had already make his first collage toward the end of 1911 , when he glue a piece of imitation caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas . 
it is true that his first collage look more analytical_cubism than person 's , which would confirm the date he assign it . 
but it is also true that person be the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated texture as_well_as of typography ; and moreover , he had already begin to broaden and simplify the facet_plane of analytical_cubism as far back as the end of 1910 . 
when we examine what each master say be his first collage we see that much the same thing happen in each . 
( it makes no real difference that person 's collage be on_paper and eke_out in charcoal , while person 's be on canvas and eke_out in oil . ) 
by its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness , the affixed paper or cloth serve for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated texture had ever do . 
but here again , the surface declare device both overshoot and fall_short_of its aim . 
for the illusion of depth create by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else give_way immediately to an illusion of form in bas_relief , which give_way in_turn , and with equal immediacy , to an illusion that seem to contain both - or neither . 
because of the size of the area it cover , the pasted paper establish undepicted flatness bodily , as more than an indication or sign . 
literal flatness now tend to assert itself as the main event of the picture , and the device boomerang : the illusion of depth is render even more precarious than before . 
instead of isolate the literal flatness by specify and circumscribe it , the pasted paper or cloth release and spread it , and the artist seem to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with which to finish as_well_as start his picture . 
the actual surface become both ground and background , and it turn_out - suddenly and paradoxically - that the only place leave for a three-dimensional illusion be in_front of , upon , the surface . 
in their very first collage , person and person draw or paint over and on the affixed paper or cloth , so that certain_of the principal feature of their subject as depict seem to thrust_out into real , bas_relief space - or to be about to do so - while the rest of the subject remain imbed in , or flat upon , the surface . 
and the surface is driven back , in its very surfaceness , only by this contrast . 
in the upper center of person 's first collage , fruit_dish ( in person 's collection ) , a bunch of grape is render with such conventionally vivid sculptural effect as to lift it practically off the picture_plane . 
the trompe_l'oeil illusion here is no_longer enclose between parallel flatness , but seem to thrust through the surface of the drawing_paper and establish depth on top of_it . 
yet the violent immediacy of the wallpaper strip paste to the paper , and the only lesser immediacy of block_capital that simulate window lettering , manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture_plane so that it does not `` jump '' . 
at_the_same_time , the wallpaper strip themselves seem to be push into depth by the line and patch of shading charcoal upon them , and by their placement in_relation_to the block_capital ; and these capital seem in_turn to be push_back by their placement , and by contrast with the corporeality of the woodgraining . 
thus every part and plane of the picture keep change place in relative depth with every_other part and plane ; and it be as if the only stable relation leave among the different part of the picture be the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each have with the surface . 
and the same thing , more_or_less , can be say of the content of person 's first collage . 
in later collage of both master , a variety of extraneous material are use , sometimes in the same work , and almost always in_conjunction_with every other eye-deceiving and eye-undeceiving device they can think_of . 
the area adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed material - or simply of a painted in form - will be shade to pry that edge away from the surface , while something will be draw , paint or even paste over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth . 
plane define as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space , and a depth is suggest optically which be greater than that establish pictorially . 
all this expand the oscillation between surface and depth so_as to encompass fictive space in_front of the surface as_well_as behind it . 
flatness may now monopolize everything , but it be a flatness become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn_into illusion itself - at_least an optical if_not , properly_speaking , a pictorial illusion . 
depict , cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilate to the literal , undepicted kind , but at_the_same_time it react upon and largely transform the undepicted kind - and it does so , moreover , without deprive the latter of its literalness ; rather , it underpin and reinforce that literalness , re-create it . 
out of_this re-created literalness , the group subject re-emerge . 
for it had turn_out , by a further paradox of cubism , that the means to an illusion of depth and plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation or imaging . 
in the analytical_cubism phase of their cubism , person and person had not_only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply in_order to preserve it ; they had also had to generalize it - to the point , finally , where the illusion of depth and relief become abstracted from specific three-dimensional entity and was render largely as the illusion of depth and relief as_such : as a disembodied attribute and expropriated property detach from everything not itself . 
in_order to be save , plasticity had had to be isolate ; and as the aspect of the subject was transpose into those cluster of more_or_less interchangeable and contour obliterating facet_plane by which plasticity was isolate under the cubist method , the subject itself become largely unrecognizable . 
cubism , in its 1911 - 1912 phase ( which the_french , with justice , call `` hermetic '' ) be on the verge of abstract_art . 
it was then that person and person were confront with a unique dilemma : they had to choose between illusion and representation . 
if they opt_for illusion , it could only be illusion per_se - an illusion of depth , and of relief , so general and abstracted as to exclude the representation of individual object . 
if , on_the_other_hand , they opt_for representation , it had to be representation per_se - representation as image pure_and_simple , without connotation ( at_least , without more than schematic ones ) of the three-dimensional space in which the object represent originally exist . 
it was the collage that make the term of_this dilemma clear : the representational could be restore and preserve only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation had become , for_the_first_time , mutually_exclusive alternative . 
in_the_end , person and person plump_for the representational , and it would seem they did so deliberately . 
( this provide whatever real justification there be for the talk about `` reality '' . ) 
but the inner , formal_logic of cubism , as it work_out itself out through the collage , had just as much to do with shape their decision . 
when the smaller facet_plane of analytical_cubism were place upon or juxtapose with the large , dense shape form by the affixed material of the collage , they had to coalesce - become `` synthesize '' - into larger planar shape themselves simply in_order to maintain the integrity of the picture_plane . 
leave in their previous atomlike smallness , they would have cut_away too abruptly into depth ; and the broad , opaque shape of pasted paper would have been isolate in such a way as to make them jump_out of plane . 
large plane juxtapose with other large plane tend to assert themselves as independent shape , and to_the_extent that they be flat , they also assert themselves as silhouette ; and independent silhouette be apt to coincide with the recognizable contour of the subject from which a picture start ( if it does start from a subject ) . 
it was because of this chain_reaction as_much_as for any other reason - that_is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape - that the identity of depicted_object , or at_least part of them , re-emerge in person 's and person 's papiers colles and continue to remain more conspicuous there - but only as flattened silhouette - than in any of their painting do wholly in oil before the end of 1913 . 
analytical_cubism come to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; nor did synthetic_cubism fully begin there . 
only when the collage had been exhaustively translate into oil , and transform by this translation , did cubism become an affair of positive color and flat , interlocking silhouette whose legibility and placement create allusion to , if_not the illusion of , unmistakable three-dimensional identity . 
synthetic_cubism begin with person alone , late in 1913 or early in 1914 ; this be the_point at which he finally take the lead in cubist innovation away from person , never again to relinquish it . 
but even before that , person had glimpse and enter , for a moment , a certain revolutionary path in which no one had precede him . 
it was as though , in_that instant , he had feel the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly try to escape all_the_way back - or forward - to literal three-dimensionality . 
this he did by use utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage ( and of cubism in_general ) literally into the literal space in_front of the picture_plane . 
some time in 1912 , person cut_out and fold a piece_of_paper in the shape of a guitar ; to this he glue and fit other piece_of_paper and four taut string , thus create a sequence of flat surface in real and sculptural space to which there cling only the vestige of a picture_plane . 
the affixed element of collage were extrude , as_it_were , and cut_off from the literal pictorial surface to form a bas_relief . 
( los_angeles in 1957 finally bow to the skyscraper . ) 
and without high density in the core , rapid_transit system cannot be maintain economically , let_alone build from_scratch at today 's price . 
however , the building of freeway and garage cannot continue forever . 
the new interchange among the four los_angeles freeway , include the grade-constructed access , occupy by itself no less than eighty acre of downtown land , one-eighth of a square_mile , an area about the size of group in new_york . 
it be hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete constitute what the law call `` the highest and best use '' of centrally located urban land . 
as it affect the city 's fiscal situation , such an interchange be ruinous ; it remove forever from the tax roll property which should be tax to pay for the city services . 
subway improve land value without take_away land ; freeway boost valuation less ( because the garage they require be not prime building by_a_long_shot ) , and reduce the acreage that can be tax . 
downtown los_angeles be already two-thirds freeway , interchange , street , parking_lot and garage - one of those preposterous `` if '' statistic has already come to pass . 
the freeway with narrowly spaced interchange concentrate and mitigate the access problem , but it also act_as inevitably as an artificial , isolate boundary . 
city planner do not always use this boundary as effectively as they might . 
less ambitious freeway plan may be more successful - especially when the roadway and interchange are raised , allow_for cross access at many point and provide parking_area below the ramp . 
meanwhile , the automobile and its friend the truck have cost the central_city some of its industrial dominance . 
in ever great number , factory are locate in the suburb or in `` industrial_park '' removed from the city 's political jurisdiction . 
the appeal of the suburb be particularly strong for heavy industry , which must move bulky object along a lengthy assembly_line and want enough land_area to do the entire job on one floor . 
to light industry , the economy of be on one floor be much slight , but efficiency_engineer usually believe_in them , and manufacturer look_for way to cut cost cannot be prevent from turn_to efficiency_engineer . 
this movement of industry away from the central_city be not so catastrophically new as some prophet seem to believe . 
it be merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which form the pattern of virtually all american city . 
the big factory which be relatively near the center of our city - the rubber factory in location , group 's detroit plant , group 's pittsburgh works - often begin on these site at_a_time when that be the edge of the city , yet close to transport ( river ) , storage ( pier ) and power ( river ) . 
the `` leapfrog '' be a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam_turbine , and the time when the belt of residence surround the old factory area be not_yet blighted . 
the truck and the car give the manufacturer a new degree_of_freedom in select his plant site . 
until internal_combustion become cheap , he had_to be near a railroad_siding and a trolley_line or an existing large community of lower-class home . 
the railroad_siding be still important - it be usually , though not always , true that long_haul shipment by rail be cheap than trucking . 
but anybody who promise a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these day , and many business can live without the railroad . 
and there be now many million of worker for whom the factory with the big parking_lot , which can be reach by drive across or against the usual pattern of rush_hour traffic and grille route bus_line , be actually more convenient than the walk-to factory . 
group , group 's enormous installation at location and location , the pentagon , group in location , group and group in los_angeles , the new automobile assembly plant everywhere - none of these is substantially serve by any sort of conventional mass_rapid_transit . 
they be all suburban plant , rely_on the road to keep them supply with worker . 
and wherever the new thruway go_up their bank are lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry . 
the drive along massachusetts ' location , the bypass which make an arc about twenty mile from downtown boston , may be a vision of the future . 
the future could be worse . 
the plant along location are mostly well designed and nicely set against the new_england rock and tree . 
they can even be rather grand , like person 's monument to the astonishing success of group . 
but they deny the value of the city - the crowded , competitive , tolerant city , the `` melting_pot '' which give_off so many of the most admirable american quality . 
they be segregated business , combine again on one site the factory and the office , draw their work_force from segregated community . 
it be interesting to note how many of the plant on massachusetts ' location draw most of their income either from the government in noncompetitive cost-plus arrangement , or from the exploitation of patent which grant at_least a partial monopoly . 
while the factory be always the center of the labor_market , they be often on the city 's periphery . 
in spread the factory even farther , the automobile may not have change to any great extent the growth pattern of the city . 
even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt 's motel has be relatively painless ; the hotel-motel demarcation is become hard to find every_year . 
what hurt most be the damage the automobile has do to central_city retailing , especially in those city where public_transit be feeble . 
some retailing , of_course , always spread with the population - grocery_store , drugstore , local haberdashery and dress_shop , candy_store and the_like . 
but whenever a major purchase was contemplate forty year ago - a new bedroom_set or a winter coat , an easter bonnet , a bicycle for junior - the family set_off for the downtown department_store , where the selection would be greatest . 
department_store congregate in the `` one_hundred percent location '' , where all the transit_line converge . 
these store be still there , but the volume of the `` downtown store '' has be on a relative decline , while in many city the suburban `` branch '' sell more_and_more drygoods . 
if the retailer and hotelman 's downtown unit sale have been decrease , however , his dollar_volume continue to rise , and it is dollar which you put_in the bank . 
in most discussion of this phenomenon , the figure be substantially inflated . 
no suburban shopping_center branch - not even hudson 's vast northland outside detroit - do anything like the unit volume of business or carry anything like the variety of merchandise to be find in the home store . 
telephone_order distort the picture : 
the suburbanite naturally call a local rather_than a central city number if both are list in an advertisement , especially if the local_call eliminate city sales_tax . 
the suburban branch is thereby credit with a sale which would have been make even if its glass door had never open . 
accounting procedure which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branch seem more profitable than they be . 
in many case that statement `` we break_even on our downtown operation and make money on our branch '' would be turn_around if the cost_analysis were recalculate on terms less prejudicial to the old store . 
fear of the competition - always a great motivating force in the american economy - make retailer who do not have suburban operation exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of their rival 's shiny new branch . 
the fact seem to be that very many large branch store be uneconomical , that the choice of location in the suburb be as important as it be downtown , and that even highly suburbanized city will support only so many big branch . 
moreover , the cost of operation be always high in any new store , as the conservative banker who act_as controller for retail giant are begin to discover . 
when all has been say , however , the big branch store remain a major break with history in the development of american retailing . 
just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car , the trip to the shopping_center may seem far easy than to the downtown department_store , though both be the same distance from home . 
indeed , there be some city where the suburban shopping pull customer who be geographically much near to downtown . 
person report that resident of location have been drive across the mississippi , through the heart of downtown st._louis and out to the western suburb for major shopping , simply because parking be easy at the big branch than it be in the heart of town . 
to the extent that the problem be merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of group in columbus , ohio , can fight_back successfully by build a garage on the lot next_door . 
if the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frighten_away from downtown by traffic problem , however , the city store can only pressure the politician to do something about the highway or await the completion of the federal highway program . 
and if the affection for the suburban branch reflect a desire to shop with `` nice people '' , rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which support the downtown department_store , the central location may be in serious trouble . 
today , according_to land economist person , shopping_center and their associated parking_lot cover some 46000 acre of land , which be almost exactly the total land_area in all the nation 's central business_district put together . 
the downtown store continue to offer the great inducement of variety , both within its gate and across the street , where other department_store be immediately convenient for the shopper who want to see what be available before make_up_one's_mind . 
if anything may be predict in the quicksilver world of retailing , it seem likely that the suburban branch will come to dominate child 's clothing ( take the kid downtown be too_much of a production ) , household gadgetry and the discount_business in big-ticket item . 
department_store were build_on drygoods , especially lady ' fashions , and in this area , in_the_long_run , the suburban branch will be hard_put to compete against downtown . 
if this analysis be correct , the suburban branch will turn_out to be what management 's cost_accountant refuse to acknowledge , marginal operation rather_than major factor . 
historically in america the appeal of city has be their color and life , the variety of experience they offer . 
`` how ya gonna keep ' em down on the farm '' ? 
be a question that had to be ask long before they see paree . 
though american usually live in group segregate by national origin or religious_belief , they like to work and shop in the noise and vitality of downtown . 
only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central_city would be likely to destroy this preference - and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change , gloomily foresee by so many urban diagnostician , be actually upon us . 
in their book american_skyline , person and person argue that person 's new_deal be what make the modern suburb a possibility - a fine ironical argument , when you consider how suburbanite tend to vote . 
the first superhighway - new_york 's location and chicago 's location , san_francisco 's location and its approach , a good slice of the location - were build as part of the federal works_program which was going_to cure the depression . 
at_the_same_time , person 's federal_housing_administration , couple with person 's cheap_money policy , permit ordinary lower-middle-class family to build their own home . 
banker who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house itself get that security from the u.s. government ; householder who had been unable to pick_up the burden of short-term high interest mortgage find they could borrow for twenty-five year at 4 percent , under government aegis . 
in the midwest , oxidation pond are use extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban area . 
the high cost of land and a_few operational problem result from excessive loading have create the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristic of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume . 
research at location missouri on oxidation pond has show that the bod in the treated effluent vary from 30 to 53 mg / l with loading from 8 to 120 lb bod / day / acre . 
since experience indicate that effluent from oxidation pond do not create major problem at these bod concentration , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system be the same as from conventional oxidation pond . 
recent study by person and person had indicate that a turbine aerator could be add to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer . 
their study show that it be possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen / hr / hp . 
person and person discuss the use of aerated lagoon for treat organic waste . 
they indicate that a 4 - day retention , aerated lagoon would give 60 to 76 percent bod reduction . 
later , person increase the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 percent in the summer month . 
it appear from the limited information available that the aerated lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increase the capacity of existing oxidation pond as_well as provide the same degree of treatment in a smaller volume . 
with the development of the group south of kansas_city , missouri , the developer was face with the problem of provide adequate sewage_disposal . 
the sewage_system from kansas_city was not expect to serve the location area for several year . 
this necessitate the construction of temporary sewage treatment facility with an expected life from 5 to 15 yr . 
for the initial development an oxidation pond was construct as show in figure 1 . 
the oxidation pond have a surface_area of 4.77 acre and a depth of 4 foot . 
the pond is currently serve 1230 person or 260 person per acre . 
in the summer of 1960 the oxidation pond become completely septic and emit obnoxious odor . 
it be possible to maintain aerobic condition in the pond by regular addition of sodium_nitrate until the temperature decrease and the algae population change from blue-green_algae to green_algae . 
the anaerobic condition in the existing oxidation pond necessitate examination of other method for supply additional oxygen than by sodium_nitrate . 
at_the_same_time further expansion in the group require the construction of additional sewage treatment facility . 
the large land_area require for oxidation pond make this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer . 
it was propose that aerated lagoon be use to eliminate the problem at the existing oxidation pond and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional development . 
the lack of adequate data on the aerated lagoon system prompt the developer to construct an aerated lagoon pilot plant to determine its feasibility for treat domestic sewage . 
the pilot plant be a circular lagoon 81 foot in diam at the surface and 65 foot in diam at the bottom , 4 foot below the surface , with a volume of 121000 gal . 
the side slope were coat with fiberglass matting coat with asphalt to prevent erosion . 
the pilot lagoon was locate as show in figure 1 to serve the area just south of the existing housing area . 
the major contributor be a shopping_center with house being add to the system as the subdivision develop . 
the pilot lagoon was design to handle the waste from 314 person with a 4 - day aeration period . 
initially , the wastewater would be entirely from the shopping_center with the domestic sewage from the house increase over an 18 - month period . 
this operation would permit evaluation of the pilot plant , with a slowly increase load , over a reasonable period_of_time . 
the pilot plant was equip with a 3 - hp turbine aerator ( figure 2 ) . 
the aerator have a variable speed drive to permit operation through a range of speed . 
the sewage flow into the treatment plant was meter and continuously record on 24 - hr chart . 
the raw sewage was introduce directly under the turbine aerator to insure maximum mixing of the raw sewage with the aeration tank content . 
the effluent was collect through two pipe and discharge to the blue_river through a surface drainage_ditch . 
composite sample were collect at weekly interval . 
the long retention period and the complete mixing concept prevent rapid change in either the mixed liquor or in the effluent . 
weekly sample would make any change more readily discernible than daily sample . 
the composite sample were normally collect over a 6 - hr period , but an occasional 24 - hr composite was make . 
examination of the operation of the shopping_center permit correlation of the 6 - hr composite sample with 24 - hr operation . 
the data indicate that the organic load during the 6 - hr composite be essentially 50 percent of the 24 - hr organic load . 
grab_sample were collect from the existing oxidation pond to determine its operating condition . 
efforts were make to take the grab_sample at random period so that the mass of data could be treat as a 6 - hr composite sample . 
a single 24 - hr composite sample indicate that the sewage flow pattern and characteristic be typical . 
the bod of the influent to the pilot plant vary between 110 and 710 mg / l with an average of 350 mg / l . 
this be equivalent_to 240 mg / l bod on a 24 - hr basis . 
the bod of the raw sewage be typical of domestic sewage from a subdivision . 
the bod in the effluent average 58 mg / l , a 76 - percent reduction over the 24 - hr period . 
examination of the data in table 1 , show that a_few sample contribute to raise the effluent bod . 
the period of high effluent bod occur during cold period when operational problem with the aerator result . 
ice cause the aerator to overload , strain the drive belt . 
the slippage of the drive belt cause the aerator to slow_down and reduce oxygen transfer as_well_as the mixing of the raw sewage . 
the organic loading on the unit average 32 lb of bod / day or about 2 lb bod / day 1000 cu_ft aeration capacity . 
needless to say , the organic load be very low on a volumetric basis , but be 270 lb bod / day / acre on a surface loading basis . 
it seem that the aerated lagoon be a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly loaded activated sludge system . 
the flow_rate remain relatively constant during the winter month as show in table 1 , . 
with the spring rain the flow rise rapidly due_to infiltration in open sewer . 
as construction progress , the volume of storm drainage will be sharply reduce . 
the retention period in the aerated lagoon range from 9.8 to 2.6 day , average 6.4 day . 
the large amount of vegetable grinding from the grocery_store in the shopping_center create a suspended solid problem . 
the vegetable were not readily metabolize by the bacteria in the aeration unit and tend to float on the surface . 
a skimming device at the effluent weir prevent loss of most of these light solid . 
the average volatile suspended solid in the effluent be 75 mg / l while mlss average 170 mg / l volatile suspended solid . 
the average sludge age base on displacement of solid was calculate to be 14.5 day . 
the oxygen uptake rate in the mixed liquor average 0.8 mg / l / hr during the first four month of this study . 
variation in aerator speed during the latter two month of this study cause increased mixing and increased oxygen demand . 
the increase in oxygen uptake rate from 1.2 to 2.6 mg / l / hr which follow an increase in rotor speed was believe to be related to resuspension of solid which had settle at the low rotor speed . 
it appear that most of the mixed liquor suspend solid be active microbial solid with the heavy , less active solid settle out . 
the suspended solid discharge in the effluent were find to be the major source of the bod . 
removal of the suspended solid by a membrane filter yield an average effluent contain only 20 mg / l bod . 
the bod in the drainage_ditch receive the pilot plant effluent average 12 mg / l . 
this low bod be_due to removal of the excess suspended solid by sedimentation since the only dilution be surface runoff which be very low during this study . 
routine microscopic examination were make of the mixed liquor as indicate by person and person for the various type of protozoa . 
it was find that the aerated lagoon be an activated sludge system rather_than an oxidation pond . 
at no time were algae find in the mixed liquor . 
the bacteria form typical activated sludge floc . 
the floc particle be all small as the heavy floc settle out . 
initially , the flagellated_protozoan predominate , but they soon give_way to the free-swimming ciliated_protozoan . 
as the temperature decrease , the number of free-swimming ciliated_protozoan decrease . 
very little protozoa activity exist below 40 ` f . 
when the temperature reach 32 ` f all protozoan activity cease ; but as the temperature rise , the number of protozoa increase rapidly . 
only once were stalked ciliate find in the mixed liquor . 
the predomination of free-swimming ciliated_protozoan be indicative_of a high bacterial population . 
one of the important aspect of_this study was to determine the oxygen transfer relationship of the mechanical aerator . 
routine determination were make for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen uptake rate . 
the data give in table 2 , show the routine operation of the aerator . 
the dissolved oxygen in the aeration unit be consistently high until january 29 , 1961 . 
an extended cold_spell cause ice to build_up on the aerator which was mount on a floating platform and cause the entire platform to sink low in the water . 
the added resistance to the rotor damage the drive belt and reduce the oxygen transfer capacity . 
it be approximately one month before the belt problem was notice and correct , but at no time be there a deficiency of dissolved oxygen . 
a series of eight special test were conduct at different rotor speed to determine the oxygen transfer rate . 
five of the test were conduct with a polyethylene cover to simulate an ice cover . 
the rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 - mg / l dissolved oxygen concentration and 10 ` c for various rotor speed is give in table 3 , . 
the maximum rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 mg / l dissolved oxygen was calculate as 220 lb / day at a maximum rate of 9.3 mg / l / hr . 
the actual power requirement indicate 2 lb oxygen transfer / hr / hp . 
the polyethylene cover reduce the oxygen transfer rate by 10 percent , indicate that the maximum oxygen transfer be at the rotor rather_than through the surface . 
during this study septic condition develop in the oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melt . 
shortly after this study end septic condition result which require the addition of sodium_nitrate . 
the location of the oxidation pond in a high value residential area make odor nuisance a sensitive problem for the developer . 
the organic concentration in the influent raw sewage range from 160 to 270 mg / l of bod with an average of 230 mg / l . 
the bod data are give in table 4 , . 
a single 24 - hr composite sample have a bod of 260 mg / l , indicate a typical domestic sewage . 
the daily sewage volume to the oxidation pond average 147000 gpd , give a retention period of 42 day . 
the organic loading on the pond be slightly under 60 lb bod / day / acre . 
the effluent bod average 34 mg / l , a_little low than that of the study at location indicate for a loading of 60 lb bod / day / acre . 
the bod of the effluent range from a minimum of 13 to a maximum of 47 mg / l . 
microscopic examination of the effluent show that minimum bod occur when the algae begin to decrease with cold_weather . 
when the algae begin to build_up again , the effluent bod rise . 
during the two_weeks when the algae disappear from the effluent bod 's in the effluent be 18 and 16 mg / l . 
person did not go_back to school . 
his parent talk seriously and lengthily to their own doctor and to a specialist at the group - person be entitled to a discount for member of his family - and it was decide it would be best for him to take_off the remainder of the term off , spend a_lot of time in bed and , for the rest , do pretty_much as he choose - provided , of_course , he choose to do nothing too exciting or too debilitating . 
his teacher and his school_principal were confer_with and everyone agree that , if he keep_up with a certain amount of work at home , there be little danger of his lose a term . 
person accept the decision with indifference and did not enter the argument . 
he was discharge from the hospital after a two day checkup and he and his parent have what person describe as a `` celebration lunch '' at the cafeteria on the campus . 
person wear a smart hat and , because she had been warn recently about smoking , puff at her cigarette through a long ivory holder stained with lipstick . 
person 's father sit sprawled in his chair , angular , alert as a cricket , look about at the huge stainless_steel appointment of the room with an expression of proprietorship . 
teacher - man who wear brown suit and have gray hair and pleasant smile - come to their table to talk_shop and to be introduce to person and person . 
person be polite , person indifferent . 
they eat the cafeteria food with its orange sauce and person gaze without interest at his food , the teacher , the heroic baronial window , and the bright rank of college banner . 
his father try to make the food a topic . 
`` the blueberry_pie be good , person . 
i recommend it '' . 
he look at his son , his face worried . 
person murmur , `` no , thanks '' , so softly his father had_to bend his gaunt height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him . 
person regard the ear and the grizzled hair around it with a moment of interest . 
he say more loudly , `` i'm full , old pop '' . 
he had eat almost nothing on the crested , three sectioned plate and had drink about half the milk in its paper container . 
`` he's all_right , person '' , person say . 
`` i can fix him something later in the afternoon when we get home '' . 
since his seizure , person had have little appetite ; yet his changed appearance , surprisingly , be one of plumpness . 
his face be full ; his lip and the usually sharp line of his jaw had become swollen look . 
he breathe now with his mouth open , show a whitely curving section of lower tooth ; he keep his eye , with their puffed blurred lid , always lowered , though not , apparently , focusing . 
even his neck seem thick and therefore short . 
his hand , which had be as quick as a pair of fluttering bird , be now neither active nor really relaxed . 
they lie on his lap , palm up , stiffly motionless , the tapered finger a_little thick at the joint . 
altogether he have , since the seizure , the appearance of a boy who overindulge in food and take no exercise . 
he look lazy , spoiled , a_little querulous . 
person have little to say . 
she greet her husband 's colleague with smiling politeness , offer nothing . 
person , for all his sprawling and his easy familiarity , be completely alert to his son , eye always on the still face , jump to anticipate person desire . 
it be a strained , silent lunch . 
person say , `` i 'd_better get him to bed '' . 
the doctor had suggest person remain most of every afternoon in bed until he be strong . 
since person had to give a lecture , person and person drive home alone in the plymouth . 
they did not speak much . 
person gaze out at ugly gray slum and say softly , `` look at those stupid kid '' . 
it be a negro section of peeling row_house , storefront church and ragged child . 
person had to bend toward person and ask him to repeat . 
he say , `` nothing '' . 
and_then : `` there be lots of kid around here '' . 
person look at the child , his mouth slightly opened , his eye dull . 
he feel tired and full and calm . 
the day seem short , perhaps because his routine be , each_day , almost the same . 
he rise late and go_down in his bathrobe and slipper to have breakfast either alone or with person . 
person treat him with_attention and try to tempt his appetite with special food : biscuit , cookie , candy - the result of devoted hour in the tiled kitchen . 
she would hover over him and , look_like her brother , anxiously watch the progress of person 's fork or spoon . 
`` you do n't eat enough , honey . 
try to get_down that down '' . 
person , observe , would say , `` he has_to rediscover his own capacity . 
it 'll take time '' . 
person and person talk to each other quietly now , as ally who be political rather_than natural might in a war atmosphere . 
both watch person constantly , person without seem to , person openly , her eye fill with concern . 
person be neutral . 
he did not resent their supervision or person 's sometimes tiring sympathy . 
he eat what he feel_like , sleep as much or as little as he please , and move about the draughty room of the house , when he be not in bed , with slow dubious step , like an elderly tourist in a cathedral . 
his energy be go . 
he be able , now , to sit for hour in a chair in the living_room and stare out at the bleak yard without move . 
his hand lie loosely , yet stiffly - they be like wax hand : almost lifelike , not quite - fold in his lap ; his mouth hang slightly open . 
when he was ask a question or address in such a way that some response be inescapable , he would answer ; if , as often happen , he had to repeat because he had speak too softly , he would repeat his word in the same way , without emphasis or impatience , only a_little loud . 
he had not mention person . 
he had not even think_about her much except once or twice at night in bed when his slowly ranging thought would abruptly , almost accidentally , encounter her . 
at these time he feel a kind of pain in his upper chest , but it be an objective pain , in_no_way different from others in intensity and not different in kind ; it be like the bandaged wound on the back of his head which occasionally throb ; it be merely another part of his weakness . 
he be calm , drugged , and lazy . 
he did not care . 
person mention person . 
she say , `` i notice the girl from across the street has n't bother to phone or visit '' . 
person say , `` that 's all_right . 
person 's all_right '' . 
he think_about it briefly , then deliberately turn the talk to something else . 
once , sit at the front window in his parent ' room , he see person come_out of her house . 
she be with person . 
they be far off and look tiny . 
the heavy branch in his front_yard would hide and then reveal them . 
they turn at the bottom of person 's steps and move off in the direction of the park . 
he think he see - it awaken and , for a moment , interest him - that person hold a leash in her hand and that a round fuzzy puppy be on the end of the leash . 
then they disappear and person get_up and go_into his own room and get_into_bed . 
by the time he be under the cover he had forget about see person . 
the doctor , since person be no_longer allow to make his regular trip into town to see him , come often and informally to the house . 
he would sit , slim-waisted and spare , on the edge of person 's bed , his leg cross so elaborately that the crossed foot could tap the floor . 
person did not mind the doctor 's unsmiling teasing as he used_to . 
`` husky young_man '' , he say with mock distaste . 
`` i imagine you 're always battle in school '' . 
`` i do n't go_to school anymore '' . 
`` pardon '' ? 
the doctor had to bend close to hear ; his delicate hand , as veined as a moth 's wing , rest absently on person 's chest . 
person say the same word more loudly . 
`` oh . 
well , we 're taking a little vacation , that 's all '' . 
he turn unsmilingly to person . 
`` i think by the end of next week he could get_out in the air a_little . 
he could now but the weakness be very definite ; it would exhaust him further and unnecessarily . 
he 'll be strong soon '' . 
his stethoscope be on the table by person 's bed and he pick_up it up and wag it at person . 
he say fussily , `` just keep the cap on those strong emotion '' . 
the stethoscope glint silver in the darken room . 
`` i 'll drop_by again in a_few day '' . 
person stay_on after the doctor had go . 
she smooth the cover on person 's bed and pick_up thing up from the floor . 
she did not touch him . 
person watch with disinterest . 
he did not speak . 
he have no desire to . 
she say , `` do you think you 'll miss school '' ? 
he had notice how formal and irritably exact person had grow . 
he did not care . 
he feel her irritability did not concern him , yet he know he would not care even if it did . 
he shake his head . 
`` we 've had any number of call about you . 
you could win a popularity_contest at that school without any trouble . 
person call twice . 
she want to pay you a visit . 
she say the child miss you . 
apparently you be the light of their life '' . 
person shrug slightly . 
person come close to the bed , bend as if she would kiss him , then move away . 
she was frown . 
`` that doctor annoy me '' . 
she seem to speak_to herself . 
`` do you suppose his self-consciousness be characteristic of the new negro professional or merely of doctor in_general '' ? 
she turn_to him again . 
`` well , person sally - has phone too . 
she be very worried '' . 
person 's tone be dry . 
`` she did n't really say '' - she glance away at the floor , then swoop gracefully and pick_up one of person 's slipper . 
`` i mean , do you feel_like see person '' ? 
person say , `` i do n't know '' . 
it be true . 
he did not . 
there be the slight pain , but it be no different from the throbbing in his head . 
`` well , there 's time , in_any_case . 
we 'll wait till you 're strong and then talk_about it '' . 
she put the slipper neatly by its mate at the foot of the bed . 
person say , `` okay '' . 
this time person kiss him lightly on the forehead . 
person be pleased . 
his father be a constant visitor . 
person would hear the front_door in the evening and then his father 's deep slow voice ; it float up the stairs . 
`` how 's person '' ? 
and person 's or person 's reply : `` better . 
he 's get plenty of rest '' . 
`` be his appetite improved '' ? 
or : `` does he get exercise '' ? 
the exchange be almost invariable , and person , in his bed , could hear every word of_it . 
he never smile . 
it require an energy he no_longer possess to be satirical about his father . 
his father would come upstairs and stand self-consciously at the foot of the bed and look_at his son . 
after a pause , during which he study person 's face as if person be not there and could not study him too , person would ask the same question he had ask downstairs . 
person would reply softly and his father , apologetically , would ask him to repeat . 
`` i'm eating more '' , he would say . 
or : `` i walk_around the house a_lot '' . 
`` perhaps you should get_out a_little '' . 
`` i'm not suppose to yet '' . 
he be not irritate . 
he did not mind the useless , kindly question . 
he look at the lined face with vague interest ; he feel he was note it , as if it be something he might think_about when he grow strong . 
person examine everything with critical care , seek something material to blame for his son 's illness . 
`` have you get enough blanket '' ? 
and another time , without accusation : `` you never wear that scarf i buy you '' . 
where their sharp edge seem restless as sea wave thrust themselves upward in angry motion , person sit glacier like , his smooth solidity , his very immobility defy all the turmoil about him . 
`` our objective '' , the colonel had say that day of the briefing , `` be person '' . 
there the objective sit , brood over all . 
gouge , burn , blast , insult it as they would , could anyone really take person ? 
between the ponderous hulk and himself , in the valley over which person reign , man had hide high_explosive , booby_trap , and mine . 
the raped valley be a pregnant womb await abortion . 
on the forward slope in_front_of his own post stretch two row of barbed_wire . 
at the slope 's base coil of concertina stretch out_of eye range like a wild tangle of child 's hoop , stop simultaneously , weirdly poised as if await the magic of the child 's touch to start them all roll again . 
close still , regular barricade of barbed_wire hang on timber support . 
be it all vain labor ? 
who would clean_up the mess when the war be over ? 
smile at his quixotic thought , person turn_back from the opening and light a cigarette before sit_down . 
tonight a group of man , tomorrow night he himself , would go_out there somewhere and wait . 
if he were to go with person , he would be out there two day , not just listen in the dark at some point between here and person , but move ever deep into enemy land - behind person itself . 
be this what he had expect ? 
he had n't realize that there would be so much time to think , so many lull . 
somehow he had forget what he must have been tell , that combat be an intermittent activity . 
now he know that the moment illuminate by the vision on the train would have_to be approach . 
it could take_place tomorrow night , or it might occur month from now . 
there be just too much time . 
time to become afraid . 
person 's suggestion flatter , but he did not like the identity . 
he did not spill_over with hatred for the enemy . 
he had n't even see him yet . 
press_out his cigarette out in the earth , person walk to the slit and scan the jagged hills . 
he see no life , but still stand there for a time peer at the unlovely hills , his gaze continually return to person . 
he had come here in_order to test himself . 
while most of his belief be still unsettled , he know that he did not believe_in killing . 
yet , he be here . 
he had come because he could not live_out his life feel that he had be a coward . 
there be ten man on the patrol which person lead out that next night . 
the beaming rok was carry a thirty caliber machine_gun ; another man lug the tripod and a box of ammunition . 
person and person each carry , in_addition to their own weapon and ammo , a box of ammo for the rok 's machine_gun . 
others carry extra clip for the browning_automatic_rifle , which be in the hands of a little mexican name person . 
person had brief the two new man that afternoon . 
`` we just sit quiet and wait '' , person had say . 
`` be sure the man near you be awake . 
if person does n't show_up , we 'll all be back here at 0600 hour . 
otherwise , we hold a reception . 
then we pull_out under our mortar and artillery cover , but nobody pull_out until i say so . 
remember what i say about go_out to get anybody leave behind ? 
that still hold . 
we bring_back all dead and wounded '' . 
at 2130 hour they had pass_through the barbed_wire at the point of departure . 
then begin the journey through their own mine_field . 
mine . 
ours be kind than theirs , some say . 
they set bouncing_betty to jump and explode at testicle level while we more mercifully have them go_off at the head . 
mine . 
big ones and little . 
the crude wooden box of the enemy , our nicely turn gray metal disk . 
but theirs defy the detector . 
mine . 
a foot misplaced , a leg missing . 
mine . 
all size : big ones , some wire to set_off a whole field , little ones , hand_grenade size . 
booby_trap to fill the head with chunk of metal . 
person try to shake_off the jumble of his fear by looking_at the sky . 
it be dark . 
person had say that the searchlight would be bounce off the cloud at 2230 hour , `` which give us time to get settle in position '' . 
because they be new man and to be sure that they did n't get lost , person had place person and person in the center of the patrol as it file_out . 
his eye now fixed on person 's solid figure , person could hear behind him the tread of another . 
he could also hear the stream which he had see from his position . 
they were going to follow it for part of their journey . 
`` it 's safe '' , person had say , `` and it provide cover for our noise '' . 
soon they were pick their way along the edge of the stream which glow in the night . 
on their right rise the embankment cover with brush and tree . 
if a branch extend out too far , each man hold it back for the next , and if they meet a low overhang , each warn the other . 
thus , stealthily they advance upstream ; then they turn to the right , climb the embankment , and walk into the valley again . 
there was no cover here , only grass sighing against pant_leg . 
and with each sigh , like a whip in the hand of an expert , the grass strip something from person . 
the gentle whir of each footstep leave him more naked than before , until he feel his unprotected flesh tremble , chill by each new sound . 
the shape of the man ahead of him lack solidity , as if the whip had strip them of their very flesh . 
the dark form move like mourner on some nocturnal pilgrimage , their dirge unsung for want of vocal_cord . 
the warped , broken tree in the valley assume wraithlike shape . 
clump of brush that they pass be so many enchained demon strain in anger to tear and gnaw on his bone . 
loom over all , person leer down at him , threaten a_hundred hidden malevolency . 
off in the distance a searchlight flash on , its beam slash the sky . 
the sharp ray was absorb by a cloud , then reflect to the earth in a soft , diffused radiance . 
somewhere over there another patrol have need of light . 
person think_of all the man out that night who , like himself , had leave their protective ridge and - fear work at their guts - pick their way into the area beyond . 
from the east to the west coast of the location be a strip of land in which fear filled man were at that same moment furtively crawl through the night , sit in sweaty anticipation of any movement or sound , or shout amidst confused rifle flash and muzzle blast . 
person 's arm go_up and person raise his own . 
the patrol was stop . 
person come_up `` take that spot over there '' , he whisper , point to a small clump of blackness . 
`` give me your machine_gun ammo '' . 
person hand him the metal box and person quietly disappear down the line . 
lie in the grass behind the brush clump , person look about . 
the others likewise had hide themselves in the grass and the brush . 
over his shoulder he could see person with the machine_gun crew . 
even at this short distance they be only vague shape , set_up the machine_gun on a small knoll so that it could fire above the head of the rest of the patrol . 
person ease his rifle 's safety off and gently , slowly sneak another clip of ammunition from one of the cloth bandoleer that mark the upper part of his body with an x . 
this he place within quick reach . 
the walk and his fear had serve to overheat him and his sweaty armpit cool at the touch of the night air . 
although the armored vest fit the upper part of his body snugly , he feel no security . 
figure seem to crouch in the surrounding dark ; in the distance he see a band of man who seem to advance and retreat even as he watch . 
certain this menace be only imaginary , he yet stare in fascinated horror , his hand sticky against the stock of his weapon . 
he be aware of insistent inner beating , as if prisoner within seek release from his rigid body . 
above , the glowing ivory baton of their searchlight point at the cloud , dilute the valley 's dark to a pallid light . 
then the figure which hold his attention become a group of shattered tree , stand like the grotesque of a medieval damnation scene . 
even_so , he could not ease the tension of his body ; the rough surface of the earth itself seem to resist every attempt on his part to relax . 
sense the unseen presence of the other man in the patrol , he feel mutely united to these nine near stranger share this pinpoint of being with him . 
he sense something precious in the perilous moment , something akin to the knowledge gain on his bicycle trip through the french countryside , a knowledge imprison in speechlessness . 
in location he had puzzle the meaning of the great stone monument man had throw up to the sky , and always as he wander , he feel a stranger to their exultation . 
they be poem in a strange language , of which he could barely touch a meaning - enough to make his being ache with the desire for the fullness he sense there . 
location , that stone-gray mystery through which he travel for thirty day , sleep in the barn of farmer or alongside road , had work some subtle change in him , he know , and it was in location that he had meet person . 
person have no hand ; they had been sever at the wrist . 
with leather cup fit in his handlebar , he steer his bicycle . 
he and person had travel together for four day . 
they visit the shipyard at location and person had_to sign the register , vouch for the integrity of the visiting foreigner . 
he take the pen in his stump and begin to write . 
`` wait ! 
wait '' ! cry the guard who run from the hut to shout to other man stand about outside . 
they crowd the small room and peer over one another 's shoulder to watch the handless man write his name in the book . 
`` c'est formidable '' , they exclaim . 
`` mais , oui . 
c'est merveilleux '' . 
and_then the question come , eager , interested question , and many compliment on his having overcome his infirmity . 
`` does n't it ever bother you '' , person had ask , `` to have people always ask you about your hand '' ? 
`` oh , the_french be a very curious people '' , person had laugh . 
`` they be also honest seeker after truth . 
now person be painfully silent about my missing hand . 
they refuse to mention or to notice that they be not there . 
the person , like yourself , take the fact for granted , try to be helpful , but do n't ask question . 
i'm used_to all three , but i think the_french have the healthy attitude '' . 
that be the day that person had tell person about the group . 
`` you are look tired and there you can rest . 
it will be good_for_you . 
i think , too '' , he say , his dark eye mischievous , `` that you will find there some clue to the secret of the cathedral about which you have speak '' . 
within two_weeks person was ring the bell at the abbey gate . 
the monk who open the door immediately calm his worry about his reception : `` i speak english '' , the old_man say , `` but i do not hear it very_well '' . 
he smile and stick a large finger with white hair sprout on_it into his ear as though that might help . 
smile at person 's protestation , the old monk take his grip from him and lead him down a corridor to a small parlor . 
`` will you please wait in here . 
person sit over his second whisky_on_the_rocks in a little bar next to the funeral_parlor on location . 
group be small , dark , narrow , and filled with the mingle scent of beer , tobacco smoke , and italian cooking . 
hang over the bar was an oil_painting of a nude person had accept from a student at the group who needed to eat and drink and be broke . 
the nude be small and black-haired and elfin , and be called `` person '' . 
this be one place where person could go for a drink in a back booth without anyone notice him , or at_least come_up and hang_around and want to know all the low-down . 
the other patron be taxidriver and art_student and small shopkeeper . 
the reporter had not_yet discover that this be his hideaway . 
his friend person be with him . 
she be wise enough to realize a man could be good company even if he did weigh too_much and did n't own the mint . 
she be the widow of a writer who had die in an airplane crash , and person had find her a job as head of the historical section of the group . 
this mean sort_out press_clipping and the_like . 
person sit receptive and interested . 
person have a pleasant glow as he say , `` you see , both of them , i mean the president and person , be romantic . 
a romantic be one who think the world is divinely inspire and all he has_to do be find the right key , and then divine justice and altruism will appear . 
it 's like focus a camera ; the distant ship be n't there until you get the focus . 
you know what i'm talk_about . 
i'm sure all girl feel this way about man until they live with them . 
`` but when it come_to war , the colonel know what it be and person does n't . 
person know that a soldier will get the distinguished_service_medal for conduct that would land him in prison for life or the electric_chair as a civilian . 
he have a mean , unbroken sheer bastard in his outfit , and someone invent the name person for him . 
that 's to say , he be trigger-happy . 
he 'd shoot at anything if it be the rear_end of a horse or his own sentry . 
he be a wiry , inscrutable , silent country boy from the red_clay of rural alabama , and he speak with the broad drawl that others normally make_fun of . 
but not in_front_of person . 
i hear of some that try it back in the location , and he 'd knock them clear across the room . 
there 'd be a pretty bad incident back at the marine base . 
a new_york kid , a refugee from one of the harlem gang , make_fun of person 's accent , and draw a knife . 
before the fight be over , the harlem boy have a concussion and person was cut_up badly . 
they catch person steal liquor from the officer ' mess , and he get a_couple_of girl in_trouble . 
the fear of punishment just did n't bother him . 
it be n't there . 
it was leave_out of him at_birth . 
this be why he make such a magnificent soldier . 
he was n't trouble with the ordinary , rank_and_file fear that overcome and paralyze and send individual soldier and whole company under_fire run in panic . 
it just did n't occur to person that anything serious would happen to him . 
do you get_the_picture of the kind of fellow he be '' ? 
person nod with a pleasant smile . 
`` all_right . 
there be a sniper 's nest in a mountain cave , and it was pick_off our man with devilish accuracy . 
the colonel order that it be wipe_out , and i suggest , ' you ask for volunteer , and promise each man on the patrol a quart of whisky , ten dollar and a weekend pass to location ' . 
person be one of the five volunteer . 
the patrol snake around in back of the cave , approach it from above and drop in suddenly with wild howl . 
you could hear them from our outpost . 
there be a_lot of shooting . 
we know the enemy was subdue , because a flare was fire as the signal . 
so we hurry over . 
two of our man were kill , a third was wound . 
person and a very black colored boy from detroit had kill or put out_of action ten guerrilla by grenade and hand-to-hand fighting . 
when we get there , person and the negro were quarrel over possession of a gold crucifix around the neck of a wounded filipino . 
the colored boy have it , and person lunge at him with a knife and say , ' give that to me , you black bastard . 
we do n't ' low nigra to walk on the same sidewalk with white_man where i come from ' . 
`` the negro get a bad slice on his chest from the knife wound '' . 
`` what did the colonel do about the man '' ? 
person ask in her placid , interested way . 
person laugh . 
`` he recommend both of them for the dsm and the detroit fellow for the purple_heart , too , for a combat inflict wound . 
so you see person know what it 's all about . 
but not person . 
when he be in the war , he be in law or supplies or something like that , and an old buddy of his tell me he would come down on sunday to the pentagon and read the citation for medal - just like the one we send_in for person - and go_away with a real glow . 
these be hero nine foot tall to him '' . 
person be alone at the small , perfectly appointed table by the window look_out_over the river . 
he have dinner and sit there over his coffee watch the winding pattern of traffic as it cross the bridge and spread_out like a serpent with two head . 
open beside him be person . 
he think how this dainty , fragile older woman thread her way through the street of location on a day in june , enjoy the flower in the shop , the greeting from old friend , but never really draw a deep , passionate breath , be so like himself . 
he , and person , too , had never permit themselves the luxury of joy that dig_into the bone_marrow of the spirit . 
he had not because he be both poor and ambitious . 
poverty impose a kind of chastity on the ambitious . 
they cannot stop to grasp and embrace and sit in the back seat of car along a dark country lane . 
no , they must look_the_other_way and climb one more painful step up the ladder . 
he make the decision with his eye open , or so he think . 
at any cost , he must leave the dreary pennsylvania mining town where his father be a pharmacist . 
and so he had , so he had . 
at group , he have no time to walk among the violet on the water 's edge . 
from his room he could look out in springtime and see the couple hand_in_hand walk slowly , deliciously , across the campus , and he could smell the sweet vernal wind . 
he be not stone . 
he be not unmoved . 
he had to teach himself patiently that these trap be not for him . 
he must mentally pull the blind and close the window , so that all that exist be in the book before him . 
at law_school , the same . 
more of this stamp_down of human emotion as a young lawyer in new_york . 
by the time he be prosperous enough - his goal be high - he be bald and afraid of woman . 
the only one who would have him be his cripple , the strange unhappy woman who become his wife . 
perhaps it be right ; perhaps it be just . 
he had dared to defy nature , to turn his back to the lorelei , and he was punish . 
like person , with her regret about person , he have his moment of melancholy over a youth too well spend . 
if he had have a son , he would tell him , `` gather ye rosebud while ye may . 
this same flower that smile today tomorrow will be die '' . 
but then his son could afford it . 
person was wait for person . 
the vice_president had call and ask if he could see the secretary at his home . 
he say the matter be urgent . 
the secretary be uneasy about the visit . 
he did not like person . 
he suspect something underhanded and furtive about him . 
person could not put his finger on_it precisely , and this worry him . 
when you dislike or distrust a man , you should have a reason . 
human nature be not a piece of meat you could tell be bad by its smell . 
person stare a minute at the lighted ribbon of traffic , hope that a clue to his dislike of the vice_president would appear . 
it did not . 
therefore , he decide he be unfair to the young_man and should make an effort to understand and sympathize with his point_of_view . 
a half-hour later the vice_president arrive . 
he look_at very carefully at every piece of furnishings , as though hope to store this information carefully in his mind . 
he observe the florentine vase in the hall , the person painting in the library , as_well_as the long shelf of well-bound volume ; the pattern of the oriental rug , the delicate cut_glass chandelier . 
he say to the secretary , `` i understand you come from a little pennsylvania town near location . 
how do you find_out about this '' ? 
he wave his arm around at the furnishings . 
it be not a discourteous question , person decide . 
this young_man have so little time to learn he had to be curious ; he had to find_out . 
the secretary do not tell him at what cost , at what loneliness , he learn these thing . 
he merely say , `` any good decorator these day can make you a tasteful home '' . 
the vice_president say , `` if you hear of any name that would fix_me_cheap in_return_for advertising they decorate the vice_president 's home , let me know . 
i can do business with that kind '' . 
again , person think a_little sadly , these be the fee of poverty and ambition . 
person did not have the chance to grow_up graciously . 
he had to acquire everything he was going_to get in four year . 
they have brandy in the library . 
person look at person with a searching glance , the kind that a prosecuting_attorney would give a man on trial . 
what be your weakness ? 
where will you break ? 
how best to destroy your peace ? 
the vice_president say with a slight bluster , `` there be n't anyone who love the president more_than i do . 
person be my ideal . 
at_the_same_time , you have_to face fact and realize that a man who 's be in the marine_corps all his life does n't understand much about politics . 
what does a monk know about sex '' ? 
person listen with the practiced , deceptive calm of the lawyer , but his face be in the shadow . 
`` so , we have_to protect the old_man for his own good . 
you see what i mean . 
group be full of politician , and if you want to get_along_with them , you have_to be politic . 
this be why i say we just can't go_ahead and disarm the german and pull_down our own defense . 
let me tell you what happen to me today . 
a fellow come_up_to me , a person , i do n't have_to tell you his name , and he tell me , ' i love the president like a brother , but god_damn_it , he 's crucify me . 
i 've have_got a quarter of a_million german in my state , and those krauthead tune_in on person every_night , and if he tell them to go_out and piss in the public_square , that 's what they do . 
he 's tell them now to write letter to their congressman oppose the disarmament of germany ' . 
and another one come to me and he say , ' look_here , there 's a mill in my state employ five thousand people make uniform for the navy . 
the bishop look at him coldly and say `` take it or leave it '' ! 
literally , there be nothing else to do . 
he was catch in a machine . 
but person was not easily excite or upset and say quite calmly : `` let 's go and see what it_'s like '' . 
location be about seventy-five mile west of location , near the location border and on the location , a small and dirty stream . 
the city be a center of manufacture , especially in textile , and also because of the beauty of some of its surroundings , a residence for many owner of the great industry in north location . 
but it have , as be usual in southern city of this sort , a location , a low region near the river where the person live - servant and laborer huddle_together in a region with no sewage save the river , where street and sidewalk be neglected and where there be much poverty and crime . 
person come by train from location and look the city over ; the rather pleasant white city be on the hill where the chief store be . 
beyond be industry and factory . 
then they go_down to location . 
in_the_midst of this crowded region be the group . 
it be an old and dirty wooden structure , sadly in need of repair . 
but it be a landmark . 
it had be there 50 year or more and everybody in town , black and white , know of it . 
it had just suffer a calamity , the final crisis in a long series of calamity . 
for the old preacher who had be there twenty-five year be dead , and the city mourn him . 
he be a loud-voiced man , once vigorous but for many year now decline in strength and ability . 
he be stern and overbearing with his flock , but obsequious and conciliatory with the white , especially the rich who partly support the church . 
the group , head by a black_man name person , had practically take_over as the pastor grow old , and had_its_way with the support of the amen_corner . 
the characteristic thing about this church be its amen_corner and the weekly religious orgy . 
a knot of old worshipper , chiefly woman , listen weekly to a sermon . 
it begin invariably in low tone , almost conversational , and then gradually work_up to high , shrill appeal to god and man . 
and_then the amen_corner take_hold , reenact a form of group_participation in worship that stem from year before the greek_chorus , spread down through the african forest , overseas to the location , and then here in location . 
with shout and slow dance , with tears and song , with scream and contortion , the corner group was beset by hysteria and shiver , wailing , shout , possession of something that seem like an alien and outside force . 
it spread to most of the audience and was often view by visit white who snicker behind handkerchief and afterward discuss negro religion . 
it sometimes end in deathlike trance with many lie exhausted and pant on chair and floor . 
to most of those who compose the amen_corner it be a magnificent and beautiful experience , something for which they live from week to week . 
it was often reenact in less wild form at the wednesday night prayer_meeting . 
person , on his first sunday , witness this with something like disgust . 
he had preach a short sermon , try to talk man-to-man to the audience , to tell them who he be , what he had done in location and birmingham , and what he propose to do here . 
he sympathize_with them on the loss of their old pastor . 
but then , at mention of that name , the amen_corner break_loose . 
he have no chance to say another word . 
at the very end , when the audience be silent and breathless , a collection was take and then slowly everyone file_out . 
the audience did not think much of the new pastor , and what the new pastor think_of the audience he did not dare at the time to say . 
during the next week he look over the situation . 
first_of_all there be the parsonage , an utterly impossible place for civilized people to live_in , originally poorly conceive , apparently not repair for year , with no plumbing or sewage , with rathole and rot . 
it was arrange that he would board in the home of one of the old member of the church , a woman name person who , as person afterward find , was briefly refer to as person because of her sharp_tongue and fierce initiative . 
person be a lonely , devoted soul , never marry , conduct a spotless home and devoted to her church , but a perpetual dissenter and born critic . 
she soar over the new pastor like an avenging angel lest he stray from the path and not know all the truth and gossip of which she be chief repository . 
then person look over the church and study its condition . 
the salary of the pastor had for year be $ 500 annually and even this be in_arrears . 
person make_up_one's_mind that he must receive at_least $ 2500 , but when he mention this to the deacon they say nothing . 
the church itself must be repair . 
it be dirty and neglected . 
it really ought to be rebuilt , and he determine to go_up and talk to the city bank about this . 
meanwhile , the city itself should be talk to . 
the street in the colored section be dirty . 
there be typhoid and malaria . 
the child have nowhere to go and no place to play , not even sidewalk . 
the school be small , dark and ill-equipped . 
the teacher be a pliant fool . 
there be two liquor saloon not very far from the church , one white , that_is conduct for white people with a side_entrance for person ; the other exclusively person . 
undoubtedly , there be a good_deal of gambling in both . 
on the other side of the church be a quiet , well-kept house with shutter and recently paint . 
person inquire about it . 
it be called location . 
the deacon of the church , person , be its janitor . 
one of the leading member of the amen_corner be cook ; there be two or three colored maid employ there . 
person was tell that it be a sort of hotel for white people , which seem to him rather queer . 
why should a white hotel be set_down in the center of location ? 
but nevertheless it look respectable . 
he be glad to have it there . 
the rest of location be a rabbit_warren of home in every condition of neglect , disrepair and careful upkeep . 
dive , carefully repaired hut , and nicely painted and ornamented cottage were jumbled together cheek_by_jowl with little distinction . 
the best could not escape_from the worst and the worst nestle cosily beside the better . 
the yard , front and back , be narrow ; some be trash_dump , some have flower_garden . 
behind be privy , for there be no sewage_system . 
after look about a_bit , person discover beyond location , across the river and far removed from the white city , a considerable tract of land , and it occur to him that the church and the better person home might gradually be move to this plot . 
he talk_about it to the person . 
the person look him over rather carefully . 
he be not sure what kind of a man he have in_hand . 
but there be one thing that he had_to stress , and that be that the contribution to the general church expense , the dollar money , had been seriously fall_behind in this church , and that must be look_after immediately . 
in_fact , he intimate clearly that that be the reason that person had been send here - to make a larger contribution of dollar money . 
person stress the fact that clear as this be , they must have a better church , a more businesslike conduct of the church organization , and an effort to get_out this religious center out_of its rut of wild worship into a modern church organization . 
he emphasize to the person the plan of giving_up the old church and move across the river . 
the person be sure that that would be impossible . 
but he tell person to `` go_ahead and try '' . 
and person try . 
it did seem impossible . 
the bank which hold the mortgage on the old church declare that the interest be considerably in_arrears , and the real_estate people say flatly that the land across the river was being hold for an eventual development for white working people who were come_in , and that none would be sell to colored folk . 
when it was propose to rebuild the church , person find that the terms for a new mortgage be very high . 
he be sure that he could do better if he go_to location to get the deal finance . 
but when this proposal was make to his group , he meet unanimous opposition . 
the church certainly would not be remove . 
the very proposition be sacrilege . 
it had be here fifty year . 
it was going_to stay forever . 
it be hardly possible to get any argument on the subject . 
as for rebuilding , well , that might be look_into , but there be no hurry , no hurry at_all . 
person again go downtown to a different banker , an intelligent young white_man who seem rather sympathetic , but he shake his head . 
`` person '' , he say , `` i think you do n't quite understand the situation here . 
do n't you see the amount_of_money that has been invest by white around that church ? 
tenement , store , saloon , some gambling , i hope not too_much . 
the colored people are get employment at group and other place , and they be near their place of employment . 
when a city has arrange thing like this you cannot easily change them . 
now , if i be you i would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or ten year . 
by that time , perhaps something better can be do '' . 
then person ask , `` what about this group which you mention ? 
i do n't understand why a white hotel should be down here '' . 
the young banker look at him with a certain surprise , and then he say flatly : `` i'm afraid i can't tell you anything in_particular about location . 
you 'll have_to find_out about it on your own . 
hope to see you again '' . 
and he dismiss the colored pastor . 
it was next day that person come and sit beside him and take his hand . 
she say , `` my dear , do you know what location be '' ? 
`` no '' , say person , `` i do n't . 
i was just ask about it . 
what be it '' ? 
`` it_'s a house_of_prostitution for white_man with white girl as inmate . 
they hire a good_deal of local labor , include two member of our group . 
they buy some supplies from our colored grocer and they are patronize by some of the best white gentleman in town '' . 
person stare at her . 
`` my dear , you must be mistaken '' . 
`` talk to person '' , she say . 
and after person had talk to person and to others , he be absolutely amazed . 
this , of_course , be the sort of thing that used_to take_place in southern city - put white house_of_prostitution colored girl in colored neighborhood and carry_on them on openly . 
but it had largely disappear on_account_of protest by the white and through growing resentment on_the_part_of the person as they become more educated and get better wage . 
but this situation of group be more subtle . 
the wage involve be larger and more regular . 
the inmate be white and from out of town , avoid local friction . 
the backing from the white town be great and there be little publicity . 
good wage , patronage and subscription of various kind stop open protest from person . 
and yet person know that this place must go or he must go . 
and for him to leave this job now without accomplish anything would mean practically the end of his career in the methodist_church , if not in all church . 
person dismount in location and hand the rein to location . 
there be a fog , which increase the darkness of the night . 
two gas_lamp be no more than a misleading glow . 
he might have be anywhere or nowhere . 
the pretence be that he was deliver a prescription from person . 
secretary_of_state person be a sick man . 
the idea had come from person , who had once be a chemist 's clerk . 
the sick were always receive medicine . 
no_one would question such an errand . 
the bottle be fill_up with flour . 
before person loom the group , person 's home , where person had once been kill . 
now it would have another death . 
from the outside it be an ordinary enough house of the gentry . 
he clomp heavily up the stoop and ring the bell . 
like the bell at mass , the doorbell was pitched too high . 
it be still good_friday , after_all . 
a nigger boy open the door . 
person do not notice him . 
he was think chiefly of person . 
if their schedule were to synchronize , there be no point in wasting_time . 
he push his way inside . 
for a moment the hall confuse him . 
this be the largest house he had ever be in , almost the largest building , except for a hotel . 
he have no idea where person 's room would be . 
in the half darkness the banister gleam , and the hall seem enormous . 
above him somewhere be the bedroom . 
person would be up there . 
he explain his errand , but without bother much to make it plausible , for he feel something well_up in him which be the reason why he had flee the army . 
he did not really want to kill , but as in the sex_act , there be a moment when the impulse take_over and could not be downed , even while you watch yourself give_way to it . 
he be no_longer worried . 
everything would be all_right . 
he know that in this mood he could not be stop . 
still , the sensation always surprise him . 
it be a thrill he feel no part in . 
he could only watch with a sort of gentle dismay while his body do these quick , appalling , and efficient thing . 
he brush by the idiotic boy and lumber heavily up_the_stairs . 
they be carpeted , but made for pumps and congress_gaiter , not the great clodhopper he wear . 
the sound of his footstep be like a muffled drum . 
at the top of the stairs he run_into somebody stand there angrily in a dressing_gown . 
he stop and whisper his errand . 
person hold_out his hand . 
pant a_little , person shake his head . 
person had tell him to deliver his package in_person . 
person say his father was sleep , and then go through a pantomime at his father 's door , to prove the statement . 
`` very_well '' , person say . 
`` i will go '' . 
he smile , but now that he know where the elder person be , he did not intend to go . 
he pull_out his pistol and fire it . 
it make no sound . 
it had misfire . 
reverse it , he smash the butt down on person 's head , over_and_over_again . 
it was the first blow that be always difficult . 
after that , violence be exultantly easy . 
he get caught_up into it and become a different person . 
only afterwards did an act like that become meaningless , so that he would puzzle_over it for day , whereas at the time it had seem quite real . 
the nigger boy flee down_the_stairs , scream , `` murder '' . 
it be not murder at_all . 
person be more methodical than that . 
he was merely clear a way to what he had_to do . 
he run for the sickroom , find his pistol be broken , and throw_away . 
a knife would do . 
from childhood he had know all about knife . 
someone block the door from inside . 
he smash it in and tumble into darkness . 
he see only dimly moving figure , but when he slash them they yell and flee . 
he go_for the bed , jump_on it , and strike where he could , repeatedly . 
it be like finally get_into one 's own nightmare to punish one 's dream . 
two man pull him off . 
nobody say anything . 
person hack at their arm . 
there be a lady there , in a nightdress . 
he would not have want to hurt a lady . 
another man approach , this one fully dressed . 
when the knife go_into his chest , he go_down at_once . 
`` i'm mad '' , shout person , as he run_out into the hall . 
`` i'm mad '' , and only wish he had be . 
that would have make thing so much easy . 
but he be not mad . 
he was only dream . 
he clatter down_the_stairs and out of the door . 
somewhere in the fog , the nigger boy was still yell murder . 
one always wake_up , even from one 's own dream . 
the clammy air revive him . 
person , he see , had flee . 
well , one did not expect much of people like person . 
he unhitch his horse , walk it away , mount , and spur it on . 
the nigger boy be close behind him . 
then the nigger boy turn_back and he be alone . 
he ride on and on . 
he have no idea where he be . 
after some time he come to an open field . 
an open field be better than a building , that be for_sure , so he dismount , turn off the horse , and plunge through the grass . 
he feel curiously sleepy , the world seem far away ; he know he should get to person , but he did n't know how . 
he be sure , for he had do as he was tell , had n't he ? 
person would find him and take care of him . 
so choose a good tree , he clamber up into it , find a comfortable notch , and curled_up in it to sleep , like the tousled bear he be , with his hand across his chest , as though surfeited with honey . 
violence always make him tired , but he be not frightened . 
in boston , person was wind_up a performance of a_new_way_to_pay_old_debts . 
it be a part so familiar to him that he did not bother to think_about it anymore . 
acting soothe him . 
on a stage he always know what to do , and tonight , to judge by the applause , he must be doing it better than usual . 
as person ( how often had he had_to play that part , who did not believe a word of it ) , he raise his arm and declaim : `` where be my honour now '' ? 
that be one of the high spot of the play . 
the audience , as_usual , love it . 
he be delighted to see them so happy . 
if he have any worry , it be only the small ones , about mother in new_york , and his daughter person and what she might be doing at this hour , with her person , in philadelphia . 
everyone be ambivalent about his profession , if he has practised it long enough , but there be still moment when he love the stage and all those unseen people out there , who might cheer you or boo you , but that be largely , though not entirely , up_to_you . 
they make the world seem friendly somehow , though he know it be not . 
person be quite right about one thing . 
person had be in the greenroom . 
the commotion had bring her into the wing . 
since she could not act , one part suit her as well as any other , and so she be the first person to offer person a glass of water , hold it up to the box , high above her head , to person , who had ask for it . 
she had be one of the first to collect her wit . 
it was not so much that the shot had stun the audience , as that they had been stun already . 
most of them had see our_american_cousin before , and unless person be on stage , there be not much to it . 
the theatre be hot and they were drug with boredom . 
the stage had be empty , except for person , do his star monologue . 
the audience be fond of person , he be a dear , in or out of character , but he be not particularly funny . 
at the end of the monologue the audience would applaud . 
meanwhile it look at the scenery . 
`` well , i guess i know enough to turn you inside_out , you sockdologizing old mantrap '' ! say person , otherwise person . 
there be always a pause here , before the next line . 
that be when the gun go_off . 
yet even that explosion did not mean much . 
gun were go_off all_over location these day , because of the celebration , and the theatre be not soundproof . 
then the audience see a small , dim figure appear at the edge of the presidential box . 
`` sic semper tyrannis '' , it say mildly . 
person had deliver his line . 
behind him billow a small pungent cloud of smoke . 
they strain forward . 
they had not hear what had been say . 
they had been sit too long to be able to stand_up easily . 
the figure leap from the box , almost lose its balance , the flag drape there tear in the air , the figure land on its left leg , fall on its hand , and press itself up . 
person still have his arm raise towards the wing . 
his speech falter . 
he did not lower his arm . 
the figure be so theatrically dressed , that it was as though a character from some other play had blunder into this one . 
the play for saturday night was to be a benefit performance of the_octoroon . 
this figure look_like the slave_dealer from that . 
but it also look_like a toad , hop away from the light . 
there be something maimed and crazy about its motion that disturb them . 
then it disappear into the wing . 
person had not shift position , but he at_last lower his arm . 
person scream . 
there was no mistaking that scream . 
it be what anyone who had ever see her had always expect her to do . 
yet this scream have a different note in it . 
that absence of an urgent self-indulgence dash them awake like a pail of water . 
person , one of the guest in the box , stand_up and demand water . 
her action be involuntary . 
when something unexpected happen , one always ask for water if one be a woman , brandy if one be a man . 
person scream again . 
in the presidential box someone lean over the balustrade and yell : `` he has shoot the person '' ! 
that get_up everybody up . 
on the stage , person begin to weep . 
person brush by him with the glass of water . 
the crowd begin to move . 
in location everyone live in a bubble of plot , and one death might attract another . 
it was not exactly panic they give_way to , but they could not just sit there . 
the beehive voice , for no_one could bear silence , drown_out the sound of person 's weeping . 
at the rear of the auditorium , upstairs , some man try to push open the door to the box corridor . 
it would not give . 
a person clamber up on the stage and get the actor to hoist him up to the box . 
in the audience a man name person lose his head and try to rescue a little girl from the mob , on the same principle which had lead person to demand water . 
someone open the corridor door from the inside , and call_for a doctor . 
somehow person was force through the mob and squeeze_out into the dingy corridor . 
he go straight to the presidential box . 
as_usual , person had lose her head , but nobody blame her for doing so now . 
there be a_little blood on the hem of her dress , for the assassin had slash person 's companion , person , with a knife . 
person say he was bleed to death . 
by the look of him he be n't that far_gone . 
with a sneer , the man spread his leg and , a third time , confront them . 
once_more , katie rear , and whinny in fearfully . 
for a moment , boy and mount hang in midair . 
person twist and , frantically , command the mare to leap straight ahead . 
but the stranger be nimble still . 
with a bold arm , he dared once_more to obstruct them . 
katie rear a third time , then , tremble , descend . 
the stranger leer . 
seize the bridle , he tug with all his might and force katie to her knee . 
it be absurd . 
person could feel himself topple . 
he see the ground come_up - and the stranger 's head . 
with incredible ferocity , he bring_together his fist together and strike . 
the blow encounter silky hair and hard bone . 
the man utter a weird cry , spin about , and collapse in the sand . 
katie scramble to her foot , person agilely retain his seat . 
again katie rear , and now , wickedly , he compel her to bring_down her hoof down again_and_again upon the sprawled figure of the stranger . 
he could feel his own foot , ironshod , strike repeatedly until the body be limp . 
he gloat , and his lip slaver . 
he hear himself chortle . 
they ride around and around to trample the figure into the sand . 
only the top of the head , with a spot bare and white as a clamshell , remain visible . 
person was shout triumphantly . 
a train hoot . 
instantly , he chill . 
they were pursue him . 
he be frightened ; his fist clutch so tightly that his knuckle hurt . 
then katie stumble , and again he was fall , fall ! 
`` person ! 
person '' ! 
his mother was nudge him , but he was still fall . 
his head hang over the board of katie 's stall ; before it was sprawl the mangled corpse of the bearded stranger . 
`` location , wake_up now ! 
we're nearly there '' . 
he had been dream . 
he be safe in his mama 's arm . 
the train had slow . 
house wink as the car roll beside a little depot . 
`` po ' location '' ! the trainman call . 
he come by and repeat , `` po ' location '' ! 
bong ! 
bong ! 
startle him awake . 
the room vibrate as if a giant hand had rock it . 
bong ! 
a dull boom and a throbbing echo . 
the wall bulge , the floor tremble , the windowpane rattle . 
he stare at the far morning , expect a pendulum to swing across the horizon . 
bong ! 
he race to the window and yank at the sash . 
bong ! 
the wood be old , the paint alligatored . 
bong ! 
a fresh breeze salute him . 
six o'clock ! 
he put his his head out . 
there be the slate_roof of the church ; ivy climb the red brick wall like a green scaled monster . 
the clock which had strike present an innocent face . 
in the kitchen mama was wipe the cupboard . 
`` there be a tower and a steeple on the church a_million foot high . 
and the loud clock in the whole world '' ! 
`` i know , person '' , she smile . 
`` they say that our steeple be one_hundred and sixty-two foot high . 
the clock you hear strike - it be really the town clock - was install last april by person , on her birthday '' . 
he dress , and speed outdoors . 
he cross location to location . 
the steeple lean backward , while the church advance like a headless creature in a long , shapeless coat . 
the spire seem to hold_up the sky . 
location , bask in the foothills , be the city_of_god . 
the group , with two steeple and its own school be on location ; the group be one block down location ; the catholic group , with an even tall steeple and a cross on top , stand on location . 
the catholic have the largest cemetery , near the location where location run south ; person whistle when he pass these alien grounds . 
god be everywhere , in the belfry , in the steeple , in the cloud , in the tree , and in the mountain hulk on the horizon . 
somewhere , beyond , where shadow lurk , must be the yawning pit of which papa preach and the dreadful location . 
so , walk in awe , he become familiar_with god , who reside chiefly in group with its high steeple and clock . 
there be no church like group , no preacher like papa , who be intimate with him , and could consign sinner to hellfire . 
to know god he must follow in papa 's footstep . 
he be fortunate , and proud . 
the veteran , idle on their bench in the location , beneath the soldier ' monument , got_to_their_feet when papa approach : `` morning , person '' ! 
his being and his will - person could not divide god from his papa - illumine every parish face , turn the choir into a band of angel , and the pulpit into the tollgate to heaven . 
`` we have nine hundred and eleven member in our charge '' , mama announce , `` and three hundred and eighty sunday_school scholar '' . 
when papa go_out to do god 's work , person often accompany him in the buggy , which was draw by violet , the new black mare . 
although they journey westerly as far as location , beyond the location roundhouse and the machine_shop , and along the location and location , and northward to brooklyn , below location , he could see the church spire wherever he look_back . 
sometimes they go south and roll past the tollhouse - `` afternoon , person '' ! 
- and cross the suspension_bridge to location ; that be pennsylvania . 
in the delaware_river , three long island be overgrown with greening tree and underbrush . 
south of location , and below the junction of the location and the delaware , be the location , from which person could spy new_jersey and pennsylvania , as_well_as new_york , simply by spin around on his heel . 
on these excursion , papa instruct him on man 's chief end , which be his duty to god and his own salvation . 
however , a boy 's lively eye might rove . 
where location purl into the location be a magnificent swimming_hole . 
papa point a scornful finger at the splash youth : `` idle recreation '' ! 
person see no idol ; it trouble him that he could n't always see what papa see . 
he be torn between the excitement in the sun inflamed water and a little engine chug northward on the location . 
`` where you be today '' ? 
person inquire every evening , pretend that he did not care . 
`` he'll make a preacher out of you '' ! 
`` no , he won't '' ! 
person flare . 
`` not me '' ! 
`` somebody 's got_to be a preacher in the family . 
he make a will and last testament before we leave location . 
i hear them ! 
person be the witness '' . 
`` will he die '' ? 
`` everybody does '' . 
person could be hateful . 
to speak of papa die be a sin . 
it could never happen as_long_as god be alert and the group steeple stand_guard with its peaked lance . 
person was constantly slip into the church . 
he pull with all his strength at the heavy , brass bound door , and shuffle along the wainscoted wall . 
the cold , mysterious presence of god be all around him . 
at the end of a shaft_of_light , the pew appear to be broad stairs in a long dungeon . 
far away , stand before a curtained window in the study room , be his father , hand tuck under his coattail , and stare into the dark church . 
the figure was wreathed in an extraordinary luminescence . 
the boy shudder at the deathly pale countenance with its wrinkle and gray hair . 
would papa really die ? 
the mouth be thin lipped and wide , the long cleft in the upper lip like a slide . 
when papa 's slender finger remove the spectacles , there be red indentation on the bridge of the strong nose . 
`` it 's time you begin to think on god , person . 
perhaps one day he will choose you as he choose me , long_ago . 
therefore , give him your affection and store up his love for you . 
open your heart to him and pray , person , pray ! 
for his mercy and his guidance to spare you from evil and eternal punishment in the location '' . 
person had hear these word many time , yet on each occasion they cause him to tremble . 
for he fear the location . 
he strive to think of god and his eternal wrath ; he must pray to be spare . 
person be disappointed that none of the brother had hear the call . 
not person , person , or person , certainly not person . 
person be at location and person at group , where they surely could not hear it . 
someday god would choose him . 
he would hear the call and would run to tell papa . 
the stern face would relax , the black clad arm would embrace him , `` my son '' ! 
yet how might he know the call when it come ? 
probably , as in scripture , a still , small voice would whisper . 
it would summon him once ; if he miss it , never_again . 
what if it come when he was play , or be asleep and dream ? 
he must not fail to hear it . 
he be papa 's chosen ; therefore , nothing but good could happen to him , even in god 's wrathful storm . 
when the sky grow dark and thunder roll across the valley , he be unafraid . 
person might fly into a closet , shut the door and bury her head in the clothes ; he dared to wait for the lightning . 
lightning could strike you blind if you be a sinner ! 
but he be good . 
he clench his fist and face the terror . 
thunder crash ; barrels tumble down the mountainside , and bounce and bounce till their own fury split them open . 
lightning might strike the steeple of the other church ; not of group . 
a flash illumine the tree as a crooked bolt twig in several direction . 
violet whinny from the stable . 
he run out into the downpour , speed across the yard and into the buggy room . 
`` do n't be afraid , violet '' ! 
he shout , and be aghast at the echo . 
`` do n't you be afraid '' ! 
he would save her . 
if there be a fire or a flood he would save mama first and violet next . 
drenched and shake , he stand near the sweet-smelling stall and dared to pat her muzzle . 
`` do n't you be afraid , violet '' ! 
after the storm , the sky clear blue and cool , and fragrant air sweep the hills . 
when the sun come_out , person stride proudly into location , smile like a landlord on industrious tenant . 
the fountain had brim_over , the cannon be wet , the soldier ' monument glisten . 
even before the bench had dry , the civil_war veteran were straggle back to their place . 
the great spire shine as if the lightning had polish it . 
he jump . 
the pointed shadow had nearly touch him . 
he trail person to the baseball_game in the lot on location near the group . 
`` go_on home '' ! 
person screech at him . 
`` someone 'll tell papa '' ! 
no_one tell_on person , not even when he slip live grasshopper into the mite_box . 
person do as he please . 
person take his slingshot and climb to the rooftop to shoot at crow . 
person chew roofer 's tar . 
person have a cigar_box full of marble and shooter , and a roman_candle from last fourth_of_july . 
person hop ride on freight_car , and was chase by person , the railroad guard . 
he come home overheated , run straight to the ice_chest , and gulp shivery cold water . 
person envy him . 
that person ! 
he , too , cock his cap at a jaunty angle , jingle marble in his pocket , and swagger down location . 
on the person ' lawn , little girl in white pinafore were play grownup at a tea_party . 
a newfoundland sit solemnly beside a doghouse half his size . 
person yearn for a dog . 
he wonder whether god have a dog in the sky . 
he meander down location , past the group with its green window_shade . 
he cross the track to group , where lady in gay dress and man in straw boater and waxed mustache crowd the verandah . 
a tall lady , with a ruffled collar very low on her bosom , turn insolent green eye upon him . 
she be tall than person . 
she be so beautiful with her rosy mouth and haughty air that she had to be wicked . 
fiddle screech ; a piano tinkle . 
`` location '' - as person call the town - be crowded with summer people who come to the mountain to escape the heat in the big city . 
they stay_at hotel and boardinghouse , or at private home . 
rich people go_to group , group , group or group . 
if the crummy bastard could write ! 
that 's how it should be . 
it 's those two fucken nigger ! 
krist , i wish they could write ! 
nigger pussy . 
he think_of sweet wet nigger pussy . 
oh , sweet land of heaven , haint there just nothin like sweet nigger pussy ! 
he think_of her , the first one .

she be a juicy one .

he think_of person , the nigger who had go_after his sister . 
he chuckle , the memory vivid .

goddamn nigger , lord .

sonuvabitch , i can n't figure_out what in hell for they go and put nigger in my squad for . 
only one worth a shit , and that 's person . 
he ai n't so bad . 
his thought turn_to other thing . 
the big shock everybody have when they find ol person and those others done_for . 
kaboom for . 
he had be pretty scare himself , wonder what_the_hell was come_off . 
but he soon see which way the ball was bounce . 
soon come_back to his sense . 
`` i soon come_back to my sense '' , he say , aloud , to the young blizzard , proudly , draw_up himself up , as if making a report to some important superior . 
i be the first to get my squad on_the_ball , and anybody thinkin it be easy be pretty damn dumb . 
look_at thum . 
that goddamn redheader be the worst . 
he keep sayin , not me , not me , i do n't wanta wind_up like em . 
but i tell him , goddammit . 
`` i tell him '' , he say aloud . 
`` they 'll get the guy that done it . 
that 'll put the place back to normal . 
normal , by god . 
maybe it 's a good thing it happen . 
maybe they 'll stop it now , once_and_for_all for all . 
clean_up the place up . 
they 're doin it now . 
i hear the whole bunch is croakin out in the snow . 
they 'll get the guy that done it '' . 
there be something trouble him though : as_yet they had n't . 
five day . 
keerist . 
prickly twinge of annoyance run_through him . 
his eye blink hard , snap on and squash some bad thing that were try to push their way into him . 
a tune begin to whirl inside his head . 
one of his favorite : `` guitar_boogie '' . 
it always come_on , faithfully , just like a radio or jukebox , whenever he start to worry too_much about something , when the bad thing try to push their way into him . 
the music drive_off them off , or away , and he be free to walk_on_air in a very few moment , hum and jive within , beat the rhythm within . 
he glow with anticipation about what would happen to the culprit when they catch them . 
turn_over the bastard over to me - to me and my boy - no nigger ever get what would be comin to them - reactionary bastard . 
he had never hear the word reactionary before his life as a pow begin . 
it be a word he be proud_of , a word that mean much to him , and he use it with great pleasure , almost as if it be an exclusive possession , and more : he sense himself to be very highly educated , four_cuts_above any of the folk back home . 
`` four_cuts at_least '' , he chuckle to himself , `` and i owe it all to them '' . 
the word also make him feel hate , sincere hate , for those so label . 
he use it very effectively when he wanted to get his squad on_the_ball . 
it come_up again_and_again in the discussion session . 
lousy reactionary bastard been tryin to fuck_up the program for month . 
month . 
hired , hard lackey of the warmongering capitalist . 
not capture , send here . 
to fuck_up the program . 
you guy remember that . 
remember that . 
he hear himself harangue them . 
he see himself before them deliver the speech .

fuck them * * h he roll_over and try to shut_out the noise , now much loud . 
he snuggle into the blanket * * h person dream . 
he was sit on top of a log which was spin round and around in the water . 
a river , wide as the missouri , where it run_by his place . 
the log was spin . 
but he was not . 
so what ? 
why should i be spin just because the goddamn log is spin ? 
( he ask this out_loud , but no_one hear it over the other noise in the hut ) . 
over on the bank , the west bank , a man stand , call to him . 
he could n't make_out what he was say . 
no_doubt it have to do with the log . 
why should he be concerned ? 
rousseau be so persuasive that voltaire is almost convinced that he should burn his book , too . 
but while the two man are ride into the country , where they are go to dinner , they are attack in the dark of the forest by a band of thief , who strip them of everything , include most of their clothes . 
`` you must be a very learned man '' , say voltaire to one of the bandit . 
`` a learned man '' ? the bandit laugh in his face . 
but voltaire persevere . 
he go_to the chief himself . 
`` at what university do you study '' ? he ask . 
he refuse to believe that the bandit chief never attend a higher institution . 
`` to have become so corrupt '' , he say , `` surely you must have study many arts and science '' . 
the chief , annoy by these question , knock_down voltaire down and shout at him that he not_only never go_to any school , but never even learn how to read . 
when finally the two bedraggled man reach their friend 's home , voltaire 's fear are once_again arouse . 
for it be such a distinguished place , with such fine work_of_art and such a big library , that there can be little doubt but that the owner has become deprave by all this culture . 
to voltaire 's surprise , however , their host give them fresh clothes to put_on , open his purse to lend them money and sit_down them down before a good dinner . 
immediately after dinner , however , rousseau ask for still another favor . 
could he have pen and paper , please ? 
he be in a hurry to write another essay against culture . 
such be the impromptu that voltaire give to howl of laughter at location and that was soon circulate in manuscript throughout the literary circle of europe , to be print sometime later , but with the name of person , the famous misanthrope , substitute for that of rousseau . 
how cruel ! 
but at_the_same_time how understandable . 
how could the rich , for whom life was make so simple , ever understand the subterfuge , the lie , the fraud , the error , sin and even crime to which the poor were drive in their effort to overcome the great advantage the rich have in the race of life ? 
how , for_example , could a voltaire understand the strange predicament in which a rousseau would find himself when , soon after the furor of his first discourse , he acquire still another title to fame ? 
this time as a musician . 
as a composer . 
ever since he had first begin to study music and to teach it , rousseau had dream of pierce through to fame as the result of a successful opera . 
but his facility in this genre be not great . 
and his effort to get a performance for his gallant_muses invariably fail . 
and for good reason . 
his operatic music have little merit . 
but then one day , while on a week 's visit to the country home of a retired swiss jeweler , rousseau amuse the company with a_few little melody he had write , to which he attach no great importance . 
he be really amazed to discover the other guest so excite about these delicate little song . 
`` put a_few such song together '' , they urge him . 
`` string them onto some sort of little plot , and you 'll have a delightful operetta '' . 
he did n't believe them . 
`` nonsense '' , he say . 
`` this be the sort of stuff i write and then throw_away '' ! 
`` heaven_forbid '' ! cry the lady , enchant by his music . 
`` you must make an opera out of this material '' . 
and they would n't leave_off argue and plead until he had promise . 
oh , the irony and the bitterness of_it ! 
that after all his year of effort to become a composer , he should now , now when he was still stoutly reply to the critic of his discourse_on_the_arts_and_sciences , be so close to a success in music and have_to reject it . 
or at_least appear to reject it ! 
but what else could he do ? 
you could n't on_the_one_hand decry the art and at_the_same_time practice them , could you ? 
well , yes , perhaps in literature , since you could argue that you could n't keep silent about your feeling against literature and so were involved in spite of yourself . 
but now music too ? 
no . 
that would be too_much ! 
and the fault , of_course , be person 's . 
the fault be person 's and that of the whole culture of this parisian age . 
for it was person 's type of music that he had been try to write , and that he could n't write . 
these little song , however , be sweet_nothings from_the_heart , tender memory of his childhood , little melody that anyone could hum and that would make one want to weep . 
but no . 
he could n't appear as a composer now . 
that glory , crave for so long , was now forbid to him . 
still , just for the lady , and just for this once , for this one weekend in the country , he would make a little piece out of his melody . 
the lady be delight and person was applaud . 
and everyone went to work to learn the part which he write . 
but then , after the little operetta had been give its feeble amateur rendering , everyone insist that it be too good to be lost forever , and that the group must now have the manuscript in_order to give it the really first-rate performance it merit . 
person be aware that he must seem like a hypocrite , stand there and argue that he could not possibly permit a public performance . 
the lady especially could n't understand what trouble him . 
a contradiction ? 
bah , what be a contradiction in one 's life ? 
every woman has have the experience of say no when she mean yes , and say yes when she mean no . 
person had_to admit that though he could n't agree to a public performance , he would indeed , just for his own private satisfaction , dearly love to know how his work would sound when do by professional musician and by trained voice . 
`` i 'd simply like to know if it be as_good_as you kind people seem to think '' , he say . 
person , the historian , point_out to person that this be impossible . 
the musician of the group would not rehearse a work merely to see how it would sound . 
merely to satisfy the author 's curiosity . 
rousseau agree . 
but he recall that person had once have a private performance of his opera armide , behind closed door , just for himself alone . 
person understand what was bother rousseau : that the writer of the prosopopoeia_of_fabricius should now become known as the writer of an amusing little operetta . 
that would certainly be paradoxical . 
but person think he see a way_out . 
`` let me do the submit to the group '' , he suggest . 
`` your name will never appear . 
no_one will even suspect that it be your work '' . 
to_that rousseau could agree . 
but now what crazy twist and turn of his emotion ! 
afraid at one_and_the_same time that his work might be turn_down - which would be a blow to his pride even_though no_one know he be the author - and that the work would be accept , and then that his violent feeling in the matter would certainly betray how deeply concern he be in_spite_of himself . 
and how anxious this lover of obscurity be for applause ! 
and thus torn between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera and the necessity of remain true to his proclaimed desire for anonymity , rousseau suffer through several painful week . 
all these emotion were screw_up to new height when , after acceptance and the first rehearsal , there ensue such a buzz of excitement among parisian music_lover that person had_to come run to rousseau to inform him that the news had reach the superintendent of the king 's amusement , and that he was now demand that the work be offer first at the royal summer palace of location . 
imagine the honor of_it ! 
`` what be your answer '' ? 
person ask , strive to appear unimpressed . 
`` i refuse '' , person say . 
`` what else could i do ? 
person be incensed , of_course . 
but i say i would first have_to get the author 's permission . 
and i be certain he would refuse '' . 
how infuriating all this be ! 
why had not this success come to him before he had plunge into his discourse , and before he had commit himself to a life of austerity and denial ? 
now , when everything was open_up to him - even the court of person 15 , ! 
- he had_to play a role of self-effacement . 
back_and_forth person had_to go , between person and person and between the person and person again , as his little operetta , the_village_soothsayer , though still unperformed , take_on ever more importance . 
and of_course the news of who the composer be did finally begin to get_around among his close friend . 
but they , naturally , keep his secret well , and the public at_large know only of a great excitement in musical and court circle . 
how titillating it be to go among people who did not know him as the composer , but who talk in the most glowing term of the promise of the piece after having hear the first rehearsal . 
the furor be such_that people who could not possibly have squirm their way into the rehearsal were pretend that they be intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational . 
and listen to such a conversation one morning while take a cup of chocolate in a cafe , person find himself bathe in perspiration , tremble lest his authorship become known , and at_the_same_time dream of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer . 
he feel himself now , as he himself say in his confessions , at a crucial point of his life . 
and that be why , on the day of the performance , when a carriage from the royal stable call to take him to the palace , he did not bother to shave . 
on_the_contrary , he be pleased that his face show a neglect of several day . 
see him in that condition , and about to enter the hall where the person , the queen , the whole royal_family and all the member of the high aristocracy would be present , person and the person and_others try to stop him . 
`` you can n't go_in that way '' ! they cry . 
`` why not '' ? 
person ask . 
`` who is go_to stop me '' ? 
`` you have n't dress for the occasion '' ! they point_out to him . 
`` i'm dress as i always am '' , person say . 
`` neither good nor worse '' . 
`` at home , yes '' , they argue . 
`` but here you be in the palace . 
there 's the king . 
and person '' . 
`` if they be here , then surely i have the right to be here '' , person say . 
`` and even more right . 
since i be the composer '' ! 
`` but in such a slovenly condition '' . 
`` what be slovenly about me '' ? 
person ask . 
`` is it because of my slovenliness that hair grow on my face ? 
surely it would grow there whether i wash myself or not . 
a_hundred year ago i would have wear a beard with_pride . 
and those without beard would have stand_out as not dress for the occasion . 
now times have change , and i must pretend that hair does n't grow on my face . 
that 's the fashion . 
and fashion be the real king here . 
not person , , since even he obey . 
now , if you do n't mind , i should_like to hear my own piece perform '' . 
but of_course behind his boldness he did n't feel bold at_all . 
he tremble lest his piece should fail . 
and this in_addition to his usual fear of be among people of high_society . 
his fear of make some inane or inappropriate remark . 
and even deep than that : 
his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly itch to relieve_oneself . 
could he walk out in_the_midst of his piece ? 
here , before the court ? 
before the king ? 
it be the first time any of us had laugh since the morning begin . 
the rider from concord be as_good_as his word . 
he come spur and whoop down the road , his horse kick_up cloud of dust , shout : 
`` they 're a-coming ! 
by god , they 're a-coming , they are '' ! 
we hear him before he ever show , and we hear him yell after he be out_of_sight . 
person had n't misjudge the strength of his lung , not at all . 
i think you could have hear him a mile away , and he was burst at every seam with importance . 
i have observe that be up on a horse change the whole character of a man , and when a very small man be up on a saddle , he 'd like as not prefer to eat his meal there . 
that 's understandable , and i appreciate the sentiment . 
as for this rider , i never see him before or afterwards and never see him dismounted , so whether he stand tall or short in his shoe , i can n't say ; but i do know that he give the day tone and distinction . 
the last thing in_the_world that resemble a war be our line of farmer and storekeeper and mechanic perch on top of a stone_wall , and this dashing rider make us feel a good_deal sharp and more alert to the situation . 
we come_down off the wall as if he had topple all_of us , and we crouch behind it . 
i have hear people talk with contempt about the british regular , but that only prove that a_lot of people talk_about thing of which they be deplorably ignorant . 
whatever we feel about the redcoat , we respect them in_terms_of their trade , which be killing ; and i know that i , myself , be nauseated with apprehension and fear and that my hand be soaking wet where they hold my gun . 
i wanted to wipe my flint , but i did n't dare to , the state my hand be in , just as i did n't dare to do anything about the priming . 
the gun would fire or not , just as chance will . 
i put a_lot more trust in my two leg than in the gun , because the most important thing i had learn about war be that you could run_away and survive to talk_about it . 
the gunfire , which be so near that it seem just a piece up the road now , stop for long enough to count to twenty ; and in that brief interval , a redcoat officer come tear down the road , whip his horse fit to kill . 
i do n't know whether he be_after our rider , who had go_by a minute before , or whether he was simply scout condition ; but when he pass_by us by , a musket roar , and he rear his horse , swing it around , and begin to whip it back in the direction from which he had come . 
he be a fine and showy rider , but his skill was wasted on us . 
from above me and somewhere behind me , a rifle crack . 
the redcoat officer collapse like a punctured bolster , and the horse rear and throw him from the saddle , except that one booted foot catch in the stirrup . 
half crazed by the weight drag , the dust , and the heat , the horse leap our wall , dash out the rider 's brain against it , and leave him lie there among us - while the horse crash away through the brush . 
it be my initiation to war and the insane symphony war play ; for what had happen on the common be only terror and flight ; but this grinning , broken head , not ten foot away from me , be the sharp definition of what my reality had become . 
and now the redcoat were come , and the gunfire be a part of the dust_cloud on the road to the west of us . 
i must state that the fast thing happen , the slow they happen ; the passage and rhythm of time change , and when i remember back to what happen then , each event be a separate and frozen incident . 
in my recollection , there be a long interval between the death of the officer and the appearance of the first of the retreating redcoat , and in that interval the dust_cloud over the road seem to hover indefinitely . 
yet it could not have be more than a matter of second , and then the front of the british army come into view . 
it was only hour since i had last see them , but they had change and i had change . 
in the very front rank , two man be wounded and stagger along , trail blood behind them . 
no drummer here , no piper , and the redcoat be covered with a fine film of dust . 
they march with bayonet fixed , and as fixed on their face be anger , fear , and torment . 
rank after rank of them come_down the road , and the face be all the same , and they walk in a sea of dust . 
`` committeeman , hold your fire ! 
hold your fire '' ! 
a voice call , and what make it even more terrible and unreal be that the redcoat rank never pause for an instant , only some of them glance toward the stone_wall , from behind which the voice come . 
the front of their column had already pass us , when another officer come ride down the side of the road , not five pace from where we be . 
my person carry a musket , but he had load it with bird_shot , and as the officer come opposite him , he rise_up behind the wall and fire . 
one moment there be a man in the saddle ; the next a headless horror on a horse that bolt through the redcoat rank , and during the next second or two , we all_of us fire into the suddenly disorganized column of soldier . 
one moment , the road be filled with disciplined troops , march four by four with a purpose as implacable as death ; the next , a cloud of gun_smoke cover a screaming fury of sound , out of which the redcoat soldier emerge with their bayonet and their cursing fury . 
in the course of_this , they had fire on us ; but i have no memory of_that . 
i had squeeze the trigger of my own gun , and to my amazement , it had fire and kick_back into my shoulder with the force of an angry mule ; and then i was add my own voice to the crescendo of sound , hurl more vile language than i ever think i know , sob and shout , and aware that if i had pass_water before , it be not enough , for my pants be soaking wet . 
i would have stand there and die there if leave to myself , but person grab my arm in his viselike grip and fairly pluck me out of there ; and_then i come_to some sanity and plunge away with such extraordinary speed that i outdistance person by_far . 
everyone else was run . 
later we realize that the redcoat had stop their charge at the wall . 
their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep march . 
we tumble to a stop in person 's cow hole , a low-lying bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its middle . 
a dozen cow moo sadly and regard us as if we be insane , as perhaps we be at that moment , with the crazy excitement of our first encounter , the yelling and shooting still continue up at the road , and the thirst of some of the man , which be so great that they wade into the muddy water and scoop_up handful of_it . 
person , one of the man from location , had take a musket_ball in his belly ; and though he had find the strength to run with us , now he collapse and lie on the ground , die , the reverend hold his head and wipe his hot brow . 
it may appear that we be cruel and callous , but no_one have time to spend sympathize_with poor person - except the person . 
i know that i myself feel that it be a mortal shame for a man to be tear open by a british musket_ball , as person had been , yet i also feel relieved and lucky that it had be him and not myself . 
i be drunk with excitement and the smell of gunpowder that come float down from the road , and the fact that i be not afraid now , but only wait to know what to do next . 
meanwhile , i reload my gun , as the other man were doing . 
we be less than a quarter of a mile from the road , and we could trace its shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and dust that hang over it . 
wherever you look , you see committeeman run across the meadow , some away from the road , some toward it , some parallel to it ; and about a mile to the west a cluster of at_least fifty militia were make_one's_way their way in our direction . 
person and some others feel that we should march toward location and take_up new position ahead of the slow-moving british column , but another group maintain that we should stick to this spot and this section of road . 
i did n't offer any advice , but i certainly did not want to go_back to where the officer lie with his brain dash out . 
someone say that while we were stand here and argue about it , the_british would be go ; but person say he had watch them march west early in the morning , and move at a much brisk pace it had still take half an hour for their column to pass , what with the narrowness of the road and their baggage and ammunition cart . 
while this was being discuss , we see the militia to the west of us fan_out and break into little cluster of two and three man as they approach the road . 
it was the opinion of some of us that these must be part of the committeeman who had be in the battle_of_the_north_bridge , which entitle them to a sort of veteran status , and we feel that if they employ this tactic , it be likely enough the best one . 
person say : 
`` it make_sense . 
if we cluster together , the redcoat can make an advantage out of_it , but there 's not a blessed thing they can do with two or three of us except chase us , and we can outrun them '' . 
that settle it , and we break into party of two and three . 
person decide to remain with the person and poor person until life pass_away - and he be hurt so badly he did not seem for long in this world . 
i go_off with person , who maintain that if he did n't see to me , he did n't know who would . 
`` good_heavens , person '' , he say , `` i think one thing you 'd have no trouble learning be when to get_out of a place '' . 
`` i learn that now '' , i say . 
we run east for about half a mile before we turn_back to the road , pant from the effort and soaked with sweat . 
there be a clump of tree that appear to provide cover right up_to the road , and the shouting and gunfire never slacken . 
under the tree , there be a dead redcoat , a young boy with a pasty white skin and a face full of pimple , who had take a rifle_ball directly between the eye . 
three man be around him . 
they had strip him of his musket and equipment , and now they were pull_off his boot and jacket off . 
person grab one of them by the shoulder and fling him away . 
`` god's_name , what be you to rob the dead with the fight go_on '' ! 
person roar . 
they try to outface him , but person be as wide as two average man , and it would have take brave man than these be to outface him . 
that summer the gambling_house were close , despite the threat of person , a gaming_card manufacturer . 
dancing was no_longer permit in the street . 
the group and other place of prostitution were empty . 
the slit breeches had_to go . 
drunkenness was no_longer tolerate . 
in defiance , a chinless reprobate , person , march down the aisle in group 's one sunday morning , follow by one of the woman from the group , whose dress and walk plainly show the lack of any shame . 
plunk themselves down on the front bench , they turn to smirk at those around them . 
person 's first impulse be to denounce their blasphemy . 
but the thought occur that god would want this opportunity used to tell them about him . 
calmly he open the bible and read of the woman at the well . 
he finish the worship service as if there had be no brazen attempt to dishonor god and man . 
the next morning , as the clock strike nine , he appear at the council meeting in the location and insist that the couple would have_to be punish if the church was to be respect . 
`` i have tell you before , and i tell you again '' , person say rudely . 
`` stick_to the preaching of the gospel '' ! 
person stiffen in anger . 
`` that is the answer the ungodly will always make when the church point its finger at their sin . 
i say to you that the church will ever decry evil '' ! 
person 's reply be like a declaration of war . 
person sit_down in his high-backed stall , lip compressed , eye glinting . 
person , a short man with a rotunda of stomach , rise . 
every eye be on him as he begin to speak . 
`` what person say be true . 
how can we have a good city unless we respect morality '' ? 
person , a tall man with sunken cheek and deep-set eye , got_to_his_feet . 
`` we all know that person and the woman are brazenly live together . 
it would be well to show the populace how we deal with adulterer '' . 
person , the son of the famous patriot , disagree . 
`` do not listen to that frenchman . 
he is throttle the liberty my father give his life to win '' ! 
person be quietly insistent . 
`` there can be no compromise when soul be in jeopardy '' . 
a week later the sentence of the council was carry_out : person and the woman were march naked through the street past a mocking populace . 
before them stalk the beadle , proclaim as he go , `` thus the council deal with those who break its law - adulterer , thief , murderer , and lewd person . 
let evildoer contemplate their way , and let every man beware '' ! 
person 's thought race painfully into the past as he read the letter he had just receive from his sister person . 
person had die two_weeks before , in early november , without being reconcile to the church . 
the canon , in a body , had try to force him on his deathbed to let them give him the last_rites of the church , but he had die still proclaim salvation by faith . 
burial had take_place at night in the ground at the public crossroads under the gibbet , so that his enemy could not find his body and have it dig_up and burn . 
the abbot of group , person , had be a good friend , but not even he think person deserve burial in hallowed ground . 
person close his eye and see once_again the little niche in his mother 's bedroom , where she had kneel to tell the good person of her need . 
the blue draped person be still there , but no_one kneel before her now . 
not even person ; she , too , pray only to god . 
for an instant person long for the sound of the bell of location , the touch of his mother 's hand , the lilt of person 's voice in the square raftered room , his father 's bass tone rumble to the canon , and the sight of the beloved bishop . 
but he had_to follow the light . 
unless god expect a man to believe the holy_scripture , why had he give them to him ? 
the white clad tree stand like specter in the february night . 
snow bury the street and cover the slanting rooftop , as person trudge toward group 's . 
a carriage crunch by , its dim light filter through the gloom . 
the sharp wind slap at him and his foot feel like ice as the snow penetrate the hole of his shoe , his only ones , now patched with folded parchment . 
the city had recently give him a small salary , but it be not enough to supply even necessity . 
as he near the square , a round figure muffled in a long , black cape whisk_by . 
person recognize person and call_out a greeting . 
how grateful he be to such man ! 
there be several on the council who try to live like christian . 
despite their effort , the problem seem to grow grave all_the_time . 
quicken his step , person enter the vast church and climb the tower steps to the bell . 
underneath the big one , in the silent moonlight , lie a dead pigeon , and on the smaller bell , the clemence , two gray and white bird sleep huddle_together in the cold winter air . 
person lean upon the stone balustrade . 
he brush back his black hair , shove it under his pastor 's cap to keep it from blow in his eye . 
below the moon-splashed world roll away to insurmountable white peak ; above him the deep blue sky glitter with star . 
he stand_still very still , his arm at his side , stare up at the heavens , then down at the blinking light below . 
`` how long , my lord ? 
how long ? 
i have never ask for an easy task , but i be weary of the strife '' . 
sleep be difficult these day . 
indigestion plague him . 
severe headache be frequent . 
loneliness tear through him like a physical pain whenever he think_of person , person , person , person , and even the compromising person . 
an occasional traveler from italy bring news of person , who was now distribute his bible among the location peasant . 
letter come regularly from person , person , and person . 
he have person and person to confide in and consult . 
but person continue to find a bitter joy in smash image and tear_down symbol sacred to the group . 
person find it difficult , but he hold him in check . 
and person be busy most of the time court this girl and that . 
his easy good_looks make him a favorite with the lady . 
location , instead of become the city_of_god , as person had dream , had in the two year since he had be there , continue to be a godless place where all manner of vice flourish . 
refugee pour in , sign the confession and rule in_order to remain , and then disregard them . 
dice roll , prostitute ply their trade , thief steal , murderer stab , and the ungodly blaspheme . 
catholic who be truly christian long for the simple penance of day go_by . 
libertine recall the heroism of the past and demand : `` are we go_to allow the protestant_pope , person , to curtail our liberty ? 
why , oh why , does n't he stick_to preaching the gospel , instead of meddling in civic affair , politics , economics , and social issue that be no concern of the church '' ? 
and person 's reply be always the same : `` anything that affect soul be the concern of the church ! 
we will have righteousness '' ! 
tears burn behind his eye as he pray and meditate tonight . 
unless the confusion clear , he would not be come here much longer . 
person 's threat would become a reality , for he continue to proclaim loudly that the city must rid itself of `` that frenchman '' . 
the slow tapping of a cane on the stone steps come up to the tower interrupt his reverie . 
faint at_first , the tapping grow until it sound loud against the wind . 
person ! 
person think . 
what is he do here at this hour ? 
he start down the steps to meet the near-blind preacher , who had be one of the early gospeler in location . 
`` person ? 
be that you ? 
i come to warn you of a plot '' ! 
person stand above him , his face ashen . 
what now ? 
slowly , like a man grow old , he take person 's hand and lead him below to the tower study , guide him to a chair beside the little hearth where a fire still burn . 
`` plot '' ? 
person ask tiredly . 
`` person just paid me a visit . 
i go_to your room , and person tell me you be here . 
two anabaptist , person and person , are to challenge you and person to a debate before the council . 
it is to be a trap . 
you know the law : if you lose the debate after accept a challenge , you will be banish '' ! 
`` what will be the subject '' ? 
`` you are to be accuse of arianism to confuse the religious who remain loyal '' . 
anger and fear fuse in person . 
ever since the fourth century a controversy had rage over the person of christ . 
those who refuse to believe that he be the eternal son of god were term arianist . 
person had come to location , say that he had be a bishop of the church_of_rome and had been persecute in paris for his reformed faith . 
he ask to be appoint a preacher . 
but person had unmask him , reveal he had never be a bishop , but be an anabaptist , afraid to state his faith , because he know person had write a book against their belief that the soul sleep after death . 
so person had refuse to agree to his appointment as a preacher , and now person seek revenge . 
person sigh . 
`` if person agree , we should insist on a public_debate '' , he say at_length . 
`` there be more to the conspiracy . 
person demand that the lord's_supper be administer here as it used_to be , with unleavened_bread . 
furthermore , bern decree that we must do as we are order by the council , preach only the word_of_god and stop meddling in politics '' ! 
`` it was always the spirit with christ ; matter such_as leavened or unleavened_bread be inconsequential . 
location must remain a sovereign state . 
we will not yield to the demand of bern '' ! 
the firelight play over person 's flowing white lock and rugged feature . 
`` person indicate that if i would cooperate , after you and person are banish , following the debate , i will be give a place of influence '' . 
`` what be your reply to that '' ? 
`` that i would rather be banish with two such christian than be make the person '' ! 
the following morning , as person enter the location on his way to visit a sick refugee , he have a premonition of danger . 
then suddenly a group of man and dog circle him . 
he wanted to run , but he know that if he did , he would be lost . 
he stand very still , his heart thump wildly . 
on the outskirts of the rabble the person brother and person shake their fist . 
`` are you go_to comply with the demand of bern '' ? 
the chinless person call . 
`` arianist '' ! a rowdy with a big blob of a nose roar . 
`` heretic '' ! 
person lift his hand for silence . 
`` know this : the minister will not yield to the demand of bern '' . 
his voice shake a_little . 
somebody heave a stone . 
for an instant person be stun . 
when he feel the side of his head , his finger come_away cover with blood . 
before he could duck , another stone strike him . 
and another . 
`` let him be now '' ! 
person , the gaming_card manufacturer say , his little pig eye glaring . 
`` we have teach him a lesson '' . 
the crowd move_back and person start dizzily down the hill . 
fist pummel him as he stagger forward . 
then he slip and go_down on his hand and knee in the melting snow . 
at_once a bevy of dog was snap and snarl around him . 
one , more horrible than the rest , lunge , growl deep in his throat , his hair bristle . 
with great difficulty person clamber to his foot and start to run , sweat pour down his face . 
stand in the shelter of the tent - a rejected hospital tent on which the rain now drip , no_longer drum - person watch his own hand touch the object on the improvised counter of board lay across two beef barrel . 
there be , of_course , no real need to rearrange everything . 
a quarter inch this way or that for the hardbake , or the toffee , or the barley sugar , or the sardine , or the bitters , or the condensed_milk , or the stationery , or the needle - what could it mean ? 
person watch his own hand make the caress , anxious movement that , when rain fall and nobody come , and ruin draw_close like a cat rub against the ankle , has be the ritual of stall vendor , forever . 
he recognize the gesture . 
he know its meaning . 
he had see a dry , old , yellow hand reach_out , with that painful solicitude , to touch , to rearrange , to shift aimlessly , some object worth a pfennig . 
back in bavaria he had see that gesture , and at that sight his heart had always die within him . 
on such occasion he had not have the courage to look at the face above the hand , whatever face it might be . 
now the face be his own . 
he wonder what expression , as he make that gesture , be on his face . 
he wonder if it wear the old anxiety , or the old , taut stoicism . 
but there be no need , he remember , for his hand to reach_out , for his face to show concern or stoicism . 
it was nothing to him if rain fall and nobody come . 
then why was he assume the role - the gesture and the suffering ? 
what was he expiate ? 
or was he now take the role - the gesture and the suffering - because it be the only way to affirm his history and identity in the torpid , befog loneliness of this land . 
this be virginia . 
he look_out of the tent at the company street . 
the rain drip on the freezing loblolly of the street . 
beyond that misty gray of the rain , he see the stretching hutment , low diminutive log_cabin , chinked with mud , with doorway a man would have_to crouch to get through , with roof of tenting lay_over bough or board from hardtack box , or fence_rail , with cranky chimney of stick and dry mud . 
the chimney of the hut across from him was surmount by a beef barrel with end knock_out . 
in this heavy air , however , that device did not seem to help . 
the smoke from that chimney rise as sluggishly as smoke from any other , and hang as sadly in the drizzle , creep back_down along the sopping canvas of the roof . 
over the door be a board with large , inept lettering : 
home_sweet_home . 
this be the hut of person , the hero . 
the man were huddle in those lair . 
person know the name of some . 
he know the face of all , hairy or shaven , old or young , fat or thin , suffering or hardened , sad or gay , good or bad . 
when they stand about his tent , chaff each other , exchange their obscenity , curse command or weather , he had study their face . 
he had have the need to understand what life lurk behind the mask of flesh , behind the oath , the banter , the sadness . 
once covertly look at person , the only man in the world whom he hate , he had see the heavy , slack , bestubbled jaw open and close to emit the cruel , obscene banter , and had see the pale blue eye go watery with whisky and merriment , and suddenly he was not see the face of that vile creature . 
he was see , somehow , the face of a young boy , the boy person must once have be , a boy with sorrel hair , and blue eye dance with gaiety , and the boy mouth grinning trustfully among the freckle . 
in that moment of vision person hear the voice within himself say : i must not hate him , i must not hate him or i shall die . 
his heart suddenly open to joy . 
he think that if once , only once , he could talk with person , something about his own life , and all life , would be clear and simple . 
if person would turn_to him and say : `` person , you know when i be a boy , it was a funny thing happen . 
lemme tell you now '' - 
if only person could do that , whatever the thing he remember and tell . 
it would be a sign for the untellable , and he , person , would understand . 
now , person , in the gray light of afternoon , stare across at the hut opposite his tent , and think_of person lie in there in the gloom , snore on his bunk , with the fumes of whisky choke the air . 
he see the sign above the door of the hut : home_sweet_home . 
he see the figure of a man in a poncho come up the company street , with an armful of wood . 
it be person , the campmate of person . 
he carry the wood , carry the water , do the cooking , cleaning and mend , and occasionally get a kick_in_the_butt for his pains . 
person watch the moisture flow from the poncho . 
it give the rubberized fabric a dull gleam , like metal . 
person humbly lower his head , push_aside the hardtack box door of the hut , and be go from sight . 
person stare at the door and remember that person had been award the medal_of_honor for gallantry at location . 
the street be again empty . 
the drizzle was slack_off now , but the light be gray . 
with enormous interest , person watch his hand as they touch and shift the object on the board directly before him . 
into the emptiness of the street , and his spirit , move a form . 
the form was swathe in an army blanket , much patch , fasten at the neck with a cord . 
from under the shapeless huddle of blanket the foot move in the mud . 
the foot wear army shoe , in obvious disrepair . 
the head was wrap in a turban and on top of the turban ride a great hamper across which a piece of poncho had been fling . 
the gray face stare straight ahead in the drizzle . 
moisture run_down the cheek , gather at the tip of the nose , and at the chin . 
the figure be close enough now for him to see the nose twitch to dislodge the drop cling there . 
the figure stop and one hand was perilously free from the hamper to scratch the nose . 
then the figure move_on . 
this be one of the irish woman who had build their own hut down near the river . 
they do wash . 
person recognize this one . 
he recognize her because she be the one who , in a winter twilight , on the edge of camp , had once stop him and reach down her hand to touch his fly . 
`` slice o_' mutton , bhoy '' ? she had query in her soft guttural . 
`` slice o_' mutton '' ? 
her name be person . 
they call her person , and laugh . 
look down the street after her , person see that she had again stop and again remove one hand from the basket . 
he could not make_out , but he know that again she was scratch her nose . 
person was scratch her nose . 
the word ran crazily in his head : person is scratch her nose in the rain . 
then the word fall_into a pattern : `` person is scratch her nose , scratch her nose in the rain . 
person is scratch her nose in the rain '' . 
the pattern would not stop . 
it come again_and_again . 
he feel trap in that pattern , in the repetition . 
suddenly he think he might weep . 
`` what 's the_matter with me '' ? he demand out_loud . 
he look_around wildly around , at the now empty street , at the mud , at the rain . 
`` oh , what 's the_matter with me '' ? he demand . 
when he had store his stock in the great oak chest , lock the two big hasp and secure the additional chain , tie the fly of the tent , and pick_up the cash box , he move_up the darken street . 
he would consign the cash box into the hand of person , then stand_by while his employer check the content and the list of item sell . 
then he - 
then what ? 
he did not know . 
his mind close on that prospect , as though fog had descend to blot_out a valley . 
far-off , in the dusk , he hear voice sing , muffled but strong . 
in one of the hut a group of man were huddle_together , sing . 
he stop . 
he strain to hear . 
he hear the word : `` rock_of_ages , cleave for me , let me hide myself in thee ! 
let the water and the blood from thy rive side '' . 
he think : i be a jew from bavaria . 
he was stand there , he think , in virginia , in the thickening dusk , in a costly greatcoat that had belong_to another jew . 
that other jew , a young_man too , had leave_behind that greatcoat behind , in a rich house , and march away . 
he had cross the river which now , beyond the woods yonder , was slide darkly under the mist . 
he had plunge into the dark woods beyond . 
he had die there . 
what had that man , that other young jew , feel as he stand in the twilight and hear other man , faraway , sing together ? 
. 
person think_of the hutment , regiment after regiment , row after row , the thousand of hut , stretch away into the night . 
he think_of the man , the nameless thousand , huddle in them . 
he think_of person snore on his bunk while person crouch by the hearth , skirmish an undershirt for louse , and a wet log sizzle . 
he think_of person , who once had rise at the edge of a cornfield , a maniacal scream on his lip , and swing a clubbed musket like a flail to beat down the swirl of rebel bayonet about him . 
he think_of person rise_up , fearless in glory . 
he feel the sweetness of pity flood through him , vein his very flesh . 
those man , lie in the hut , they did not know . 
they did not know who they be or know their own worth . 
in the pity for them his loneliness be gone . 
then he think_of person stand in his rich house say : `` god be tired_of take the blame . 
he is going_to let history take the blame for_a_while '' . 
he think_of the old_man laugh under the glitter of the great chandelier . 
he think : only in my heart can i make the world hang_together . 
person rise from the crouch necessary to enter the hut . 
he see person squat by the hearth , break_up hardtack into a pan . 
a pot was boil on the coal . 
`` done give person all his money '' ? 
person ask softly . 
person nod . 
`` yeah '' , person murmur , `` yeah . 
and look what he done give us '' . 
person look at the pot . 
`` what be it '' ? he ask . 
`` chicken '' , person say , and theatrically lick his lip . 
`` gre't big fat chicken , yeah '' . 
he lick his lip again . 
then : `` yeah . 
a chicken with six tit and a tail lak a corkscrew . 
and hit squeal for slop '' . 
person giggle . 
`` fool you , huh ? 
it be the same ole same , tell me hit 's name . 
it be sowbelly with tit on . 
it be salt_po'k . 
it be salt_po'k and skippers . 
that po'k , it be so full of skippers it would jump and run and not come when you say , ' hoo-pig ' . 
had_to put my foot on_it to hole it down while i cut_up it up fer the lobscuse '' . 
he dump the pan of crumbled hardtack into the boil pot of lobscouse . 
`` good_ole lobscuse '' , he mumble , and stir the pot . 
he stop stir and look over his shoulder . 
`` know what person et tonight '' ? he demand . 
`` know what i had_to fix fer ole him '' ? 
person shake his head . 
`` chicken '' , person say . 
she be a child too much a part of her environment , too eager to grow and learn and experience . 
once , they be at location for the summer ( again , person say , a good place , even though they were being rob ) . 
one soft evening - that marvelous sea blessed time when the sun 's departing warmth linger and a smell of spume and wrack haunt everything - person had pick herself off the floor and begin to walk . 
person be on the couch read ; person was sit in an easy_chair about eight foot away . 
the infant , in white terrycloth bathrobe , her face intense and purposeful , had essay a_few wobbly step toward her father . 
`` y'all wanna walk - walk '' , he say . 
then , gently , he shove her behind toward person . 
person walk - make_it halfway across the cottage floor . 
she lose not a second , pick_up herself up and continue her pilgrimage to person . 
then person take her gently and shove her off again , toward person : 
person did not laugh - this be work , concentration , achievement . 
in a_few minute she was make the ten foot hike unaided ; soon she was parade around the house , flaunt her new skill . 
some liar 's logic , a wisp of optimism as fragile as the scent of tropical blossom that come_through the window ( a euphoria perhaps engender by the pill person had give her ) , console her for a moment . 
person had_to be safe , had_to come_back to them - if only to reap that share of life 's experience that be her due , if only to give her parent another chance to do_by better by her . 
through the swathing of terror , she jab deceit 's sharp point - person would be reborn , a new child , with new parent , live under new circumstance . 
the comfort be short-lived , yet she find herself return to the assurance whenever her imagination force image on her too awful to contemplate without the prop of illusion . 
gaze at her husband 's drugged body , his chest rise and fall in mindless rhythm , she see the grandeur of his fictional world , that lush garden from which he pluck flower and herb . 
she envy him . 
she admire him . 
in the darkness , she see him stir . 
he seem to be mutter , his voice surprisingly clear . 
`` y'all should have let me take_out that money out '' , person say . 
`` ' another minute i 'd have be fine . 
y'all should have let me do it '' . 
person touch his hand . 
`` yes , i know , person . 
i should have '' . 
the heat intensify on tuesday . 
location gasp and blink under an autumn hot_spell , dry , more enervating , more laden with man 's contrived impurity than the worst day of the summer past . 
it could continue this way , hit 106 and more in the location , person know , into october . 
he and person were sip coffee at the breakfast bar . 
both had be up since 7 : 00 - person on the early morning watch , person unable to sleep during his four hour relief . 
the night before , they had telephone the person , person , and she had arrive early , burst her vigorous presence into the silent house with an assurance that amuse person and confound person . 
the latter , thank her for the coffee , had wink and mutter , `` sure_'_nuff , honey '' . 
person be the wrong woman for these crudity . 
with a hard eye , she inform person : `` do n't sure_'_nuff me , officer . 
i'm honey only to my husband , understand '' ? 
person understand . 
the maid be very black and very energetic , trim in a yellow pique uniform . 
her speech be barren_of southernism ; she be one of person 's neutralized minority , adopt the rolling r 's and constricted vowel of location . 
not see her dark intelligent face , one would have gauge the voice as that of a location matron , ten year out of location . 
after she had serve the detective coffee and toast ( they politely decline eggs , uncomfortable about their tenancy ) , she settle_down with a morning newspaper and begin read the stock_market quotation . 
while she was thus engage , person question her about her whereabouts the previous day , any recollection she have of people hang_around , of overcurious delivery_boy or repairman , of strange car cruise the neighborhood . 
she answer him precisely , miss not a beat in her scrutiny of the financial report . 
person , person realize , be her own woman . 
she be the only kind of negro person would want around : independent , unservile , probably charge double what ordinary maid did for housework - and doubly efficient . 
when the parent emerge from the bedroom a_few minute later , the maid greet them quietly . 
`` i'm awful sorry about what 's happen '' , person say . 
`` maybe today 'll be a good news day '' . 
she charge off to the bedroom . 
person take his coffee into the nursery . 
during the night , a phone_company technician had deaden the bell and install red blinker on the phone . 
someone would have_to remain in the office continually . 
person greet the parent , then study his notebook . 
he wanted to take the mother to headquarters at_once and start her on the mug_file . 
`` sleep well '' ? he ask . 
person did not answer him . 
his face be bloated with drugging , red than normal . 
the woman have the glassy look of an invalid , as if she had not sleep at_all . 
`` oh - we manage '' , she say . 
`` i'm a_little groggy . 
did anything happen during the night '' ? 
`` few crank_call '' , person say . 
`` a_couple_of tip we 're run_down - nothing promising . 
we can expect more of the same . 
too bad your number be in the directory '' . 
`` did n't occur to me my child would be kidnap when i have it list '' , person mutter . 
he settle_on the sofa with his coffee , warm his hand on the cup , although the room be heavy with heat . 
the three have little to say to each other . 
the previous night 's horror - the absolute failure , overcast with the intrusion of the press , had leave them all with a wan sense of uselessness , of playacting . 
sip their coffee , discuss the weather , the day 's shopping , person 's commitment at the network ( all of which he would cancel ) , they avoid the radio , the morning tv news_show , even the front page of the santa_luisa_register , rest on the kitchen bar . 
kidnapper spurn ransom ; person still missing . 
once , person walk by it , hastily scan the bold black headline and the five column lead of the article ( by person , staff correspondent - age not give ) , and mutter : `` we a bunch national celebrity '' . 
person tell the parent he would escort them to police_headquarters in a half hour . 
before that , he wanted to talk to the neighbor . 
he did not want_to bring the person to the station_house too early - person had summon a press_conference , and he did n't want them subject to the reporter again . 
he could think_of nothing else to tell them : no assurance , no hopeful hint at great discovery that day . 
when the detective leave , person phone his secretary to cancel his work and to advise the network to get a substitute director for his current project . 
person was talk to the maid , arrange for her to come in every_day , instead of the four day she now work . 
outside , only a handful of reporter remain . 
the bulk of the press_corps was cover person 's conference . 
in_contrast to the caravan of the previous night , there be only four car parked across the street . 
two man he did not recognize were sip coffee and munch sweet_roll . 
he did not see person , or person , or person , or any of the feverish crew that had so harass him twelve hour ago . 
however , the litter remain , augment by several dozen lunchroom supper . 
the street_cleaner had not_yet be around . 
one of the reporter call to him : `` anything new , person '' ? 
and he ignore him , skirt the parked car and walk up the path to the person house . 
when person be halfway to the door , the proprietor emerge - a mountainous , dark man , his head thick_with resiny black hair , his eye like two of the black_olive he import in boatload . 
person identify himself . 
the master of the house , his nourished face unrevealing , consent to postpone his departure a_few minute to talk to the detective . 
inside , as_soon_as person had disclose - in a hoarse whisper - the detective 's errand , his family gather in a huddle , form a mass of dark flesh on and around a brocaded sofa which stand at one side of a baroque fireplace . 
flank by marble urn and alabaster lamp , they seem to be pose for a tribal portrait . 
it be amazing how they had herd together for protection : an enormous matriarch in a quilted silk wrapper , rise from the breakfast_table ; a gross boy in his teens , shuffle in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hand ; a girl in her twenties , fat and sullen , descend the marble staircase ; then all four gather on the sofa to face the inquisitor . 
they answer him in monosyllable , nod , occasionally mutter in greek to one another , await the word from person , who restlessly crack his knuckle , anxious to stuff himself into his white cadillac and burst off to the freeway . 
no , they had n't see anyone around ; no , they did n't know the person family ; yes , they had read about the case ; yes , they had let some reporter use their phone , but they would no_longer . 
they offer no opinion , volunteer nothing , betray no emotion . 
study them , person could not help make comparison with the person couple . 
the person people seem to him of that breed of human_being whose insularity free them from tragedy . 
he imagine they be the kind whose tax_return were never examine ( if they were , they were never penalize ) , whose child have no unhappy romance , whose name never know scandal . 
the equation be simple : wealth bring them happiness , and their united front to the world be their warning that they mean to keep everything they have , let_in no_one in on the secret . 
by comparison , person and person be quiver fledgling . 
they possess no outer fortification , no hard shell of confidence ; they have enough difficulty get from day to day , let_alone having an awful crime thrust upon them . 
person express no curiosity over the case , offer no expression of sympathy , make no move to escort person to the door . 
all four remain impacted on the sofa until he had leave . 
he had speak_to person the previous day . 
there remain a family name person , owner of a two story tudor style house on the south_side of the person home . 
their name had not come_up in any discussion with person , and he have no idea what they would be like . 
person note the immaculate lawn and garden : each blade of grass cropped , bright and firm ; each shrub glaze with good_health . 
the door was answer by a slender man in his sixties - straight-backed , somewhat clerical in manner , wear rimless glasses . 
when person identify himself , he nod , unsmiling , and usher him into a sedate living_room . 
person join them . 
she have a dried-out quality - a gray , lean woman , not unattractive . 
both be dressed rather formally . 
the man wear a vest and a tie , the woman have_on a dark green dress and three strand of pearl . 
`` funny thing '' , person say , when they be seated , `` when i hear you ring , i figure it was that guy down the block , person '' . 
person look puzzled . 
person continue : `` i fix his dog the other day and i guess he be sore , so i expect him to come barge_in '' . 
person go_on to explain how person 's fox_terrier had been `` make '' in his flowerbed . 
the dog refuse to be scare_off , so person had purchase some small firecracker . 
he would lie in wait in the garage , and when the terrier come scratch around , he 'd let_fly with a cherry_bomb . 
`` scare the hell out of him '' , person grin . 
`` i hit him in the ass once '' . 
both grin at the detective . 
`` finally , all i need be to throw a little piece of red wood that look_like a firecracker and that dumb dog would run ki-yi-ing for his life '' . 
in the dim underwater light they dress and straighten up the room , and then they go across the hall to the kitchen . 
she was intimidate by the stove . 
he find the pilot_light and turn_on one of the burner for her . 
the gas flame_up two inch high . 
they find the teakettle and put water on to boil and then search through the icebox . 
several section of a loaf of dark_bread ; butter ; jam ; a tiny cake of ice . 
in their search for what turn_out to be the right breakfast china but the wrong table silver , they open every cupboard door in the kitchen and pantry . 
while she was settle the teacart , he go_back across the hall to their bedroom , open one of the suitcase , and take_out powdered coffee and sugar . 
she appear with the teacart and he open the window . 
`` do you want to call person '' ? 
he did n't , but it be not really a question , and so he leave the room , walk down the hall to the front of the apartment , hesitate , and then knock lightly on the closed door of the study . 
a sleepy voice answer . 
`` le petit_dejeuner '' , person say , in an accent that do credit to person , his high_school french_teacher . 
at_the_same_time , his voice betray uncertainty about their be here , and convey an appeal to whatever be reasonable , peace-loving , and dependable in everybody . 
since ordinary breakfast_table conversation be impossible , it was at_least something that they be able to offer person the sugar_bowl with their sugar in it , and the plate of bread_and_butter , and that person could return the pitcher of hot milk to them handle first . 
person put a spoonful of powdered coffee into his cup and then fill it with hot water . 
stir , he say : `` i be sorry that my work prevent me from doing anything with you today '' . 
they assure him that they did not expect or need to be entertain . 
person put a teaspoonful of powdered coffee in his cup and fill it with hot water , and then , stir , he sit_back in his chair . 
the chair creak . 
every time he move or say something , the chair creak again . 
person be not entirely silent , or openly rude - unless ask person to move to another chair and place himself in the fauteuil that creak so alarmingly be an act of rudeness . 
it go_on right on creak under his own considerable weight , and all it need , person think , be for somebody to fling himself back in a fit of laughter and that would be the end of_it . 
through the open window they hear sound below in the street : cartwheel , a tired horse 's plodding step , voice . 
person indicate the photograph on the wall and ask what church the stone sculpture be in . 
person tell him and he promptly forget . 
they pass the marmalade , the bread , the black-market butter , back_and_forth . 
nothing was say about hotel or train journey . 
person offer person his car , to use at any time he care to , and when this offer was not accept , the armchair creak . 
they all three have another cup of coffee . 
person be in his pajamas and dressing_gown , and on his large foot he wear yellow turkish slipper that turn_up at the toe . 
`` excuse me '' , he say in berlitz_english , and get_up and leave them , to bathe and dress . 
the first shrill ring of the telephone bring person out into the hall . 
he realize that he have no idea where the telephone be . 
at that moment the bathroom door fly_open and person come_out , with his face lather for shaving , and stride down the hall , tie the sash of his dressing_gown as he go . 
the telephone be in the study but the ringing come from the hall . 
between the telephone and the wall_plug there be sixty foot of cord , and when the conversation come to an end , person carry the instrument with him the whole length of the apartment , to his bathroom , where it ring three more time while he was shaving and in the tub . 
before he leave the apartment he knock on their door and ask if there be anything he could do for them . 
person shake his head . 
`` person call a_few minute ago '' , person say . 
`` she want you and person to have dinner with her tomorrow night '' . 
he hand person a key to the front_door , and caution him against leave it unlocked while they be out of the apartment . 
when enough time had elapse so_that there be little likelihood of his return for something he had forget , person go_out into the hall and stand look into one room after another . 
in the room next to theirs be a huge cradle , of mahogany , ornately carve and decorate with gold_leaf . 
it be the most important-looking cradle he had ever see . 
then come their bathroom , and then a bedroom that , judge by the photograph on the wall , must belong_to person . 
a young_woman who look_like person , with her two child . 
person and person on their wedding_day . 
matching photograph in oval frame of person and an elderly man who must be person 's grandfather . 
person , considerably young and very different . 
the schoolboy . 
and a gray-haired man whose glance - direct , lifelike , and mildly accusing - was contradict by the gilt and black frame . 
it be the kind of frame that is only put around the photograph of a dead_person . 
person , could it be ? 
with the metal shutter closed , the dining_room be so dark that it seem still night in there . 
one of the drawing_room shutter be partly open and he make_out the shape of chair and sofa , which seem to be upholster in brown or russet velvet . 
the curtain be of the same material , and there be some big oil_painting - portrait in the style of person and person . 
though , take individually , the big room be , or seem to be , square , the apartment as a whole form a triangle . 
the apex , the study where person sleep , be light and bright and airy and cheerful . 
the window look_out_on the location - it be the only window of the apartment that did . 
look_around slowly , he see a marble fireplace , a desk , a low bookcase of mahogany with crisscrossed brass wire instead of glass pane in the door . 
the daybed person had sleep in , make_up now with its dark-brown velours cover and pillow . 
the portable record_player with a pile of classical record beside it . 
person 's fifth be the one on top . 
da-da-da-dum . 
music could not be person 's passion . 
besides , the record be dusty . 
he try the door of the bookcase . 
lock . 
the title he could read easily through the crisscrossed wire : work on theology , astral physics , history , biology , political_science . 
no poetry . 
no novel . 
he move_over to the desk and stand look at the paper on_it but not touch anything . 
the clock on the mantel was scandalize and tick so loudly that he glance at it over his shoulder and then quickly leave the room . 
the concierge call_out to them as they were pass_through the foyer . 
her quarters be on the right as you walk into the building , and her small front_room was clog with heavy furniture - a big , round , oak dining_table and chair , a buffet , with a row of unclaimed letter insert between the mirror and its frame . 
the suitcase had come while they be out , and had been put in their room , the concierge say . 
he wait until they be inside the elevator and then say : `` now what do we do '' ? 
`` call the person , i guess '' . 
`` i guess '' . 
rather_than sit around wait for the suitcase to be deliver , they had go sightseeing . 
they go to the flea_market , expect to find the treasure of location , and find instead a duplication of that long double row of booth in location . 
cheap clothing and junk of every sort , as far as the eye could see . 
they look , even_so . 
look at everything . 
person buy some cotton apron , and person buy shoestring . 
they have lunch at a sidewalk cafe overlook the intersection of two broad , busy , unpicturesque street , and come home they get lost in the metro ; it take them over an hour to get_back to the station where they should have change , in_order to take the line that go to the location . 
it be the end of the afternoon when he take the huge key out of his pocket and insert it into the keyhole . 
when he open the door , there stand person , on his way out_of the apartment . 
he was wear sneaker and shorts and an open-collared shirt , and in his hand he carry a little black bag . 
he did not explain where he was go , and they did not ask . 
instead , they go_on down the hall to their room . 
`` do you think he could be have an affair '' ? 
person ask , as they hear the front_door close . 
`` oh_no '' , person say , shock . 
`` well , this be france , after_all '' . 
`` i know , but there must be some other explanation . 
he 's probably spend the evening with friend '' . 
`` and for that he need a little bag '' ? 
they go shopping in the neighborhood , and buy two loaf_of_bread with the ration coupon they had been give in location , and some cheese , and a dozen eggs , and a bag of orange from a peddler in the location - the first orange they had see since they land . 
they have vermouth , sit in_front_of a cafe . 
when they get home person be grateful for the stillness in the apartment , and think how , under different circumstance , they might have stay_on here , in these old-fashioned , high-ceilinged room that remind him of the person ' apartment in the location . 
they could have be perfectly happy here for ten whole day . 
he go down the hall to person 's bathroom , to turn_on the hot-water_heater , and on the side of the tub he see a pair of blue wool swimming_trunks . 
he feel them . 
they be damp . 
he reach_out and feel the bath_towel hang_on the towel_rack over the tub . 
damp also . 
he look_around the room and then call_out : 
`` come here , quick '' ? 
`` what be it '' ? 
person ask , stand in the doorway . 
`` i 've solve the mystery of the little bag . 
there it be * * h and there be what be in it . 
but where do people go swim in location ? 
that boat in the river , maybe '' . 
`` what boat '' ? 
`` there 's a big boat anchor near the location , with a swimming_pool in it - did n't you notice it ? 
but if he have time to go swim , he have time to be with us '' . 
she look at him in surprise . 
`` i know '' , he say , read her mind . 
`` i do n't know what i'm going_to do with you '' . 
`` it 's because we be in location '' , he say , `` and know so few people . 
so something like this matter more_than it would at home . 
also , he be so nice when he be nice '' . 
`` all because i did n't feel_like dance '' . 
`` i do n't think it be that , really '' . 
`` then what be it '' ? 
`` i do n't know . 
i wish i did . 
the tweed coat , maybe . 
the thing about person be that he 's very proud '' . 
and the thing about hurt feelings , the wet bathing_suit point_out , be that the person who have them be not quite the innocent party he believe himself to be . 
for_instance - what about all those people person go toward unhesitatingly , as if this be the one moment they would ever have together , their one chance of know each other ? 
fortunately , the embarrassing question raise by object do not need to be answer , or we would all have_to go sleep in the open field . 
and in_any_case , answer may clarify but they do not change anything . 
he bring with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes , of about a_hundred pound ' weight . 
they take jesus 's body , then , and wrap it in winding-clothes with the spice ; that is how the jew prepare a body for burial . 
list as present at the descent be person , person 's sister , mary_magdalene , person , person , person . 
search as he might , he could find no place where the bible speak of a moment when person could have be alone with jesus . 
mostly the scene be crowded with mourner , such_as the dramatic dell'arca_lamentation in location , where the grief-stricken spectator had usurp person 's last poignant moment . 
in his concept there could be no_one else present . 
his first desire be to create a mother and son alone in the universe . 
when might person have have that moment to hold her child on her lap ? 
perhaps after the soldier had lay him on the ground , while person be at person 's ask for christ 's body , person was gather his mixture of myrrh and aloes , and the others had go_home to mourn . 
those who see his finished pieta would take the place of the biblical witness . 
they would feel what person was undergo . 
there would be no halo , no angel . 
these would be two human_being , whom god had choose . 
he feel close to person , having spend so long concentrate_on the beginning of her journey . 
now she be intensely alive , anguished ; her son be dead . 
even_though he would later be resurrect , he be at this moment dead indeed , the expression on his face reflect what he had go_through on the cross . 
in his sculpture therefore it would not be possible for him to project anything of what jesus feel for his mother ; only what person feel for her son . 
jesus ' inert body would be passive , his eye closed . 
person would have_to carry the human communication . 
this seem right to him . 
it be a relief to shift in his mind to technical problem . 
since his christ was to be life-size , how was person to hold him on her lap without the relationship seem ungainly ? 
his person would be slender of limb and delicate of proportion , yet she must hold this full-grown man as securely and convincingly as she would a child . 
there be only one way to accomplish this : by design , by draw diagram and sketch in which he probe the remote corner of his mind for creative idea to carry his concept . 
he start by make free sketch to loosen_up his thinking so_that image would appear on paper . 
visually , these approximate what he was feel within himself . 
at_the_same_time he start walk the street , peer at the people pass or shop_at the stall , store up fresh impression of what they look_like , how they move . 
in_particular he seek the gentle , sweet-faced nun , with head_covering and veil come to the middle of their forehead , remember their expression until he reach home and set_down them down on paper . 
discover that drapery could be design to serve structural purpose , he begin a study of the anatomy of fold . 
he improvise as he go_along , complete a life-size clay figure , then buy yard of an inexpensive material from a draper , wet the lightweight cloth in a basin and cover it over with clay that person bring from the bank of the tiber , to the consistency of thick mud . 
no fold could be accidental , each turn of the drapery had to serve organically , to cover the person 's slender leg and foot so that they would give substantive support to christ 's body , to intensify her inner turmoil . 
when the cloth dry and stiffen , he see what adjustment had to be make . 
`` so that 's sculpture '' , comment person wryly , when he had sluice down the floor for a week , `` make mud pie '' . 
person grin . 
`` see , person , if you control the way these fold are bunch , like this , or make to flow , you can enrich the body attitude . 
they can have as much tactile appeal as flesh_and_bone '' . 
he go_into the location , want to draw hebraic face so_that he could reach a visual understanding of how christ might have look . 
the jewish section be in location , near the tiber at the church of group . 
the colony had be small until the spanish_inquisition_of_1492 drive many jew into location . 
here , for_the_most_part , they were well treat , as a `` reminder of the old_testament heritage of christianity '' ; many_of their gifted member be prominent in the vatican as physician , musician , banker . 
the man did not object to his sketch them while they go_about their work , but no_one could be persuade to come to his studio to pose . 
he was tell to ask for person at the synagogue on saturday afternoon . 
person find the rabbi in the room of study , a gentle old_man with a white beard and luminous grey eye , robe in black gabardine with a skullcap on his head . 
he was read from the talmud with a group of man from his congregation . 
when person explain why he had come , person reply gravely : 
`` the bible forbid us to bow_down to or to make graven_image . 
that is why our creative people give their time to literature , not to painting or sculpture '' . 
`` but , person , you do n't object to others create work_of_art '' ? 
`` not at all . 
each religion have its own tenet '' . 
`` i am carve a pieta from white location marble . 
i wish to make jesus an authentic jew . 
i cannot accomplish this if you will not help me '' . 
the rabbi say thoughtfully , `` i would not want my people to get_in trouble with the church '' . 
`` i am work for the cardinal of location . 
i'm sure he would approve '' . 
`` what kind of model would you prefer '' ? 
`` workman . 
in their mid-thirties . 
not bulky laborer , but sinewy man . 
with intelligence . 
and sensitivity '' . 
person smile at him with infinitely old but merry eye . 
`` leave me your address . 
i will send you the best the quarter have to offer '' . 
person hurry to person 's solitary bachelor room with his sketch , ask the architect to design a stand which would simulate the seated person . 
person study the drawing and improvise a trestle couch . 
person buy some scrap lumber . 
together he and person build the stand , cover it with blanket . 
his first model arrive at dusk . 
he hesitate for a moment when person ask him to disrobe , so person give him a piece of toweling to wrap around his loins , lead him to the kitchen to take_off his clothes . 
he then drape him over the rough stand , explain that he be supposed to be recently dead , and was being hold on his mother 's lap . 
the model quite plainly think person crazy ; only the instruction from his rabbi keep him from bolt . 
but at the end of the sitting , when person show him the quick , free drawing , with the mother rough in , hold her son , the model grasp what person be_after , and promise to speak_to his friend . 
he work for two hour a day with each model send by the rabbi . 
person present quite a different problem . 
though this sculpture must take_place thirty-three years after her moment of decision , he could not conceive_of her as a woman in her mid-fifties , old , wrinkled , broken in body and face by labor or worry . 
his image of the_virgin had always be that of a young_woman , even as had his memory of his mother . 
person introduce him into several roman home . 
here he sketch , sit in their flowing gown of linen and silk , young_girl not_yet twenty , some about to be marry , some married a year or two . 
since the group had take only man , he had have no experience in the study of female anatomy ; but he had sketch the woman of location in their field and home . 
he be able to discern the body line of the roman woman under their robe . 
he spend concentrated week put his two figure together : a person who would be young and sensitive , yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap ; and a jesus who , though lean , be strong even in death - a look he remember well from his experience in the dead_room of group . 
he draw toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory , without need to consult his sketch . 
soon he be ready to go into a three-dimensional_figure in clay . 
here he would have free expression because the material could be move to distort form . 
when he wanted to emphasize , or get great intensity , he add or subtract clay . 
next he turn_to wax because there be a similarity of wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence . 
he respect each of these approach technique , and keep them in character : 
his quill drawing have a scratchiness , suggest skin texture ; the clay he use plastically to suggest soft moving flesh , as in an abdomen , in a reclining torso ; the wax he smooth_over to give the body surface an elastic pull . 
yet he never allow these model to become fixed in his mind ; they remain rough starting_point . 
when carve he be charged with spontaneous energy ; too-careful or detailed study in clay and wax would have glue him down to a mere enlarge of his model . 
the true surge had to be inside the marble itself . 
drawing and model be his thinking . 
carve be action . 
the arrangement with person was work well , except that sometimes person could not figure who be master and who apprentice . 
person had been train so rigorously by the jesuit that person be unable to change his habit : up before dawn to scrub the floor , whether they be dirty or not ; water boil on the fire for wash laundry every_day , the pot scour with river sand after each meal . 
`` person , this be senseless '' , he complain , not like to work on the wet floor , particularly in cold_weather . 
`` you be too clean . 
scrub the studio once a week . 
that 's enough '' . 
`` no '' , say person stolidly . 
`` every_day . 
before dawn . 
i was teach '' . 
`` and god help anyone who try to unteach you '' ! 
grumble person ; yet he know that he have nothing to grumble about , for person make few demand on him . 
the boy was become acquainted_with the contadini family that bring produce into location . 
on sunday he would walk mile into the campagna to visit with them , and in_particular to see their horse . 
the one thing he miss from his farm in the location be the animal ; frequently he would take_leave his leave of person by announce : 
`` today i go see the horse '' . 
it take a piece of bad_luck to show person that the boy be devoted to him . 
he was crouch over his anvil in the courtyard get his chisel into trim , when a splinter of steel fly into his eye and imbed itself in his pupil . 
he stumble into the house , eye burn like fire . 
person make him lie_down on the bed , bring a pan of hot water , dip some clean white linen cloth and apply it to extract the splinter . 
though the pain be considerable person be not too concerned . 
he assume he could blink the splinter out . 
but it would not come_out . 
person never leave his side , keep the water boil , apply hot compress throughout the night . 
by the second day person begin to worry ; and by the second night he be in a state of panic : he could see nothing out of the afflicted eye . 
at dawn person go_to person . 
person arrive with his family surgeon , person . 
the surgeon carry a cage of live pigeon . 
he tell person to take a bird out of the cage , cut a large vein under its wing , let the blood gush into person 's injured eye . 
the surgeon come_back at dusk , cut the vein of a second pigeon , again wash out the eye . 
person be very still and her breath come in small jerking gasp . 
the thin leg twitch convulsively once , then person feel the little body stiffen in her arm and hear one strangled sound . 
the scant flesh grow cool beneath her frantic hand . 
the child be gone . 
when person awake , person was still rock the dead child , still croon in disbelief , `` no , no , oh , no ! '' 
they put person to bed and wire person and send_for the young presbyterian minister . 
he sit beside person 's bed with the others throughout the morning , talk , talk of god 's will , while person lie stare angrily at him . 
when he tell her god had call the child to him , she reject his word rebelliously . 
few of the neighbor come , but person come , call by tragedy . 
`` it always come in three '' , she sigh heavily . 
`` trouble never come but in three '' . 
they hold the funeral the next morning from the crossroads church and bury the little box in the quiet family plot . 
person move through all the preparation and service in a state of bewilderment . 
she would not accept the death of such a little child . 
`` god call her to him '' , the minister had say . 
god would not do that , person think stubbornly . 
person 's letter come , as she know it would , and he had accept their child 's death as another judgment from god against both person and himself . 
in blind panic of grief she accept person 's dictum , and believe in her desperation that she had been curse by god . 
she hold person 's letter , his word burn like a brand , and know suddenly that the bond between them were sever . 
she have nothing left but her duty to his land and his son . 
person come and sit mutely with her , share her pain and anguish , avert his eye from the ice_pack on her bosom . 
person and person keep person in bed a week until her milk dry . 
when she return to life in the big house she feel shriveled of all emotion save dedication to duty . 
she discipline herself daily to do what must be do . 
she had even steel herself to keep person upstairs in the nurse 's room off the empty nursery , although the girl try to insist on move_back to the quarters to spare person remembrance of the baby 's death . 
person droop about the place , wear a haunted , brooding look , which person attribute to the baby 's death , until the day a letter come for her addressed to `` person '' , bear a location postmark . 
see the slanting hand , person know uneasily that it was from the yankee colonel . 
the federal force had take location and location from the rebel and were move to take all the mountain . 
person try to contain her curiosity and foreboding at what the letter portend , at what involvement exist for person . 
person and person had replant the bottomland with difficulty , for more of the slave , include person , had sneak_off when the soldier break_camp . 
person work like a fieldhand in the afternoon after school . 
he had be at lesson in the schoolhouse since they return from location . 
person feel she had desert the boy in her own loss . 
she love him and miss his company . 
person had been ride out every evening on some secret business of his own . 
what it be person could not fathom . 
he claim to be visit the waterfront saloon at the crossroads to play card and drink with his crony , but person had not smell brandy on him since person 's funeral . 
person know what he was_about , however . 
`` you 're gonna get catch '' , she hear person say to person by the pump one morning . 
`` not this old fox '' , chuckle person . 
`` everybody know i'm just a harmless , deaf old_man who take_to drink . 
i aim to keep a_little whisky still back in the ridge for my pleasure '' . 
`` whisky still , my_foot '' , say person . 
`` you 're back there ride with the guerrilla , the group '' . 
`` hush '' , say person , smile , `` or i 'll give you another black_eye '' . 
he pat the eye person had have blacken in a fight over be rebel at the crossroads some day back . 
person have no idea what they were talk of , although she had see the blue light and strange fire burn and wink on the ridge at night , had hear horseman on the location and hill trail through the night till dawn . 
stranger , person begin ride home night with a jug strap to his saddle , drunkenly sing `` old_dan_tucker '' at the top of his voice . 
hear his voice ring raucously up from the road , person would await him anxiously and watch perplexed as he walk into the house , cold_sober . 
what he was_about become clear to her with the circulation of another broadside proclamation by person , threaten reprisal against rebel guerrilla . 
she be taken_up in worry for the reckless old_man . 
person drew more_and_more on her affection for person through the hot day of summer work . 
she had take_out him out of the schoolhouse and close the school for the summer , after she see person crack person across the face with a ruler for let a snake loose in the schoolroom . 
person had walk past the school on her morning chore and had see the whole incident , had see person 's burning humiliation before person 's cold , bespectacled wrath . 
he have the hard pains of grow before him now , as he approach twelve . 
these would be his hard years , she know , and he miss his father desperately . 
she try to find some way to draw_out him out , to help him . 
whenever she find time , she go blackberry pick with him , and they would come home together , mouth purple , arm and face scratched , tire enough to forget grief for another day . 
he tend the new colt person had sire . 
he help person and person enlarge the flower_garden in the side_yard , where they sometimes sit in the still evening watch the last fat bee work against the summer 's purple dusk . 
no one go much to the crossroads now except person . 
they stay in their own world on the bluff , wait for letter and the peddler , bring the news . 
person write grimly of the destruction of location before they abandon it ; of their first engagement at location after person 's group had destroy all the rolling_stock of the group . 
the men be restive , he write , ready to take the battle to the enemy as person wish . 
the peddler come bawl his wares and tell them of the convention in location , which had form a new state_government by declare the government at location in the east illegal because they be traitor .

when person hurry in alarm to tell him to put_out it out , she see other dot of flame among the western virginia hills from the few scattered fire of the faithful .

`` no , the decision be yours . 
i have hold your papers of manumission since i marry person '' . 
the red glow from the cove had die_out of the sky . 
the two in the bed know each other as old people know the partner with whom they have share the same bed for many years , and they needed to say no_more . 
the thing leave unsaid they both feel deeply , and with a sigh they fall_back on the well stuffed pillow . 
person put_out the remaining candle with a long snuffer , and in the smell of scented candlewick , the comforting awareness of each other 's body , the retained pattern of dancer and guest remember , their mind grow numb and then empty_of image . 
they sleep - person with a marvelously high-pitched snoring , the damn seahorse ivory tooth watch him from a bedside table . 
in the ballroom below , the dark had give_way to moonlight come_in through the bank of french_window . 
it be a delayed moon , but now the sky had clear of scud black and the star sugar the silver_gray sky . 
person , old , slow , careful of foot , come_down the great staircase , dressed in her best lace-drawn black silk , her jeweled shoe buckle hold forward . 
`` well , i'm here at_last '' , she say , address the old portrait on the wall . 
`` i do n't hear the music . 
i am get deaf , i must admit it '' . 
she come to the ballroom and stand on the two carpeted steps that lead down to it . 
`` where be everyone ? 
i_say , where be everyone ? 
person , you lummox , you 've forget to order the musician '' . 
she stand there , a large old_woman , smile at the thing she would say to him in the morning , this big foolish baby of a son . 
there be time now , like this , when she lose_control of the time count and move freely back_and_forth into three generation . 
be it a birthday ball ? 
when person had reach his majority at eighteen ? 
or be it her own first ball as mistress of this big house , a location bride from way upstate near albany , from location . 
and this handsome booby , stare and sweat , be he her bridegroom ?

he had ride hard from boston , and he be not used_to horseback . 
now , drive the horse and sulky borrow from person , he feel as if every bone was topped by burning oil and that every muscle be ready to dissolve into jelly and leave his big body helpless and unable to move . 
the road lead south along the river be shaded with old tree , and in the moonlight the silvery landscape be like a setting for troll and wood god rather_than the hudson_river valley of his boyhood memory . 
he slap the rein on the back of the powerful gray horse and hold_on as the sulky 's wheel hit a pothole and come_out with a jolt and go_on . 
he would cross to manhattan , to location , before morning . 
there a certain farmhouse be a station for the group . 
he would send_on by trusted messenger the dispatch with their electrifying news . 
and he would sleep , sleep , and never think_of road and horse ' sore haunch , of colonial war . 
strange how everything here fit back into his life , even if he had be away so long . 
person , person , the valley society , the very smell of the river on his right purl along to the bay past fish weir and rock , and ahead the sleepy ribbon of moon drenched road . 
a mist was walking on the water , white as cotton , but with a blending and merging grace . 
ahead there be a stirring of sudden movement at a crossroad . 
person reach for the pair of pistol in the saddlebag at his foot . 
he pull_out one of them and cock it . 
a strange wood creature come float up from a patch of berry bush . 
it be a grotesque hen , five or six foot tall . 
it have the feature of a man bewhiskered by clump of loose feather . 
it run , this apocalyptic beast , on two thin leg , and its wing - be they feathered arm ? 
- flap as it run . 
its groin be bloody . 
black strip of skin hang from it . 
the horse shy at the dreadful thing and flare its nostrils . 
person took_a_firm_hand with it . 
the creature in feather look_around and person see the mad eye , glaze with an insane fear . 
the ungainly bird thing run_away , and to person its croaking sound like the crow of a tormented rooster . 
then it be go . 
he drive on , wary and shaken . 
the group be out tonight . 
new_york lie bleach in the summer sun , and the morning fish_hawk , fly in the heated air , see below him the long triangular wedge of location . 
it be thickly_settled by fifteen thousand citizen and lay_out into pig infested street , mostly around the location , go bravely north to wall_street , but give_up and become field and farm in the region of location . 
from there it look_across at location and the hudson_river where the manor_house , estate , and big farm of the original ( non indian ) landowner begin . 
on the east_side of the island of manhattan the indifferent hawk know the location that connect new_york_bay with long_island_sound . 
on the western tip of long_island protrude location . 
it command a view over manhattan and the harbor . 
a fringe of housing and garden beard the top of the heights , and behind it be sandy road lead past farm and hayfield . 
husbandry was bound by snake-rail_fence , and there be graze cattle . 
on the shore north and south , the fisher and mooncurser - smuggler - live along the churning location and the narrow barrier of sand , location . 
the morning hawk , hungry for any eatable , killable , digestible item , keep his eye on the ring of anchor ship that lie off the shore in the bay , sheltered by the new_jersey inlet . 
they often throw tidbit overboard . 
the larger ship be near location , already be called , by a_few , location . 
these be the ship of his person 's navy , herd the hulk of the location merchant and the yacht and ketch of the loyalist . 
the news of battle on location had already seep through , and new_york itself was now leave in the hands of the local group . 
the fish_hawk , his wing not move , circle and glide low . 
the gilt stern of the man-of-war become clear to him , the side of the wooden sea wall alternately painted yellow and black , the bronze cannon at the port . 
the captain 's gig of h.m.s._mercury was being row to h.m.s._neptune . 
on shore `` the freed slave to despotism '' - the town dweller - watch the ship and wait . 
the chevaux-de-frise , those sharp stake and barrier around the fort at the location , point to a conflict between the town and sea_power roll in glassy swell as the tide come_in . 
across the bay the location be heavy in green timber ; their rock path lead down to the hudson . 
below in the open bay face manhattan be staten_island , gritty with clamshell and mud_flat behind which nest farm , cattle barn , and berry thicket . 
along location in location , past the white church at location , past location on the east bank of the hudson , to the white salt crusted road of the location there be a watching and an activity of prepare_for something explosive to happen . 
today , tomorrow , six month , even perhaps a year . 
the fish_hawk fly_on and be lose from sight . 
the british ship roll at anchor , send_out picket_boat and wait for order from location . 
wait for more ship , more lobster-backed infantry , and ask what was to be done with a war of rebellion ? 
person , having sleep away a day and a night , come awake in a plank farmhouse on the location near location . 
he look_out through windowpane turn a faint violet by sun and weather , look_out at location toward location . 
the road seem animated with a few more wagon than usual ; a carriage raise_up the choking june dust , and beyond , in a meadow , a local militia company drill with musket , kentuck ' rifle , every kind of horse pistol , old sword , or cutlass . 
the wraithlike event of the last few day flood person 's mind and he rub his unshaved chin and feel again the ache in his kidney cause by his saddle odyssey from boston . 
pensive , introspective , he ache . 
he had send the dispatch downtown to the proper people and had sleep . 
now there be more to do . 
order not write_down had_to be transmit to the local provincial government . 
he scratch his mosquito plagued neck . 
from the saddlebag , hang_on a hitchcock_chair , person take_out a good english razor , a present from person . 
he find tepid water in a pitcher and a last bite of soap , and he lather his face and stand strop the razor on his broad leather belt , its buckle hold firm by a knob of the bedpost . 
he hope he be free_of self-deception . 
here he be , suddenly caught_up in the delirium of a war , in the spite and calumny of whig and tory . 
there would be great need soon for his skill as surgeon , but somehow he had not plan to use his knowledge merely for war . 
person have certain psychic intuition that this rebellion be not wholly what it appear on the surface . 
he know that many were use it for their own end . 
but it did not matter . 
he strop the razor slowly ; what matter was that a new concept of american was be born . 
that some man did not want it he could understand . 
the moral aridity of merchant make them loyal usually to their ledger . 
yet some , like person , would bankrupt themselves for the new idea . 
unique circumstance would test us all , he decide . 
injury and ingratitude would occur . 
no_doubt person would do well now ; war be a smuggler ' heaven . 
and what of that poor tarred-and-feathered wretch he had see on the road drive down from person 's ? 
thing like that would increase rather_than be do_away_with . 
one had_to believe_in final event or one was strand in the abyss of nothing . 
he see with person now that the perfectability of man be a dream . 
life be a short play of tenebrous shadow . 
person begin to shave with great sweeping stroke . 
time play an essential part in our mortality , and suddenly for no reason he could imagine ( or admit ) the image of person laugh fill his mind - so desirable , so lusty , so full of nuance of pleasure and joy . 
he drive_off sensual pattern off , carefully shave his long upper lip . 
it be hard , he mutter , to meditate on man ( or woman ) than on god . 
person finish shave , wash his face clean of lather , and comb and retie his hair . 
he be proud that he had never wear a wig . 
more_and_more of the colonial were wear their own hair and not use powder . 
he feel cheerful again , refreshed ; presentable in his wide-cut brown suit , the well-made riding_boot . 
it be so easy to falsify sentiment . 
in the meadow below , militia officer shout at their men and on location two boy sit fish . 
the future would happen ; he did not have_to hurry it by think too_much . 
a man could be toss outside the dimension of time by a stray bullet these day . 
he begin to pack the saddlebag . 
and all this too shall pass_away : it come to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church_service when he be a boy - yes , in a white church with a thin spur steeple in the patriarchal location , where a feeling of plenitude be normal in those english dutch manor with their well-fed squire . 
burly leathered man and wrinkled woman in drab black rag carry_on in a primitive way , almost unchanged from feudal times . 
peasant puzzle person . 
he wonder how they could go_on in poverty , superstition , ignorance , with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their life flourish . 
person remember a bathyran meeting long_ago . 
person had return from the colony in location and , before the national leadership , exalt the miracle of dry_up swamp and irrigate the desert . 
a fund-raising_drive to buy tractor and machinery was launch . 
person remember that his own reaction had be one of indifference . 
had he find the meaning too late ? 
it aggravate him . 
the land of the location be rich , but no_one seem to care . 
in the unfertile land in location human break_one's_back their backs push willpower to the brink . 
he had sit beside person at the rostrum of a congress of zionist . 
all_of them be there in this loosely_knit association of diversified ideology , and each berate the other and beat his breast for his own approach . 
when person rise to speak , the hall become silent . 
`` i do not care if your belief take you along a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of activism . 
we be here because all our path travel a blind course through a thick forest , seek human dignity . 
beyond the forest all our path merge into a single great highway which end in the barren , eroded hills of location . 
this be our singular goal . 
how we travel through the forest be for each man 's conscience . 
where we end our journey be always the same . 
we all seek the same thing through different way - an end to this long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuse which will continue to plague us until the star_of_david fly over location '' . 
this be how person express pure zionism . 
it had sound good to person , but he did not believe it . 
in his heart he have no desire to go_to palestine . 
he loathe the idea of dry_up swamp or the chill of malaria or of leaving his natural birthright . 
before he go_into battle person had tell person , `` i only want to be a pole . 
warsaw be my city , not tel_aviv '' . 
and now person sit on a train on_the_way to location and wonder if he was not being punish for his lack of belief . 
warsaw ! 
he see the smug eye of the group chief , roman , and all the roman and the face of the peasant who hold only hatred for him . 
they had let this black_hole of death in warsaw 's heart exist without a cry of protest . 
once there had be big glittering room where person bow and kiss the lady ' hand as they flirt from behind their fan . 
warsaw ! 
warsaw ! 
`` person . 
i be a jew '' . 
day_by_day , week_by_week , month_by_month , the betrayal gnaw_at person 's heart . 
he grind his tooth together . 
i hate warsaw , he say to himself . 
i hate poland and all the goddamned mother ' son of them . 
all_of poland be a coffin . 
the terrible vision of the ghetto street flood his mind . 
what matter now ? 
what be beyond this fog ? 
only palestine , and i will never live to see palestine because i did not believe . 
by late afternoon the train inch into the marshaling yard in the railhead at location , which was fill with line of car poised to pour the tool of war to the russian front . 
at a siding , another train which be a familiar sight these day . 
deportee . 
jew . 
person 's skilled eye size_up them up . 
they be not pole . 
he guess by their appearance that they be rumanian . 
he walk toward the center of the city to keep his rendezvous with person . 
of all the place in poland , person hate location the most . 
the bathyrans were all go .

from the moment of the occupation location become a focal_point . 
he and person watch it carefully . 
location generally be the forerunner of what would happen elsewhere .

ice bath , electric_shock , lashing , wild_dog , testicle crusher . 
the group take_in ukrainian and group , and the einsatzkommandos wade knee-deep in blood and turn_into drunken , dope ridden maniac . 
location be their heart . 
in the spring of 1942 operation_reinhard begin in location . 
the ghetto , a miniature of location 's , was empty into the concentration_camp in the location suburb called location . 
as the concentration_camp empty , it was refill by a drain of the concentration_camp and town around location , then by deportee from outside poland . 
in and in and in they pour through the gate of location , but they never leave , and location was not grow any larger . 
what was happen in location ? 
be operation_reinhard the same pattern for the daily train now leave the location in warsaw ? 
was there another location in the warsaw area , as they suspect ?

we did n't have time to speak before person 's voice was screech at us from the bed . 
`` person meet person . 
exboyfriend meet ex-husband '' . 
she give the nasty laugh i ever hear . 
`` and do n't either of you forget that i'm not any man 's property . 
if you want_to fight , go down on the sidewalk '' . 
she was enjoy the situation . 
imagine that . 
person be a psychologist all_right . 
instead of wanting_to sock the poor bastard i find myself have a fellow_feeling for him . 
maybe he feel the same way . 
i never feel such a low-down hound in my life . 
first thing i know he be in the kitchenette cook_up the breakfast and i was hand person her coffee_cup and she was lie there handsome as a queen among her courtier . 
i could n't face person after that night . 
i did n't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone . 
i write her that i 'd meet_up_with person and that old bond had prove too strong and ask her to send my clothes down by express . 
of_course i had_to give her person 's address , but she never come_near us . 
all she do be write me a pleasant little note about how it be beautiful while it last but that now life had part our way and it was good-bye forever . 
she never say a word about the fifty dollar . 
she add a postscript beg me to be careful about drinking . 
i must know that that be my greatest weakness underline three time . 
afterwards i learn that person had call person on the telephone and make a big scene about person try to take_away her husband away . 
that finish me with person . 
trust person to squeeze all the drama out of a situation . 
and there i be shack_up with person in that filthy fourth floor attic on location . 
i use the phrase advisedly because there be something positively indecent about our relationship . 
i feel it and it eat_on me all_the_time , but i did n't know how right i be till later . 
what i did know be that person be always around . 
he sleep in the hall bedroom at the head of the stairs . 
`` who do you think pay the rent ? 
you would n't have me throw_out the poor boy out on the street '' , person say when i needle her about it . 
i say sure that be what i want her to do but she pay_attention no attention . 
person have a wonderful way of not listen to thing she did n't want_to hear . 
still i did n't think she was twotime me with person right then . 
to be on the safe side i never let person get_out of my sight day or night . 
person have me worried . 
i could n't make_out what his racket be . 
i 'd think him a pimp or procurer but he did n't seem to be . 
he be smooth and civil spoken but it seem to me there be something tough under his self-effacing manner . 
still he let person treat him like a valet . 
whenever the place was clean or a meal serve it was person who do the work . 
i never could find_out what his business be . 
he always seem to have money in his pocket . 
the phone had been disconnect but telegram come for him and note by special messenger . 
now_and_then he would disappear for several day . 
`` connection '' be all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when i put leading question . 
`` oh he 's just an international spy '' , person would shout with her screechy laugh . 
poor_devil he can n't have be too happy either . 
he get no relief from drink because , though sometimes person would buy himself a drink if he go out with us in the evening , he 'd leave it on the table untouched . 
when i be in liquor i ride him pretty hard i guess . 
occasionally if i push him too far he 'd give me a look out of narrowed eye and the hard cruel bony skull would show through that smooth face of his . 
`` someday '' , i tell person , `` that guy will kill us both '' . 
she just would n't listen . 
get drunk every_night be the only way i could handle the situation . 
person seem to feel the same way . 
we still have that much in_common . 
the trouble be drinking cost money . 
the way person and i were hit_it_up , we need ten or fifteen dollar an evening . 
person must have wheedle a_little out of person . 
i raise some kale by hock the good clothes i have left_over from my respectable uptown life , but when that be go i did n't have a cent . 
i do n't know what we would have do if person had n't come to town . 
person look_like a heavy person . 
he have the same bullethead of curly reddish hair but he did n't have person 's poker-faced humor or his brain or his charm . 
he be a big thick beefy violent man . 
now person may have be a lecher and a plug-ugly , but he be a good churchgoing catholic and he love his little_sister . 
those person have that irish clannishness that make them stick_together in_spite of politics and everything . 
person take_out person and me out to dinner at a swell steakhouse and tell us with tears in his eye how happy he be we had come together again . 
`` whom god hath join '' etcetera . 
the person be real religious people except for person . 
now it would be up_to me to keep the little girl out of mischief . 
person had been worry as hell ever since she 'd lose her job on that fashion magazine . 
it had go big with the location girl when he tell them his sister be an editor of art_and_apparel . 
how about me try to help her get_back her job back ? 
all evening person had be as demure as a little girl get ready for her first communion . 
it just_about blew us both out of the water when person suddenly come_out with what she come_out with . 
`` but brother i can n't take a job right now '' , she say with her eye on her ice_cream , `` i'm going_to have a baby , person 's baby , my own husband 's baby '' . 
my first thought be how had it happen so soon , but i count back on my finger and sure_enough we 'd been live together six week . 
person meanwhile was bubble_over with sentiment . 
greatest thing that ever happen . 
now person really would have_to settle_down to love honor and obey , and she 'd have_to quit drinking . 
he 'd come east for the christening , by_god he would . 
when we separate that evening person push a_hundred dollar_bill into person 's hand to help towards a layette . 
before he leave town person see_to_it that i was fix_up with a job . 
person have contact all_over the labor_movement . 
a friend of person 's named person had just muscle_into the group . 
the portwatcher be retired longshoreman and small-time seafarer off towboat and barge who act_as watchman on the wharf . 
most of them be elderly man . 
it be responsible and sometimes dangerous work because the thieving be awful in the port of location . 
they be n't as well pay as they should have been . 
one reason the portwatcher let person take_over them over be to get the protection of his muscleman . 
person need a front , some labor stiff with a clean record to act_as business_agent of the group local . 
there i be a retired group and structural ironworker who 'd never gouge a cent off a fellow_worker in my thirty years in the movement . 
for once radicalism be a recommendation . 
person could n't wait to get me hire . 
with my gray hair and my weather-beaten countenance i certainly look the honest working stiff . 
the thing a man will do for a woman . 
there be one fact which person could not overlook , one truth which he could not deny . 
as_long_as there be two human_being work together on the same project , there would be competition and you could no_more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave . 
no_matter how devoted a man be , no_matter how fully he give his life to the lord , he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that give him definition as an individual . 
all_of the job in the mission might be equal in the eye of the lord , but they be certainly not equal in the eye of the lord 's servant . 
it be only natural that person would strive for a position in which he could make the decision . 
even person himself be prey to this spirit of competition and he know it , not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church - his ambition for the bishopry had die very early in his career - but for the one clear victory he had talk_about to the colonel . 
he be not sure how much of this desire be_due to his devotion to the church and how much be his own ego , demand to be satisfy , for the two were intertwine and could not be separate . 
he want desperately to see person defeat , the communist in the village root_out , the mission stand triumphant , for in the triumph of the lord he himself would be triumphant , too . 
but perhaps this be a part of the eternal plan , that man 's ambition when link with god would be a driving_force , indefatigable force for good in the world . 
he sigh . 
how foolish it be to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith would suffice . 
he would have_to work without question the motive which make him work and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory , however it was bring_about , would be sweet indeed . 
his first move be to send person to the village to spend a_few day . 
his arm had been give him some trouble and person be not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it had heal improperly or whether person was simply rebel against the tedious work in the print_shop , use the stiffness in his arm as an excuse . 
in_any_event person send him to the local hospital to have it check , tell him to keep_his_ears_open while he be in the village to see if he could find_out what person was plan . 
person be elate at the prospect . 
he was allow to spend his night at an inn near the hospital and he was give some extra money to go_to the pachinko parlor - an excellent place to make contact with the enemy . 
he leave with all the joyous spirit of a child go on a holiday , nod attentively as person give him his final instruction . 
he was to get involved in no argument ; he was to try to make no convert ; he was simply to listen and report back what he hear . 
it be a ridiculous situation and person know it , for person , frankly partisan , openly gregarious , would make a poor espionage_agent . 
if he wanted to know anything , he would end_up ask about it point-blank , but in this guileless manner he would probably receive more truthful answer than if he try to get them by indirection . 
in all of his experience in the mission field person had never see a convert quite like person . 
from the moment that person had first walk into the mission to ask for a job , any job - his qualification neatly write on a piece_of_paper in a precise hand - he had be ready to become a christian . 
he had already been study the bible ; he know the fundamentals , and after study with person for a time he approach person , announce that he want to be baptize and that be that . 
person had never been able to find_out much about person 's past . 
person talk very little about himself except for the infrequent time when he use a personal illustration in connection with another subject . 
put the piece of this mosaic together , person have the vague outline of a biography . 
person be the fourth son of an elderly farmer who live on the coast , in location , and divide his life between the land and the sea , supplement the marginal livelihood on his small rent farm with seasonal employment on a fishing_boat . 
without exception person 's brother turn_to either one or both of their father 's occupation , but person show a talent for neither and instead spend most of his time on the beach where he repair net and prove immensely popular as a storyteller . 
he had go_into the japanese navy , had been train as an officer , had participate in one or two battle - he never go into detail regard his military experience - and at the age of twenty-five , quite as a bolt out_of_the_blue , he had walk into the mission as if he belong here and had become a christian . 
person be often curious ; often tempt to ask question but he never did . 
if and when person decide to tell him about his experience , he would do so unasked . 
person have no doubt that person would come_back from the village burst with information , ready to impart it with his customary gusto , liberally embellish with his active imagination . 
when the telephone ring on the day after person go down to the village , person have a hunch it would be person with some morsel of information too important to wait until his return , for there be few telephone in the village and the phone in person 's office rarely ring unless it be important . 
he be surprised to find person 's secretary on the other end of the line . 
he be even more startled when he hear what person want . 
the oyabun was entertain a group of dignitary , the secretary say , businessman from location for_the_most_part , and person wished to show them the mission . 
they had never see one before and had express a curiosity about it . 
`` oh '' ? 
person say . 
`` i guess it will be all_right . 
when would the oyabun like to bring his guest up_here '' ? 
`` this afternoon '' , the secretary say . 
`` at three o'clock if it will be of convenience to you at that time '' . 
`` all_right '' , person say . 
`` i will be expect them '' . 
he was about_to hang_up the phone , but a note of hesitancy in the secretary 's voice leave the conversation open . 
he have something more to say . 
`` i beg to inquire if the back be now safe for traveler '' , he say . 
person laugh despite himself . 
`` unless the oyabun has been work_on it '' , he say , then check himself and add : `` you can tell person that the back road be in very good_condition and will be quite safe for his party to use '' . 
`` arigato gosaimasu '' . 
the secretary sigh with relief and_then the telephone click in person 's hand . 
person have no idea why person want to visit the mission . 
for the oyabun to make such a trip be either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great confidence , and from all the available information it be probably the latter . 
person must feel fairly certain of his victory in_order to make a visit like this , a trip which could be so easily misinterpret by the people in the village . 
at_the_same_time , it be unlikely that any businessman would spend a day in a christian mission out_of mere curiosity . 
no , person was bring his associate here for a specific purpose and person would not be able to fathom it until they arrive . 
when he had give the call a_few moment thought , he go_into the kitchen to ask person to prepare tea and sushi for the visitor , use the formal english china and the silver tea_service which had been donate to the mission , then he go outside to inspect the grounds . 
person have a pile of cutting near one side of the lawn . 
person ask him to move it for_the_time_being ; he want the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless . 
a good initial impression would be important now . 
he go_into the print_shop , where person had just finish clean the press . 
`` how many pamphlet do we have in_stock '' ? 
person say . 
`` i should say about a_hundred_thousand '' , person say . 
`` why '' ? 
`` i would like to enact a little tableau this afternoon '' , person say , he explain about the visit and the effect he wish to create , the picture of a very busy mission . 
he did not wish to deceive person exactly , just to display the mission activity in a graphic and impressive manner . 
person nod as he listen to the instruction and say he would arrange the thing person request . 
person 's next stop be at the schoolroom , where person was monitor a test . 
he beckon to her from the door and she slip quietly outside . 
he tell her of the visitor and_then of his plan . 
`` how many child do you have present today '' ? he say . 
she look_back toward the schoolroom . 
`` fifteen '' , she say . 
`` no , only fourteen . 
the little person girl had_to go_home . 
she have a pretty bad cold '' . 
`` i would like them to appear very busy today , not busy exactly , but joyous , exuberant , full_of_life . 
i want to create the impression of a compound full of child . 
do you think you can manage it '' ? 
person smile . 
`` i 'll try '' . 
as person was walk back toward the residential hall , person come_out of the basement and bound up_to him . 
the altercation in the coffeehouse had do little to dampen his spirit , but he be still a_little wary around person for they had not_yet discuss the incident . 
`` i think i 've fix the pump so we won't have_to worry about it for a long_time '' , he say . 
`` i 've adjust the gauge so that the pump cut_out before the water get too low '' . 
`` fine '' , person say . 
he look out over the expanse of the compound . 
it was going_to take a_lot of activity to fill it . 
`` have you ever operate a transit '' ? he say . 
`` no , sir '' , person say . 
`` you are about_to become a first-class surveyor '' , person say . 
`` when person get_back with the jeep , i want you to round_up two or three japanese boy . 
person can help you . 
you 'll find an old transit in the basement . 
the glass be out_of it , but that won't matter . 
it look pretty efficient and that 's the important thing '' . 
he go_on to explain what he have_in_mind . 
person nod . 
he say he could do it . 
person was warm_to his overall strategy by the time he get_back to the residential hall . 
it be rather a childish game , all_in_all , but everybody seem to be get_into the spirit of the thing and he could not remember when he had enjoy plan anything quite so much . 
he be not sure what effect it would have , but that be really beside the point when you got right down to_it . 
he was not going_to lose the mission by default , and whatever reason person have for bring his little sightseeing group to the mission , he was going_to be in_for a surprise . 
he find person in the parlor and ask her to make sure everything be in_order in the residential hall , and_then to take_charge of the office while the party be here . 
when everything had been do , person go_back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly report until three o'clock . 
at two thirty he send person to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to keep_an_eye_on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpse the approach of person 's party . 
then person , attired in his best blue serge suit , sit in a chair out on the lawn , in the shade of a tree , smoke a cigarette and wait . 
the air be cool here , and the lacy pattern of the tree throw a dappled shadow on the grass , an effect which he find pleasant . 
she conclude by ask him to name another hour should this one be inconvenient . 
the fish take the bait . 
he reply that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meet with a stranger , but - joy of joy , he would be at home at the hour mention . 
but when she call he had think better of the matter and decide not to involve himself in a new entanglement . 
she was tell by the manservant who open the door that his lordship was engage on work from which he had leave strict order he was not to be disturb . 
person be bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff daunt her purpose . 
she write again and now , abandon for_the_moment the theme of love , she ask for help in the matter of her career . 
she could act and she could write . 
his lordship was concerned in the management of drury_lane but , if there be no opportunity there , would he read and criticize her novel ? 
at_last he consent to meet her , and following that brief interview person write him a yet more remarkable proposal : 
have you any objection to the following plan ? 
on thursday evening we may go_out of town together by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve mile . 
there we shall be free and unknown ; we can return the following morning . 
she conclude by ask for a brief interview - `` to settle with you where '' - and she throw_in a tribute to his `` gentle manners '' and `` the wild originality of your countenance '' . 
she open his reply with trembling finger . 
he agree ! 
and he would see her that evening . 
victory at_last ! 
at their meeting he tell her not to bother about `` where '' - he would attend to that . 
there be one of the new forte-piano in the room and , as person rise to go , he ask her to sing him one song before she leave . 
she sing him person 's charming ballad `` rosabelle '' , which be the vogue of the moment . 
she had never sing better . 
`` your voice be delightful '' , he approve with a warm smile . 
`` tomorrow will be a new experience - i have never before make_love to a nightingale . 
there have be cooing dove , chattering magpie , thieving jackdaw , a proud peacock , a silly goose , and a harpy_eagle - whom i be silly enough to mate with and who be now busy tear at my vitals '' . 
and so they go , he choose of all place an inn near medmenham_abbey , scene a generation ago of the obscene orgy of the hellfire_club . 
he regale person with an account of the mock mass perform by the cassocked blood , which he had have at firsthand from old person , one of the leader of the so-called `` order '' . 
each wear the monkish scourge at his waist but this , it seem , was not employ for self-flagellation . 
naked girl dance in the chancel of the abbey , the young and seemingly the most innocent being choose to read a sermon filled with veiled depravity . 
the jaded amorist conjure_up picture of the blasphemous rite with relish . 
alas , all that belong_to the age of `` devil_dashwood '' and `` wicked_wilkes '' , abbot and beadsman of the order ! 
the casual seduction of a seventeen year old bluestocking seem tame by comparison . 
they pass close by the turn to bishopsgate . 
a scant half_mile away person and person were doubtless sit on their diminutive terrace , the air about them scented with stock , and listen to the nightingale who had nest in the big lime_tree at the foot of the garden . 
charming and peaceful - but what be charm and peace compare to high adventure ? 
alone with the fabulous person ! 
how many woman had long for the privilege that be hers . 
how was she to behave , person wonder . 
to be passive , to be girlishly shy be palpably absurd . 
she be the pursuer as clearly as be person in shakespeare 's poem . 
and while her adonis did not suffer from inexperience , satiety might well be an equal handicap . 
no , she would not pretend modesty , but neither must she be crudely bold . 
mystery - that be the thing . 
in the bedroom she would insist on darkness . 
with his clubfoot he might well be grateful . 
at the inn , which be situated close to a broad weir , person was greet by the landlord with obsequious deference and address as `` milord '' . 
the place be evidently a familiar haunt and person wonder what other illicit love had been celebrate in the comfortable rooms to which they were show . 
the fire in the sitting_room be lighted . 
`` what about the bedroom '' ? 
person inquire . 
`` seem to me last time i be here the grate bellowed out smoke as it might have been prepare us for hell '' . 
`` we find some owl had build a nest in the chimney , milord , but i promise you you 'll never have trouble of that sort again '' . 
so , not_only had he be here before , but it seem he might well come again . 
person feel suddenly small and cheap , heroine of a trivial episode in the voluminous history of person . 
a cold supper was order and a bottle of port . 
when person 's ship had bear him to location , french wine had start to cross the location , the first shipment in a dozen war-ridden year , but the supplies had not_yet reach rural hostelry where the sweet wine of the spanish peninsula still rule . 
as they wait for supper they sit by the fire , glass in_hand , while person philosophize as much for his own entertainment as hers . 
`` sex be overpriced '' , he say . 
`` the great greek tragedy are concern with man against fate , not man against man for the prize of a woman 's body . 
so do n't see yourself as a heroine or fancy this little adventure be an event of major importance '' . 
`` the god seem to think sex pretty important '' , she rebut . 
`` mars and venus , bacchus and ariadne , jupiter and io , person and the nymph of the owl 's nest . 
that would be minerva , i suppose . 
be n't the owl her symbol '' ? 
person laugh . 
`` so you know something of the classics , do you '' ? 
`` tell me about minerva , how she behave , what she do to please you '' . 
`` i 'll tell you nothing . 
i do n't ask you who ' tis you 're be unfaithful to , husband or lover . 
frankly , i do n't care '' . 
for a moment she think_of answer with the truth but she know there be man who shy_away_from virginity , who demand some degree of education in body as_well_as mind . 
`` very_well '' , she say , `` i 'll not catechize you . 
what matter the others so_long_as i have my place in history '' . 
she was striking_the_right_note . 
no man ever have a better opinion of himself and indeed , with one so favor , flattery could hardly seem overdone . 
brain and beauty , high position in both the social and intellectual world , athlete , fabled lover - if ever the_world_was_any_man's_oyster it be his . 
the light supper over , person go to him and , slip an arm about his shoulder , sit on his knee . 
he draw her close and , hand on cheek , turn her face to his . 
her lip , moist and parted , speak his name . 
`` person '' ! 
his hand go to her shoulder and push_aside the knotted scarf that surmount the striped poplin gown ; then , to better purpose , he take_hold_of the knot and with dextrous finger , untie it . 
the bodice beneath be buttoned and , withdraw his lip from hers , he set her upright on his knee and start to undo it , unhurriedly as if she be a child . 
but , kindled by his kiss , his caressing hand , her desire be aflame . 
she spring up and go swiftly to the bedroom . 
person pour himself another glass of wine and hold it up to the candle_flame admire the rich color . 
he drink slowly with due appreciation . 
it be an excellent vintage . 
he rise and go to the bedroom . 
pause in the doorway he say : `` the form of the human female , unlike her mind and her spirit , be the most challenging loveliness in all nature '' . 
when person return to bishopsgate she long to tell them she had become person 's mistress . 
by odd coincidence , on the evening of her return person choose to read parisina , which be the latest of the titled poet 's success . 
as he declaim the sonorous measure , it was as_much_as person could do to restrain herself from burst_out with her dramatic tidings . 
`` although it be not the best of which he be capable '' , say person as he close the book , `` it be still poetry of a high order '' . 
`` if he would only leave the location '' , say person . 
`` i be tired_of sultan and scimitar '' . 
`` the hero of his next poem be person '' , say person , with slightly overdone carelessness . 
`` how do you know that '' ? demand person . 
`` i was tell it on_good_authority '' , person answer darkly . 
`` i must n't tell , i must n't tell '' , she repeat to herself . 
`` i promise him i would n't '' . 
winter come , and with it person 's baby - a boy as she had wish . 
person , he be called , in honor of the man who be at_once person 's pensioner and his most bitter detractor . 
with a pardonable irony person write to the father who had publicly disown his daughter : 
`` person and person will probably be glad to hear that person has safely recover from a very favorable confinement , and that her child be well '' . 
at_the_same_time another child - this one of person 's brain - was give to the world : alastor , a poem of pervading beauty in which the reader may gaze into the still depth of a fine mind 's musing . 
alastor was publish only to be savagely attack , contemptuously ignore . 
person send a copy to person , a former friend , and another to person . 
neither acknowledge the gift . 
only person 's praise sustain him in his disappointment . 
she understand completely . 
not a thought nor a cadence was miss in her summary of appreciation . 
`` you have make the labor worthwhile '' , he say to her , smiling . 
`` and in the future , since i write for a public of one , i can save the poor publisher from waste their money '' . 
`` a public of one '' , person echo reprovingly . 
`` how can you say such a thing ? 
there will be thousand who will thrill to the loveliness of alastor . 
there be some even now . 
what about that dear , clever person ? 
i be sure he be in rapture '' . 
`` poor person , he always has to be trot_out for my encouragement '' . 
`` there be other person . 
not everyone be bewitched by person 's caliph and harem beauty '' . 
person 's super critical attitude toward person had nothing to_do_with his moral disrepute . 
she be resentful of his easy success as compare with person 's failure . 
the same month that alastor was publish , murray sell twenty thousand copy of the_siege_of_corinth , a slovenly bit of byronism that even person 's generosity rebel at . 
the lordly poet be at low-water_mark . 
the careless writing be in keeping with his mood of savage discontent . 
on all side door were being slam in his face . 
the previous scandal , gaily divert as they be , had only serve to increase his popularity . 
now , under the impact of his wife 's disclosure , he was bring suddenly to the realization that there be a limit to tolerance , however brilliant , however far-famed the offender might be . 
he try defiance and openly flaunt his devotion to his half_sister , but he soon see , as did she , that this course if persist_in would involve them in a common ruin . 
for_the_moment there be no woman in his life , and it was this vacuum that had give person her opportunity . 
but the liaison successfully start in the last day of autumn was now languish . 
person , since the separation from his wife had been live in a smallish house in piccadilly_terrace . 
he refuse to bring person to it even as an occasional visitor , claim that his every move was watch by spy of the milbankes . 
person hand the pass to the colonel . 
he had think that the suggestion of take it himself would tip the colonel in the direction of serve his own order , but the slip_of_paper was fold and absently thrust into the colonel 's belt . 
despite his yearning , the colonel would not go_down to see the men come_through the line . 
he would remain in the tent , wait impatiently , occupy by some trivial task . 
- person . 
- sir ? 
- fetch me the copy of everything b and c company have requisition in the last six month . 
- the last six month , sir ? 
- you hear me . 
there 's a_lot of waste go_on here . 
it 's got_to stop . 
i want to take_a_look . 
this be no damn holiday , person . 
get busy . 
- yes , sir . 
person leave the tent . 
below he could see the bright torch light the riverbank . 
he glance back . 
the colonel crouch tensely on one of the folding_chair , methodically tear at his thumbnail . 
the bombproof be a low-ceilinged structure of heavy timber covered with earth . 
it stand some fifty pace from the edge of the bank . 
from the outside , it seem no more than a low drumlin , a lump on the dark earth . 
a crude ladder run down to a wooden floor . 
two slit enable observer to watch across the river . 
the place smell strongly of rank , fertile earth , rotting wood and urine . 
the plank floor was slime beneath person 's boot . 
at_least the union officer had been decent enough to provide a candle . 
there be no place to sit , but person walk slowly from the ladder to the window slit and back , stoop slightly to avoid strike his head on the heavy beam . 
in the corner be the soldier with the white_flag . 
he stand stiffly erect , clutch the staff , his body half hidden by the limp cloth . 
person hardly look at him . 
the man had come flounder aboard the flat-bottomed barge at the last instant , brandish the flag_of_truce . 
someone had haul him over the side , and he had remain silent while they cross . 
an officer with a squad of man had been wait on the bank . 
the man in the boat had start yell happily at first sight of the officer , two of them call him person . 
when the boat had touch , the weak ones and the two wounded man had been lift out and carry_away by the soldier . 
person had present his pouch and been lead to the bombproof . 
the officer had tell him that both list must be check . 
person had give his name and ask for a safe-conduct pass . 
the officer , surprised , say he would have to see . 
person had nod absently and mutter that he would check the list himself later . 
he had peer through the darkness at the rampart . 
the man he would take_back across the river stand there , but he turn_away from them . 
he want no part of the emotion of the exchange , no memory of the joy and gratitude that other man feel . 
he had hope to be alone in the bombproof , but the soldier had follow him . 
though person carefully ignore the man , he could not deny his presence . 
perhaps it would be better to speak_to him , since silence could not exorcise his form . 
person glance briefly at him , see only a body rigidly erect behind the languid banner . 
- we won't be too long . 
if my pass is approve , i may be a half-hour . 
the soldier answer in a curious , muffled voice , his lip barely move . 
person turn_away and did not see the man 's knee buckle and his body sag . 
- yes , sir . 
he had acknowledge the man . 
it was easy to think now , person decide . 
the stiff figure in the corner no_longer block his thought . 
he pace slowly , stoop , stare at the damp , slippery floor . 
he try to order the word of the three union officer , seek to create some coherent portrait of the dead boy . 
but he grope blindly . 
his lack of success steadily erode his interest . 
he stop pace , lean_against the dank , timbered wall and let his mind drift . 
a feeling of futility , an enervation of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever know , seep through him . 
what in_the_name_of_god was he do , crouch in a timbered pit on the wrong bank of the river ? 
why had he cross the dark water , to bring_back a group of reclaimed soldier or to skulk in a foul-smelling hole ? 
he grow annoyed and at_the_same_time surprised at that emotion . 
he be conscious of a growing sense of absurdity . 
person had write_out it all out , had n't he ? 
was n't the report official enough ? 
what did he hope to accomplish here ? 
person had order him not to leave the far bank . 
prompt by a guilty urge , he had disobey the order of a man he respect . 
for what ? 
to tell person something he would find_out for himself . 
the figure in the corner belch loudly , a deep , liquid eruption . 
person snort and_then laugh aloud . 
exactly ! 
the soldier 's voice be muffled again , stricken with chagrin . 
he clutch the staff , and his dark eye blink apologetically . 
- ' excuse me , sir . 
- let 's get_out of here . 
person run up the ladder and stand for a second suck_in the cool air that smell of mud and river weed . 
to his left , the two skiff dent their sharp bow into the soft bank . 
the flat-bottomed boat swing slowly to the pull of the current . 
a soldier hold the end of a frayed rope . 
three union guard appear , carry their rifle at ready . 
person stare at them curiously . 
they be stocky men , well-fed and clean-shaven , with neat uniform and sturdy boot . 
behind them shamble a long column of weak , tattered men . 
the thin gray figure raise a hoarse , caw cry like the call of a bird flock . 
they move toward the skiff with shocking eagerness , elbow and shove . 
four men were knock_down , but did not attempt to rise . 
they creep down the muddy slope toward the wait boat . 
the union soldier ground arms and settle into healthy , indifferent posture to watch the feeble boarding of the skiff . 
the crawl men try to rise and fall again . 
no_one move to them . 
person watch two of them flounder into the shallow water and listen to their voice beg shrilly . 
in a confused , soaked and stumbling shift of body and lift arm , the two man were drag into the same skiff . 
the third crawl man force himself erect . 
he sway like a drunkard , his arm mill in slow circle . 
he pace forward unsteadily , lean too far back , his head tilt oddly . 
his step be short and stiff , and , with his head throw_back , his progress be a supercilious strut . 
he appear to be peer haughtily down_his_nose at the crowded and unclean vessel that would carry him to freedom . 
he stalk into the water and fall heavily over the side of the flat-bottomed barge , his weight nearly swamp the craft . 
person look_for the fourth man . 
he had reach the three passive guard ; he creep in an incertain manner , pat the ground before him . 
the guard did not look at him . 
the figure on the earth halt , seemingly bewildered . 
he sink back on his thin haunch like a weary hound . 
then he begin to crawl again . 
person watch the creep figure . 
he feel a spectator interest . 
would the man make_it or not ? 
if only there be a clock for him to crawl against . 
if he fail to reach the riverbank in five minute , say , then the skiff would pull away and leave him grope in the mud . 
say three minute to make it sporting . 
still the guard did not move , but stand inert , aloof from the slow scramble man . 
the figure halt , and person gasp . 
the man begin to creep in the wrong direction , deceive by a slight rise in the ground ! 
he turn slowly and begin to crawl back up the bank toward the rampart . 
person race for him , his boot slam the soft earth . 
the guard came_to_life with astonishing menace . 
they spin and fling their rifle up . 
person gesticulate wildly . 
one man drop to his knee for better aim . 
- let me help him , for_the_love_of_god ! 
the guard lower their rifle and their rifle and peer at person with sullen , puzzled face . 
person pound to the crawl man and stop , pant heavily . 
he reach down and close his finger on the man 's upper arm . 
beneath his clutch , a flat strip of muscle surge on the bone . 
person bend awkwardly and lift the man to his foot . 
person stare into a cadaverous face . 
two clotted ball the color of mucus roll between fiery lid . 
light stick of finger , the tip gummy with dark earth , pat at person 's throat . 
the man 's voice be a sweet , patient whisper . 
- person say that he 'd take my arm and get me right there . 
but you ai_n't person . 
- no . 
- it do n't matter . 
be it far ? 
how far could it be , person think bleakly , how far can a blind_man crawl ? 
another body_length or all the rest of his nighted life ? 
- not far . 
- you talk deep . 
not like us fella . 
it raise the voice , bein in camp . 
you secesh ? 
- yes . 
come_on , now . 
can you walk ? 
- why , course i can . 
i can walk real good . 
person stumble down the bank . 
the man lean his frail body against person 's shoulder . 
he be no heavy than a child . 
person pause for breath . 
the man wheeze weakly , his fetid breath beat softly against person 's neck . 
his sweet whisper come after great effort . 
- oh , christ . 
i wish you be person . 
he promise to take me . 
- hush . 
we 're almost there . 
person support the man to the edge of the bank and pass the frail figure over the bow of the near skiff . 
the man sway on a thwart , turn his ruined eye from side to side . 
person turn_away , sicken for_the_first_time in many month . 
he hear the patient voice call . 
- person ? 
where be you , person ? 
- make him lie_down ! 
person snatch a deep breath . 
he had not mean to shout . 
he stand with his back to the skiff . 
the man mew and scratch , beg to be take_away . 
person speak bewilderedly to the dark night flecked with pine_knot torch . 
- goddamn you ! 
what do you do to them ? 
intelligence jab at him accusingly . 
he be angry , sicken . 
he had not feel that during the afternoon . 
no , nor later . 
all his emotion had be inward , self-conscious . 
in war , on a night like this , it was only the outward emotion that matter , what could be fling out into the darkness to damage others . 
yes . 
that be it . 
he be sure of_it . 
person 's type of man allow this sort of thing to happen . 
what a fool he had be to think_of his brother ! 
so person be dead . 
what did it matter ? 
his name had been cross_off a list . 
already his cool body lay in the ground . 
what word have any meaning ? 
what had he think_of , to go to person , grovel and beg understanding ? 
to confess with a canvas chair as a prie-dieu , gouge at his heart until a rough and stupid hand bid him rise and go ? 
man were slaughter every_day , tumble into eternity like so many torn parcel fling down a portable chute . 
what make him think person have a right to witness his brother 's humiliation ? 
what right have person to any special consideration ? 
was person better , more deserving ? 
to_hell_with person . 
let him chafe with_impatience to see person , rip open the note with trembling hand and read the formal report in person 's beautiful , schoolmaster 's hand . 
person would curse . 
he believe that brave boy did n't cry . 
person spit on the ground . 
he be grimly satisfy . 
he had stupidly think himself compel to ease his brother 's pain . 
now he know perfectly that he had but long to increase his own suffering . 
i would not want to be one of those writer who begin each morning by exclaim , `` o person , o person , o person and person , what would you have made_of a bomb_shelter ornament with four plaster_of_paris duck , a birdbath , and three composition gnome with long beard and red mobcap '' ? 
as i say , i would n't want to begin a day like this , but i often wonder what the dead would have do . 
but the shelter be as_much a part of my landscape as the beech and horse_chestnut tree that grow on the ridge . 
i can see it from this window where i write . 
it was build by the person , and stand on the acre of ground that adjoin our property . 
it bulk under a veil of thin , new grass , like some embarrassing fact of physicalness , and i think person set_out the statuary to soften its meaning . 
it would have be like her . 
she be a pale woman . 
sit on her terrace , sit in her parlor , sit anywhere , she ground_an_axe of self-esteem . 
offer her a cup of tea and she would say , `` why , these cup look_like just like a set i give to the group last year '' . 
show her the new swimming_pool and she would say , slap her ankle , `` i suppose this must be where you breed your gigantic mosquito '' . 
hand her a chair and she would say , `` why , it 's a nice imitation of those queen_anne chair i inherit from person '' . 
these trumps be more touching than they be anything else , and seem to imply that the night be long , her child ungrateful , and her marriage bewilderingly threadbare . 
twenty year ago , she would have been known as a golf_widow , and the sum of her manner be perhaps one of bereavement . 
she usually wear weeds , and a stranger watch her board a train might have guess that person be dead , but person be far from dead . 
he was march up_and_down the locker_room of the group shout , `` bomb cuba ! 
bomb berlin ! 
let 's throw a_little nuclear hardware at them and show them who 's boss '' . 
he be brigadier of the club 's locker_room light infantry , and at one time or another declare war on russia , czechoslovakia , yugoslavia , and china . 
it all begin on an autumn afternoon - and who , after all these century , can describe the fineness of an autumn day ? 
one might pretend never to have see one before , or , to more purpose , that there would never be another like it . 
the clear and searching sweep of sun on the lawn be like a climax of the year 's light . 
leaf were burn somewhere and the smoke smell , for all its ammoniac acidity , of beginning . 
the boundless blue_air was stretch over the zenith like the skin of a drum . 
leave her house one late afternoon , person stop to admire the october light . 
it be the day to canvass for infectious_hepatitis . 
person had been give sixteen name , a bundle of literature , and a printed book of receipt . 
it was her work to go among her neighbor and collect their check . 
her house stand on a rise of ground , and before she get_into her car she look at the house below . 
charity as she know it be complex and reciprocal , and almost every roof she see signify charity . 
person work for the brain . 
person did mental_health . 
person work for the blind . 
person be in_charge_of disease of the nose and throat . 
person was tuberculosis , person was mother ' march_of_dimes , person was cancer , and person do the kidney . 
person lead the birthcontrol league , person was arthritis , and way in the distance could be see the slate_roof of person 's house , a roof that signify gout . 
person undertake the work of go from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer . 
it be her destiny ; it be her life . 
her mother had done it before her , and even her old grandmother , who had collect money for smallpox and unwed mother . 
person had telephone most of her neighbor in_advance , and most of them be ready for her . 
she experience none of the suspense of some poor stranger sell encyclopedia . 
here_and_there she stay to visit and drink a glass of sherry . 
the contribution be ahead_of what she had get the previous year , and while the money , of_course , be not hers , it excite her to stuff her kit with big check . 
she stop at the person ' after dusk , and have a scotch_and_soda . 
she stay too late , and when she leave , it be dark and time to go_home and cook supper for her husband . 
`` i get a_hundred and sixty dollar for the hepatitis fund '' , she say excitedly when he walk in . 
`` i do everybody on my list but the person and the person . 
i want to get_in my kit in tomorrow morning - would you mind do them while i cook the dinner '' ? 
`` but i do n't know the person '' , person say . 
`` nobody does , but they give me ten last year '' . 
he be tired , he have his business worry , and the sight of his wife arrange porkchop in the broiler only seem like an extension of a boring day . 
he be happy enough to take the convertible and race up the hill to the person ' , think that they might give him a drink . 
but the person be away ; their maid give him an envelope with a check in it and shut the door . 
turn_in at the person ' driveway , he try to remember if he had ever meet them . 
the name encourage him , because he always feel that he could handle the_irish . 
there be a glass pane in the front_door , and through this he could see into a hallway where a plump woman with red hair was arrange flower . 
`` infectious_hepatitis '' , he shout heartily . 
she take_a_look a good look at herself in the mirror before she turn and , walk with very small step , start toward the door . 
`` oh , please come_in '' , she say . 
the girlish voice be nearly a whisper . 
she be not a girl , he could see . 
her hair was dye , and her bloom was fade , and she must have been crowd forty , but she seem to be one of those woman who cling_to the manners and grace of a pretty child of eight . 
`` your wife just call '' , she say , separate one word from another , exactly like a child . 
`` and i be not sure that i have any cash - any money , that_is - but if you will wait just a minute i will write you out a check if i can find my checkbook . 
wo n't you step into the living_room , where it be cozy '' ? 
a fire had just been light , he see , and thing had been set_out for drink , and , like any stray , his response to these comforts be instantaneous . 
where be person , he wonder . 
travel home on a late train ? 
change his clothes upstairs ? 
take a shower ? 
at the end of the room there be a desk heap with papers , and she begin to riffle these , make sigh and and noise of girlish exasperation . 
`` i be terribly sorry to keep_waiting you wait '' , she say , `` but won't you make yourself a little drink while you wait ? 
everything 's on the table '' . 
`` what train does person come_out on '' ? 
`` person be away '' , she say . 
her voice drop . 
`` person has be away for six week '' . 
`` i 'll have a drink , then , if you 'll have one with me '' . 
`` if you will promise to make it weak '' . 
`` sit_down '' , he say , `` and enjoy your drink and look_for your checkbook later . 
the only way to find thing be to relax '' . 
all_in_all , they have six drink . 
she describe herself and her circumstances unhesitatingly . 
person manufacture plastic tongue_depressor . 
he travel all_over the world . 
she did n't like to travel . 
plane make her feel faint , and in tokyo , where she had go that summer , she had been give raw fish for breakfast and so she had come straight home . 
she and her husband had formerly live in new_york , where she have many friend , but person think the country would be safe in_case_of war . 
she would rather live in danger than die of loneliness and boredom . 
she have no child ; she had make no friend . 
`` i 've see you , though , before '' , she say with enormous coyness , pat his knee . 
`` i 've see you walk your dog on sunday and drive by in the convertible '' . 
the thought of this lonely woman sit at her window touch him , although he was even more touch by her plumpness . 
sheer plumpness , he know , be not a vital part of the body and have no procreative function . 
it serve merely as an excess cushion for the rest of the carcass . 
and know its humble place in the scale of thing , why did he , at this time_of_life , seem almost ready to sell his soul for plumpness ? 
the remark she make about the suffering of a lonely woman seem so broad at_first that he did n't know what to make_of them , but after the sixth drink he put his arm around her and suggest that they go upstairs and look_for her checkbook there . 
`` i 've never do this before '' , she say later , when he was arrange himself to leave . 
her voice shake with feeling , and he think it lovely . 
he did n't doubt her truthfulness , although he had hear the words a_hundred_times . 
`` i 've never do this before '' , they always say , shake their dress down over their white shoulder . 
`` i 've never do this before '' , they always say , wait for the elevator in the hotel corridor . 
`` i 've never do this before '' , they always say , pour another whiskey . 
`` i 've never do this before '' , they always say , put_on their stocking . 
on ship at_sea , on railroad_train , in summer hotel with mountain view , they always say , `` i 've never do this before '' . 
`` where have you be '' ? 
person ask sadly , when he come_in . 
`` it 's after eleven '' . 
`` i have a drink with the person '' . 
`` she tell me he be in germany '' . 
`` he come home unexpectedly '' . 
person eat some supper in the kitchen and go_into the tv_room to hear the news . 
`` bomb them '' ! he shout . 
`` throw a_little nuclear hardware at them ! 
show them who be boss '' ! 
but in bed he have trouble sleep . 
he think_of first of his son and daughter , away at college . 
he love them . 
it be the only meaning of the word that he had ever know . 
then he play nine imaginary hole of golf , choose his handicap , his iron , his stance , his opponent , and his weather in_detail , but the green of the links seem fade in the light of his business worry . 
his money was tie_up in a nassau hotel , an ohio pottery works , and a detergent for window-washing , and luck had been run against him . 
his worry harry him up out of bed , and he light a cigarette and go to the window . 
in the starlight he could see the tree strip of their leaf . 
during the summer he had try to repair some of his losses at the track , and the bare tree remind him that his parimutuel ticket would still be lie , like leaf , in the gutter near location and location . 
maple and ash , beech and elm , one_hundred to win on three in the fourth , fifty to win on six in the third , one_hundred to win on two in the eighth . 
child walk home from school would scuff through what seem to be his foliage . 
then , get_back into bed , he think_of unashamedly of person , plan where they would next meet and what they would do . 
there be , he think , so few true means of forgetfulness in this life that why should he shun the medicine even when the medicine seem , as it did , a_little crude ? 
it was not as_though she note clearly that her nephew had not been to see her for ten year , not since their last journey eastward to witness their person being lower into the rocky soil ; that aside from due notification of certain major event in their life ( two marriage , two birth , one divorce ) , christmas_card and easter_card of the traditional sort had be the only thin link she have with them through the widowed year . 
her thought be not discrete . 
but there be a look about her mouth as_though she were taste lemon . 
she grasp the chair arm and bring her thin body upright , like a bird alert for flight . 
she turn and walk stiffly into the parlor to the dainty legged escritoire , warp and cracked now from fifty year in an atmosphere of sea_spray . 
there she extract two limp vellum sheet and write_off the letter , one to person , one to person . 
once her trembling hand , with the pen grasp tight in it , was press against the paper the word come sharply , smoothly , as authoritatively as they would drop from her own lip . 
and the stiffly regal look of them , she see grimly , lack the quaver of age which , thwart the effort of her amazing will , run through her spoken_word like a thin ragged string . 
`` please come_down as_soon_as you conveniently can '' , the upright letter stalked from the broad nibbed pen , `` i have an important matter to discuss with you '' . 
to person : 
`` i be afraid there be not much to amuse small child here . 
i should be oblige if you could make other arrangement for your daughter . 
you may stay as long as you wish , of_course , but if arrange for the care of the girl must take_into_account time into_account , i think a day or two should be enough to finish our business in '' . 
to person : `` please give my regard to person '' . 
she sign the letter quickly , stamp them , and place them on the hall table for person to mail in town . 
then she go_back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjust her eye to the glare on the water . 
`` my nephew will be come_down '' , she say that evening as person bring her dinner into the dining_room , the whole meal on a vast linen covered tray . 
she look at the girl speculatively from eye which had pale with the years ; from the early evening light of them which had first startle person to look at her in an uncousinly way , they had fade to a near absence of color which have , possibly from her constant looking_at the water , something of the light of the sea in them . 
person place the tray on the table and with a flick of dark wrist draw_off the cloth . 
she smile , and the tooth gleam in her beautifully modeled olive face . 
`` that will be so nice for you , person '' , she say . 
her voice be ripe and full and her tooth flash again in sicilian brilliance before the warm curved lip meet and her mouth settle in repose . 
`` um '' , say the old lady , and bring her eye down to the tray . 
`` you remember them , i suppose '' ? 
she glint suspiciously at the dish before her : `` blowfish . 
i hope person buy them whole '' . 
person step back , her eye roam the tray for omission . 
then she look at the old_woman again , her eye calm . 
`` yes '' , she say , `` i remember that they come here every summer . 
i used_to play with the older one sometimes , when he 'd let me . 
person '' ? 
the name fell with lazy affectionate remembrance from her lip . 
for an instant the old aunt feel something indefinable flash through her smile . 
she would have say triumph . 
then person turn and with an easy grace walk toward the kitchen . 
person lift her head and follow the retreating figure , her eye rest nearly close on the unselfconscious rise and fall of the rounded hip . 
for a moment she hold her face to the empty doorway ; then she snort and grope_for her fork . 
there 's no great catastrophe in the universe , she reflect dourly , impale tender green_bean on the silver fork , than the dwindling_away of a family . 
procreation , expansion , proliferation - these be the law of living_thing , with the penalty for not obey them the ultimate in punishment : oblivion . 
when the fate of the individual is visit on the group , then ( the warm sweet butter drip from her raised trembling fork and she push her head forward belligerently ) , ah , then the true bitterness of existence could be taste . 
and indeed the young garden bean be brackish in her mouth . 
she be the last living of the older generation . 
what had once be a widespread family - at one time , she know , there be enough person to populate an entire county - had now narrow_down to the two boy , person and person . 
she swing her eye up to the blue of the window , her jaw gently mash the bitter bean . 
what hope lie_in the nephew , she ask the intensifying light out there , with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced , having sire two girl child , with none to bear_on the person name ? 
she eat . 
it seem to her , as it seem each night , that the gloom draw_in itself in and become dense at the table 's empty chair , give her the frequent illusion that she dine with shadow . 
here , too , she talk low , quirk her head at one or another of the place , most often at person 's armchair which face her across the long table . 
or it might have been the absent nephew she address , consciously play with the notion that this be one of the summer of their early years . 
she think_of again of her child , those two who had die young , before the later science which might have save them could attach even a label to their separate malignancy . 
the girl , her first , she barely remember . 
it could have be anyone 's infant , for it had not survive the bassinet . 
but the boy , the boy had be alive yesterday . 
each successive movement in his growing was record on the unreeling film inside her . 
he run on his plump sticks of leg , freeze now_and_again into the sudden startled attitude which the camera had catch and hold_on the paling photograph , all carefully place and glue and label , rest in the fat plush album in the bottom drawer of the escritoire . 
in the cruel clearness of her memory the boy remain unchanged , quick with the delight of laughter , and the pain with which she recall that short destroyed childhood be still unendurable to her . 
it be one with the desolate rock and the alien water on those day when she hate the sea . 
the brother drive down together in person 's small red sports_car , person at_the_wheel . 
they rarely speak . 
person sit and regard the farm country which , spread_out from both side of the road , roll greenly up to where the silent white house and long barn and silo nest into the tilled field . 
he see the land with a stranger 's eye , all the old familiarness go . 
and it present itself to him as it would to any stranger , impervious , complete in itself . 
there be stability there , too - a color which his life had have once . 
that is what childhood be , he tell himself . 
solid , settle , lose . 
in the stiff neutral line of the telephone_pole he see the no-nonsense pen stroke of person 's letter . 
what bad grace , what incredible selfishness he and person had show . 
the boyhood summer preceding their uncle 's funeral might never have be . 
they had close over , absolutely , with the sealing of old person 's grave . 
the small car fly_on relentlessly . 
the old_woman , stubbornly reign in the house above the crash water take_on an ominous reality . 
person move and adjust his long leg . 
`` i suppose it has to do with the property '' , person had say over the telephone when they had discuss their receipt of the letter . 
not until the word had been speak did person suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea , and feel his contrition blot_out in one shameful moment of covetousness . 
he and person be the last of the family , and there lie the location property which had seem to have no_end , stretch from horizon to horizon , in those golden day of summer . 
now person turn his head to look at his brother . 
person hold the wheel loosely , but his finger curve around it in a purposeful way and the deliberate set of his body speak plainly of the figure he 'd make in the years to come . 
his sandy hair was already begin to thin and recede at the side , and person look_away quickly away . 
person easily look years old than himself , settled , his world comfortably categorized . 
the vacation traffic was become heavy as they approach the sea . 
`` she did n't mention bring person '' , person say , maneuver the car into the next lane . 
`` she 's probably get old - crotchety , i mean - and we figure uh-uh , better not . 
they 've never meet , you_know . 
but person would n't budge without an express invitation . 
i feel kind_of bad about it '' . 
he give person a quick glance and move close to the wheel , hug it to him , and person catch this brief of allusion to guilt . 
`` i imagine the old girl have n't miss us much '' , location add , his eye on the road . 
person ignore the half expressed bid for confirmation . 
he smile . 
it be barely possible that his brother be right . 
he could tell they were approach the sea . 
the air take_on a special strength now that they 'd leave_behind the fecund warmth of the farmland behind . 
there be the smell of the coast , like a primeval memory , compose of equal part saltwater , clam , seaweed and northern air . 
he turn from the fly_by tree to look ahead and see with an inward boy 's eye again the great fieldstone house which , build on one of the many acre of ancestral land bordering the west harbor , had be person 's bride-gift to his cousin wife as the last century end . 
person 's thought must have been keep silent pace beside his own , climb the same crag in dirty white sneaker , clamber out on top of the headland and come_upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant . 
`` remember the starbird ? '' 
person ask , and person lift his eye from the double line in the middle of the road , the twin white ribbon which the car swallow rapidly as it ascend the crest of the hill and come_down . 
`` the_starbird , '' person say . 
there be the day person had , in an unexpected grandiose gesture , hand_over the pretty sloop to person for_keeps , on_condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever the younger boy wish . 
the two of them had develop into a remarkable sailing team . 
all_of this happen in a time of their life when their youth and their brotherhood knit them together as no other time or circumstance could . 
they seem then to have have a single mind and body , a mutuality which had been accept with the fact of their youth , casually . 
he see the starbird as she lie , her slender mast up and gently turn , its point describe constant languid circle against a cumulus sky . 
both of them had know the feeling of the small life in her wait , ready , for the two of them to run_up her sail . 
the starbird had be long at the bottom of the bay . 
they come unexpectedly upon the sea . 
meet it without preparation as they did , rob of anticipation , a common disappointment seize them . 
they were climb the hill in the night when the headlight abruptly probe solid blackness , become two parallel luminous tube which broaden out into a faint mist of light and end . 
person stop the car and switch_off the light and they sit looking_at the water , which , there be no moon out , at_first could be distinguish from the sky only by an absence of star . 
his eye be old and they never see well , but heat with whisky they 'd glare at my noise , grow red and raise_up his rage . 
i decide i hate the person kid too , die in our kitchen while i be away where i could n't watch , die just to entertain person and make me go_up snap steps and down a drafty hall , pa lump under the cover at the end like dung cover with snow , snore and whistle . 
oh he 'd not care about the person kid . 
he 'd not care about getting wake so he could give_up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding_place in_the_bargain . 
that would make him mad enough if he be sober . 
i did n't hurry though it was cold and the person kid be in the kitchen . 
he be all shoveled_up like i think he 'd be . 
i push at his shoulder , call his name . 
i think his name stop the snoring but he did n't move except to roll a_little when i shove him . 
the cover slide down his skinny neck so i see his head , fuzzed like a dandelion go to seed , but his face was turn to the wall - there be the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster - and i think , well you do n't look_like much like a pig-drunk bully now . 
i could n't be sure he be still asleep . 
he be a cagey sonofabitch . 
i shake him a_little hard and make_noise some noise . 
`` pap-pap-pap-hey '' , i say . 
i was lean too far over . 
i know better . 
he always sleep close_to the wall so you had to lean to reach him . 
oh he be smart . 
it put_off you off . 
i know better but i was think_of the person kid mother-naked in all that dough . 
when his arm come_up i duck away but it catch me on the side of the neck , water my eye , and i back_off to cough . 
person be on his side , look at me , his eye wink , the hand that had hit me a fist in the pillow . 
`` get_out the hell out of here '' . 
i did n't say anything , try to get my throat clear , but i watch him . 
he be like a mean horse to come at from the rear . 
it be better , though , he 'd hit me . 
he be bitter when he miss . 
`` get_out the hell out of here '' . 
`` person send me . 
he tell me to wake you '' . 
`` a fat hell on person . 
get_out of here '' . 
`` he find the person kid by the crib '' . 
`` get_out the hell out '' . 
pa pull at the cover . 
he was taste his mouth . 
`` the kid 's freeze good . 
person is rub him with snow . 
he 's get him in the kitchen '' . 
`` person '' ? 
`` no , pa . 
it 's the person kid . 
the kid '' . 
`` nothing to steal from the crib '' . 
`` not steal , pa . 
he was just lie there . 
person find him freeze . 
that 's where he be when person find him '' . 
pa laugh . 
`` i ai n't hide nothing in the crib '' . 
`` you do n't understand , pa . 
the person kid . 
the kid '' - 
`` i god_damn well understand '' . 
pa had his head up , glare , his tooth gnaw at the place where he 'd grow a mustache once . 
`` i god_damn well understand . 
you know i do n't want to see person . 
that cock . 
why should i ? 
what did he come for , hey ? 
god_dammit , get . 
and do n't come_back . 
find_out something . 
you 're a fool . 
both you and person . 
person . 
that cock . 
do n't come_back . 
out . 
out '' . 
he was shout and breathe hard and close his fist on the pillow . 
he have long black hair on his wrist . 
they curl around the cuff of his nightshirt . 
`` person make me come . 
person say '' - 
`` a fat_hell on person . 
he 's an even bigger fool than you be . 
fat , hey ? 
i teach him , dammit , and i 'll teach you . 
out . 
you want me to drop my pot '' ? 
he was_about_to get_up so i get_out , slam the door . 
he was begin to see he be too mad to sleep . 
then he throw thing . 
once he go_after person and dump his pot over the banister . 
pa 'd be shit sick in that pot . 
person get an axe . 
he did n't even bother to wipe_off himself off and he chop_down part of pa 's door down before he stop . 
he might not have gone_that_far if pa had n't been lock in laugh fit to shake the house . 
that pot put pa in an awful good_humor whenever he think_of it . 
i always feel the memory be present in both of them , stir in their chest like a laugh or a growl , as eager as an animal to be out . 
i hear pa curse all_the_way downstairs . 
person had lay steaming towel over the kid 's chest and stomach . 
he was rub snow on the kid 's leg and foot . 
water from the snow and water from the towel had run off the kid to the table where the dough be , and the dough was turn pasty , stick_to the kid 's back and behind . 
`` ai n't he going_to wake_up '' ? 
`` what about your person '' ? 
`` he be awake when i leave '' . 
`` what 'd he say ? 
did you get the whisky '' ? 
`` he say a fat_hell on person '' . 
`` do n't be smart . 
did you ask him about the whisky '' ? 
`` yeah '' . 
`` well '' ? 
`` he say a fat_hell on person '' . 
`` do n't be smart . 
what 's he go_to do '' ? 
`` go_back to sleep most likely '' . 
`` you 'd best get that whisky '' . 
`` you go . 
take the axe . 
pa 's scare to hell of axe '' . 
`` listen to me , person , i 've have enough to your sassing . 
this kid 's freeze bad . 
if i do n't get some whisky down him he might die . 
you want the kid to die ? 
do you ? 
well , get your pa and get that whisky '' . 
`` pa do n't care about the kid '' . 
`` person '' . 
`` well he do n't . 
he do n't care at_all , and i do n't care to get my head bust neither . 
he do n't care , and i do n't care to have his shit fling on me . 
he do n't care about anybody . 
all he care about be his whisky and that dry crack in his face . 
get pig-drunk - that 's what he want . 
he do n't care about nothing else at_all . 
nothing . 
not person 's kid neither . 
that cock . 
not the kid neither '' . 
`` i 'll get the spirits '' , ma say . 
i 'd wind_up person up tight . 
i be ready to jump but when ma say she 'd get the whisky it surprise him like it surprise me , and he run_down . 
ma never go near the old_man when he was sleep_off . 
not anymore . 
not for year . 
the first thing every morning when she wash her face she could see the scar on her chin where he 'd cut her with a boot cleat , and maybe she see him heave it again , the dirty sock pop_out as it fly . 
it should have be nearly as easy for her to remember that as it be for person to remember go_after the axe while he was still spatter with pa 's yellow sick inside . 
`` no you won't '' , person say . 
`` yes , person , if they 're need '' , ma say . 
person shake his head but neither of us try to stop her . 
if we had , then one of us would have had to go instead . 
person rub the kid with more snow & & & rub & & & rub . 
`` i 'll get more snow '' , i say . 
i take the pail and shovel and go_out on the porch . 
i do n't know where ma go . 
i think she 'd go upstairs and expect to hear she had . 
she had surprise person like she had surprise me when she say she 'd go , and_then she surprise him again when she come_back so quick like she must have , because when i come_in with the snow she be there with a bottle with three white feather on its label and person was hold it angrily by the throat . 
oh , he was be queer and careful , paw about in the drawer and hold the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm . 
he be awful angry because he 'd think ma was going_to do something big , something heroic even , especially for her . 
i know him . 
i know him . 
we feel the same sometimes , while ma was n't think_about that at_all , not anything like that . 
there be no way of get_even . 
it be n't like getting cheat at the fair . 
they were always try so you got_to expect it . 
now person had give ma something of his - we both had when we think she was go straight to pa - something valuable ; but since she did n't know we 'd give it to her , there be no easy way of get_back it back . 
person cut the foil off finally and unscrew the cap . 
he was put_out too because there be only one way of understand what she 'd done . 
ma had find one of pa 's hiding_place . 
she 'd find one and she had n't say a word while person and i had hunt and hunt as we always did all winter , every winter since the spring that person had come and i had look in the privy and find the first one . 
pa have a knack for hiding . 
he know we were look and he enjoy it . 
but now ma . 
she 'd find it by_luck most likely but she had n't say anything and we did n't know how long_ago it 'd be or how many other ones she 'd find , say nothing . 
pa be sure to find_out . 
sometimes he did n't seem to because he hide them so well he could n't find them himself or because he look and do n't find anything and figure he had n't hide one after_all or had drink_up it up . 
but he 'd find_out about this one because we were use it . 
a fool could see what was go_on . 
if he find_out ma find it - that 'd be bad . 
he take_pride in his hiding . 
it be all the pride he have . 
i guess fool person and me take doing . 
but he did n't figure ma for much . 
he did n't figure her at_all , and if he find_out * * h a woman * * h it 'd be bad . 
person pour some in a tumbler . 
`` you going_to put more towel on him '' ? 
`` no '' . 
`` why not ? 
that 's what he need , something warm to his skin , do n't he '' ? 
`` not where he 's freeze good . 
heat 's bad for frostbite . 
that 's why i only put towel on his chest and belly . 
he 's_got to thaw slow . 
you ought to know that '' . 
color on the towel had run . 
ma poke her toe in the kid 's clothes . 
`` what are we going_to do with these '' ? 
person begin pour whisky in the kid 's mouth but his mouth fill without any get down his throat and in a second it was drip from his chin . 
`` here , help me prop_up him up . 
i got_hold his mouth open '' . 
i did n't want to touch him and i hope ma would do it but she keep look at the kid 's clothes pile on the floor and the pool of water by them and did n't make any move to . 
`` come_on , person '' . 
`` all_right '' . 
`` lift , do n't shove * * h lift '' . 
`` ok , i'm lift '' . 
i take him by the shoulder . 
his head flop back . 
his mouth fall_open . 
the skin on his neck be tight . 
he be cold all_right . 
`` hold_up his head up . 
he 'll choke '' . 
`` his mouth be open '' . 
`` his throat 's shut . 
he 'll choke '' . 
`` he 'll choke anyway '' . 
`` hold_up his head up '' . 
`` i can n't '' . 
`` do n't hold him like that . 
put your arm around him '' . 
`` well_jesus '' . 
he be cold all_right . 
i put my arm carefully around him . 
person have his finger in the kid 's mouth . 
`` now he 'll choke for_sure '' . 
`` shut_up . 
just hold him like i tell you '' . 
he be cold all_right , and wet . 
i had my arm behind his back . 
he be in his mid-fifties at this time , long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionize yet once_again , and it was almost a decade since he had swear_off lecturing . 
there was never a doubt anymore how his structure would be receive ; it was always the same unqualified success now . 
he could no_longer build anything , whether a private residence in his pennsylvania county or a church in brazil , without it be obvious that he had do it , and while here_and_there he was taken_to_task for again develop the same airy technique , they be such fanciful and sometimes even playful building that the public feel assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once establish by an artist as his private vision , be no_longer disputable as to its other value . 
person be internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine americana in foreign eye , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was make even more believably sincere by his personality . 
he had live for almost thirty year in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; he rise at half past six every morning , make himself some french coffee , have his corn_flake and more coffee , smoke four cigarette while read last sunday 's herald_tribune and yesterday 's pittsburgh_gazette , then put_on his high-topped farmer 's shoe and walk under a vine bower to his workshop . 
this be an enormously long building whose wall were make of rock , some of them bring home from every continent during his six year as an oil_geologist . 
the debris of his other career was pile everywhere ; a pile of wire cage for mouse from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lie on its side on the windowsill , vertical steel column wire for support to the open ceiling beam with spidery steel cantilever jut_out into the air , masonry construction on the floor from the time he was invent his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass_through a whole house , visible all_the_way up through wire grating on each floor . 
his file , desk , drafting_board and a high stool form the only clean island in the chaos . 
everywhere else his idea lie or hang in visible form : his model , drawing , ten foot canvas in monochrome from his painting day , and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed book that look as_though their inside had been ransack by a maniac . 
bicycle gearset he had once use as the basis of the design for the group plant hang on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hat , be a clean pair of roller_skate which he occasionally use up_and_down front of his house . 
he work stand , with his left hand in his pocket as_though he were merely stop for a moment , sketch with the surprised stare of one who was watch another person 's hand . 
sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him , sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil do what he disapprove . 
it all seem - if one could have peek in at him through one of his window - as_though this broken nosed man with the muscular arm and wrestler 's neck be merely the caretaker try his hand at the boss 's work . 
this air of disengagement carry_over to his apparent attitude toward his things , and people often mistake it for boredom in him or a surrender to repetitious routine . 
but he be not bored at_all ; he had find his style quite early in his career and he think it quite wonderful that the world admire it , and he could not imagine why he should alter it . 
there are , after_all , fortunate soul who hear everything , but only know how to listen to what be good for them , and person be , as thing go , a fortunate man . 
he leave his home the day after new_year's_day 's wear a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and without a hat . 
he would wear this same costume in florida , despite his wife person 's reminder over the past five day that he must take some cool clothes with him . 
but he be too busy to hear what she was say . 
so they part when she be in an impatient humor . 
when he was bend over behind the wheel of the station_wagon , feel in his trouser_cuff for the ignition_key which he had drop a moment before , she come_out of the house with an enormous rumanian shawl over her head , which she had buy in that country during one of their trip abroad , and hand him a clean handkerchief through the window . 
find the key under his shoe , he start the engine , and while it warm_up he turn to her stand there in the dripping fog , and say , `` defrost the refrigerator '' . 
he see the surprise in her face , and laugh as_though it be the funny expression he had ever see . 
he keep_on laugh until she start laugh with him . 
he have a deep voice which be full of good food she had cook , and good_humor ; an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it . 
he would settle himself into his seat to laugh . 
whenever he laugh it be all he was do . 
and she was make to fall_in_love with him again there in the rutted dirt driveway stand in the cold fog , mad as she be at his going_away when he really did n't have to , mad at their both get old in a life that seem to have take no more than a week to go_by . 
she be forty-nine at this time , a lanky woman of breeding with an austere , narrow face which have the distinction of a steeple or some architecture that had been design long_ago for a stubborn sort of prayer . 
her eyebrow be definite and heavy and form two line move upward toward a high forehead and a great head_of_hair of brown hair that fall to her shoulder . 
there be an air of blindness in her gray eye , the startled horse look that ultimately come to some woman who be_born at the end of an ancestral line long_since divorce from moneymaking and which , besides , has keep its estate intact . 
she be personally sloppy , and when she have cold would blow her nose in the same handkerchief all day and keep it , soak wet , dangle from her waist , and when she garden she would eat dinner with dirt on her calf . 
but just when she seem to have sink into some depravity of peasanthood she would disappear and come_down bathe , brush , and take_a_breath of air , and even with her broken nail her hand would come to rest on a table or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy , a grace of history , so_to_speak , and for an instant one see how ferociously proud she be and adamant on certain question of personal value . 
she even speak differently when she be clean , and she be clean now for his departure and her voice clear and rather sharp . 
`` now drive carefully , for_god's_sake '' ! she call , try to attain a half humorous resentment at his departure . 
but he did not notice , and was already back the car down to the road , say `` toot-toot '' ! to the stump of a tree as he pass it , the same stump which had impale the car of many_a guest in the past thirty year and which he refuse to have remove . 
she stand clutch her shawl around her shoulder until he had swing the car onto the road . 
then , when he had it point down the hill , he stop to gaze at her through the window . 
she had begin to turn_back toward the house , but his look catch her and she stand_still , wait there for what his expression indicate would be a serious word_of_farewell . 
he look at her out of himself , she think , as he did only for an instant at_a_time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellow a_little and his breath come hard through his nicotine choked lung , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly find herself stare at in the group on a thursday once . 
now she keep herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure_enough he point at her with his index_finger and say `` toot '' ! once_more and roar_off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it press the accelerator , just as his hand did when he work . 
she walk back to the house and enter , feel herself return , sensing some kind of opportunity in the empty building . 
there be a death in all parting , she know , and promptly put it out of her mind . 
she enjoy great party when she would sit_up talk and dance and drink all night , but it always seem to her that be alone , especially alone in her house , be the real part of life . 
now she could let out the three parakeet without_fear they would be step_on or that person would let them out one of the door ; she could dust the plant , then break_off suddenly and pick_up an old novel and read from the middle on ; improvise cha-cha on the harp ; and finally , the best part of all , simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine and the newspaper , read the ad as_well_as the news , register nothing on her mind but let her soul suspend itself above all wishing and desire . 
she do this now , comfortably aware of the mist run down the window , of the silence outside , of the dark afternoon it was get_to be . 
she fall_asleep lean_on her hand , hear the house creak as_though it be a live a private life of its own these two hundred year , hear the bird rustle in their cage and the occasional whirring of wing as one of them land on the table and walk across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm . 
every few minute she would awaken for a moment to review thing : person , yes , was on his way south , and the two boy be away in school , and nothing was burn on the stove , and person was come for dinner and bring three guest of hers . 
then she fall_asleep again as suddenly as a person with fever , and when she awake it be dark outside and the clarity be back in her eye . 
she stand_up , smooth her hair down , straighten her clothes , feel a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of person come_in or go_out , and yet , now that she was begin to cook , she glimpse a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain make her head writhe , and in_a_moment she find it hard to wait for person to come with her guest . 
she go_into the living_room and turn_on three lamp , then back into the kitchen where she turn_on the ceiling light and the switch that light the flood on the barn , illuminate the driveway . 
she know she was feel afraid and inwardly laugh at herself . 
they be both so young , after_all , so unready for any final parting . 
how could it have be thirty year already , she wonder ? 
but yes , nineteen plus thirty be forty-nine , and she be forty-nine and she had been marry at nineteen . 
she stand_still over the leg_of_lamb , rub herb into it , quite suddenly conscious of a nausea in her stomach and a feeling of wrath , a sensation of violence that start her shivering . 
but they all say , `` no , your time will come . 
enjoy be a bride while you can '' . 
there be no room for company in the tiny weaning_house ( where the person boy always take their bride , till they could get a house and a farm of their own ) . 
so when the big_house fill_up and run_over , the sister-in-law find bed for everyone in their own home . 
and there be still not anything that person could do . 
so person give_up ask , and accept her reprieve . 
without say so , she be really grateful ; for to attend the dying be something she had never experience , and certainly had not imagine when she think_of the duty she would have as person 's wife . 
she had make curtain for all the window of her little house , and she had keep it spotless and neat , shabby as it be , and cook good meal for person . 
she had do all the thing she had promise herself she would do , but she had not think_of this . 
people die , she would have say , in hospital , or in car on the highway at night . 
person be gone all day now , not come_in for dinner and sometimes not for supper . 
when they first marry he had been work in the field all day , and she would get_in the car and drive to wherever he was work , to take him a fresh hot meal . 
now there be no work in the field , nor would there be till it rain , and she did not know where he go . 
not that she complain , or have any cause to . 
four or five of the cousin from location be about his age , so naturally they run_around together . 
there be no reason for her to ask what they do . 
thus a new pattern of day begin to develop , for person did not die . 
she lie still on the bed , her head hardly dent the pillow ; sometimes she open her eye and look_around , and sometimes she take a_little milk or soup . 
they stop expect her to die the next minute , but only in the next day or two . 
those who had drive hundred of mile for the burial would not go_home , for she might die any time ; but they might as_well unpack their suitcase , for she might linger on . 
so the pattern was establish . 
when person had put_up her breakfast dish and mop her linoleum rug , she would go_to the big_house . 
there be not anything she could do there , but that be where everyone be , or would be . 
person and the boy would come_by , say `` how 's granny '' ? and sit on the porch a while . 
the older man would be there at noon , and maybe rest for a time before they take their gun off to the creek or drive down the road towards town . 
the woman and child stay_at the person ' . 
the woman , keep their voice low as they work around the house or sit in the living_room , sound like chicken shut_up in a coop for the night . 
the child had to play away from the house ( in the barn loft or the pasture behind the barn ) , to maintain a proper quietness . 
off_and_on , all day , someone would be wipe at the powdery gray dust that settle over everything . 
the evaporative_cooler had been move to granny 's room , and her door was keep shut ; so that the rest of the house stay open , though there be a question as to whether it be hot or cool that way . 
the dust clog their throat , and the heat parch them , so that the woman be always make ice_water . 
they had clean_up an old icebox and begin to buy fifty pound block of ice in town , as the electric_refrigerator come_near nowhere near provide enough ice for the crowd who eat and drink there . 
one afternoon , as the woman sit cluck softly , a new carload of people pull_up at the gate . 
it be a cadillac , black grayed with the dust of the road , its window closed tight so you know that the people who climb out of_it would be cool and unwrinkled . 
they be an old fat couple ( as person describe them to herself ) , a thick middle-aged man , and a girl about ten or twelve . 
there be much embracing , much exclaiming . 
`` person ! 
person '' ! 
`` person '' ! 
`` person '' ! 
`` and how be she '' ? 
`` about the same , person , about the same '' . 
all the woman get_up and offer their chair , and when they were all seated again , the guest make their inquiry and their explanation . 
`` we be on our vacation in canada '' , person explain , in a muffled voice that must have been used_to boom , `` and the news did n't catch_up_with us till we be nearly home . 
we come_on as_soon_as we could '' . 
there be the suggestion of ice_water , and - in_spite of the protest `` we 're not really thirsty '' - person , to escape the stuffy air and the smothering soft voice , hurry to the kitchen . 
she fill a big pitcher and set it , with glass , on a tray . 
carry it to the living_room , she imagine the picture she make : tall and roundly slim , a_bit sophisticated in her yellow sheath , with a graceful swingy walk that she had learn as a twirler with the school band . 
almost immediately she was ashamed of herself for feel vain , at such a time , in such a place , and she toss_back her long yellow hair , smile shyly as she enter the room . 
person ( the thick middle-aged man ) was look at her . 
she feel the look and look back because she could not help it , see that he be neither as old nor as thick as she had at_first believe . 
`` and who be this '' ? he ask , when she pass him a glass . 
`` oh that 's person '' , person say fondly . 
`` she marry our baby boy , person , this summer '' . 
`` let 's see '' , person say . 
`` he 's a right_smart young than the rest '' ? 
`` oh yes '' , mama laugh . 
`` he 's ten year young than person . 
we did n't expect him to come_along ; think for the long he be a tumor '' . 
this joke be not funny to person , and she blush , as she always did ; then , hear the muffled boom of person 's laughter , blush red . 
`` who be person , anyway '' ? she ask person that night . 
`` he make me uncomfortable '' . 
`` oh he 's a second_cousin or something . 
he get_in the oil_business out at odessa and luck_into some money '' . 
`` how old be he '' ? 
`` gosh , i do n't know . 
thirty-five , i guess . 
he 's be married and get this half grown kid . 
if he bother you , do n't pay him any mind . 
he 's just a big windbag '' . 
person was think_about something else . 
`` say , did you know they 're fix to have a two day antelope season on the double_x '' ? 
he was talk_about antelope again when they wake_up . 
`` listen , i never have a chance to kill an antelope . 
there never be a season before , but now they want to thin_out 'em out on_account_of the drouth '' . 
`` did he ever visit here when he be a kid '' ? 
person ask . 
`` who '' ? 
`` person '' . 
`` hell , i do n't know . 
when he be a kid i was n't around '' . 
person take a gun from behind the door , and with a quick `` bye_now '' be gone for the day . 
almost immediately person and his daughter person drive_up in the cadillac . 
`` we 're go_after ice '' , person say , `` and think maybe you 'd go along and keep_company us company '' . 
there be really no reason to refuse , and person had never ride in a cadillac . 
drive along the caliche-topped road to town , person talk . 
finally he say , `` tell me about yourself '' , and person tell him , because she think herself that she had had an interesting life . 
she be such a well-rounded teenager , having be a twirler , future_farmers sweetheart , and secretary of future_homemakers . 
in her sophomore year she had start go_steady with person , who be a football_player , future_homemakers sweetheart , and president of future_farmers . 
it be easy to see that they were make_for each other , and they know what they want . 
person would be a senior this year , and he plan to graduate . 
but there be no need for person to go_on , since all she want in life be to make a home for person and ( blush ) raise his child . 
person sigh . 
`` you lucky kid '' , he say . 
`` i 'd give anything if i could have find a girl like you '' . 
then he tell person about himself . 
of_course he could n't say much , really , because of person , but person could imagine what kind of woman his wife had be and what a raw_deal he had_got . 
it make her feel differently about person . 
she was going_to tell person about how mistaken she had be , but he bring one of the cousin home for supper , and all they do be talk_about antelope . 
person was try to get person to say she would cook one if he bring it home . 
`` cook a whole antelope '' ? she exclaim . 
`` why , i could n't even cook a piece of antelope steak ; i never even see any '' . 
`` oh , you could . 
i want to roast the whole_thing , and have it for the boy '' . 
person tell him he could n't do anything like that with his grandma die , and he say well they had_to eat , did n't they , they were n't all die . 
person feel_like go_off to the bedroom to cry ; but they were go_up to the big_house after supper , and she had_to put_on a clean dress and fix her hair a_little . 
every_night they all go_to mama and papa person 's , and sit on the open front_porch , where they could get the breeze . 
it be full-of-the-moon ( or a_little past ) , and nearly light as day . 
they all sit around and drink ice_water , and the man smoke , and everybody have a good time . 
once_in_a_while they say what a shame it be , with granny die , but they all agree she would n't have want it any other way . 
that night the older man got_to talk_about go possum hunting on a moonlight night . 
person and two or three of the other boy declare they had never be possum hunting , and person ( from person 's side of the family ) say he would just get_up from there and take them , right then . 
after they had leave , some of the people move around , to find more comfortable place to sit . 
there be not many chair , so that some prefer to sit on the edge of the porch , rest their foot on the ground , and_others like to sit where they could lean_back against the wall . 
person , who had been sit against the wall , say he need more fresh air , and take the spot on the edge of the porch where person had been sit . 
`` you 'll be a darn sight more comfortable there , person '' , person say , laugh , and they all laugh . 
person feel that she be not exactly more comfortable . 
person had been sit close to her , touch her actually , and hold her hand from_time_to_time , but it seem at_once that person sit much closer . 
perhaps it be just that he have so much more flesh , so that more of it seem to come in contact with hers ; but she had never been so aware of anyone 's flesh before . 
still she be not sorry he sit by her , but in_fact was flatter . 
he had become the center of the company , such story he have to tell . 
he had sell oil stock to person and person in_person ; he had help fight an oil_well fire that rage six day and night . 
`` but tell me , doctor , where do you plan to conduct the hatching '' ? 
person ask . 
`` that will have to be in the hotel '' , the doctor retort , confirm person 's anticipation . 
`` what i want you to do is to go_to the market with me early tomorrow morning and help smuggle the hen back into the hotel '' . 
the doctor pay the bill and they repair_to the hotel , room number nine , to initiate person further into these undertaking . 
the doctor open the smallest of his case , an unimposing straw bag , and expose the content for person 's inspection . 
inside , carefully pack in straw , be six egg , but the eye of a poultry psychologist was require to detect what scientifically valuable specimentalia lie inside ; to person they be merely six not unusual hen ' egg . 
there was little enough time to contemplate them , however ; in an instant the doctor was stalk across the room with an antique ledger in his hand , thoroughly eared and big as a tabletop . 
he place it on person 's lap . 
`` this be my hen ledger '' , he inform him in an absorbed way . 
`` it 's been go since 1908 when i be a junior in college . 
that first entry there be the vermont_flumenophobe , the early and one of the most successful of my eighty-three variety - great big scapular and hardly any primary at_all . 
could n't take them near a river , though , or they 'd squawk like a turkey_cock the day before thanksgiving '' . 
the ledger be full of most precise information : 
date of laying , length of incubation_period , number of chick reach the first week , second week , fifth week , weight of hen , size of rooster 's wattle and_so_on , all scrawl out in a hand that look more chinese than english , the most jagged and sprawling person had ever see . 
below these particular be a series of alpha beta gamma connect by arrow and cross which denote the lineage of the breed . 
person 's instruction be rapid , for the doctor had_to go_off to the group to hear more speech with only time for one sip of wine to sustain him through them all . 
but after the doctor 's return that night person could see , from the high window in his own room , the now familiar figure crouch on a truly impressive heap of towel , apparently give its egg hatching power one final chance before it was replace in its office by a sure-enough hen . 
a knocking at person 's door rouse him at six o'clock the following morning . 
it be the doctor , dressed and ready for the expedition to the market , and person was oblige to prepare himself in_haste . 
the doctor stand about , wait for person to dress , with a show of impatience , and soon they were move , as quietly as could be , through the still dark hallway , past the bedroom of the patronne , and so into the street . 
the market be not far and , once there , the doctor 's sense of immediacy leave him and he fall into a state of harmony with the bird around him . 
he stroke the hen and they respond with delighted cluck , he gobble with the turkey and they at_once be all attention , he quack with the duck , and cackle with a pair of exceedingly flatter goose . 
the dawn progress and it seem that the doctor would never be done_with his ministration when quite abruptly something break his revery . 
it be a fine broody_hen , white , with a maternal eye and a striking abundance of feather in the under region of the abdomen . 
the doctor , with the air of a man whose professional interest have find scope , draw person 's attention to those excellence which might otherwise have escape him : the fine color in comb and wattle , the length and quality of neck and saddle_hackle , the firm , wide spread of the toe , and a rare justness in the formation of the ear lappet . 
all search was end ; he had find his fowl . 
the purchase was effect and they make_one's_way towards the hotel again , the hen , with whom some sort of communication had been set_up , nestle in the doctor 's arm . 
the clock strike seven-thirty as they approach the hotel entrance ; and hope that the chambermaid and patronne would still be abed begin to rise in person 's well exercise breast . 
the doctor was wear a long new_england greatcoat , hardly necessary in the june weather but a garment which prove well adapted to the sequestration of hen . 
person enter first and was follow by the doctor who , for all his care , manifest a perceptible bulge on his left side where the hen was cradle . 
they advance in a line across the entrance_hall to the stairway and up , with gingerly step , towards the first landing . 
it was then that they hear the tread of one descend and , in some perturbation glance up , see the patronne come towards them as they gain the landing . 
`` bonjour , monsieur , vous etes matinals '' , she greet them pleasantly . 
person explain that they had been out for a stroll before breakfast while the doctor edge around behind him , attempt to hide the protuberance at his left side behind person 's arm and back . 
`` vous voulez vos petits dejeuners tout de suite alors '' ? their hostess enquire . 
person tell her that there be no hurry for their breakfast , try at_the_same_time to effect a speedy separation of the person before and behind him . 
the doctor , he notice , was attempt a transverse movement towards the stairs , but before the movement could be complete a distinct and audible cluck ruffle the air in the hollow of the stairwell . 
eye swerve in the patronne 's head , person cough loudly , and the doctor , with a sforzando of chicken noise float behind him , take to the stairs in long-shanked leap . 
`` comment '' ? ejaculate the surprised woman , look at person for an explanation but he , part from her without ceremony , only offer a_few words about the doctor 's provincial american speech and a state of nerves bring_on by the demand of his work . 
with_that he hurry up_the_stairs , follow by her suspicious gaze . 
when person enter his room , the doctor was already prepare a nest in the straw case , six egg ready for the hen 's attention . 
there be no reference to the incident on the stairs , his power being absorb by this more immediate business . 
the hen appear to have no doubt as to her duty and be quick to settle_down to the performance of them . 
one part of her audience be totally engaged , the connoisseur witness a peculiarly fine performance of some ancient classic , the other part , the guest of the connoisseur , attentive as one who must take an intelligent interest in_that which he does not fully understand . 
the spectacle progress towards a denouement which be obviously still remote ; the audience attend . 
time elapse but the doctor be obviously unconscious of its passage until an unwelcome knock on the door interrupt the process of nature . 
startled , he jump up to pull hen and case out of view , and person go_to the door . 
he open it a crack and in do so make_noise as as_much_as_possible shuffling , coughing , and scraping noise as possible in_order to drown emanation from the hen who had begin to protest . 
it be person , the fille_de_chambre , come to clean the room , and while she stand before him with ear prick_up and regard all curiosity , explain her errand , person could see from the corner of his eye the doctor do all he could to calm the displeased bird . 
person be reluctant but person succeed in persuade her to come_back in five minute and the door was shut again . 
`` who be that , young feller '' ? the doctor instantly ask . 
`` that be the fille_de_chambre , the one you think could n't get the egg out . 
she look mighty interested , though . 
anyhow she 's come_back in five minute to do the room '' . 
the doctor 's mind was work at a great speed ; he rise to put_on his greatcoat on and address person in a muted voice . 
`` have you have_got our key handy '' ? 
`` right in my pocket '' . 
`` all_right . 
now you go outside and beckon me when it 's safe '' . 
the hall be empty and person beckon ; they climb the stairs which creak , very_loudly to their sensitive ear , and reach the next floor . 
a guest was lock his room ; they pass behind him and get to person 's room unnoticed . 
the doctor sit_down rather wearily , caress the hen and remark that the city be not the place for a poultry loving man , but no_sooner be the remark out than a knock at this door oblige him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once_more . 
at the door person manage to persuade the increasingly astonished fille_de_chambre to return in ten minute . 
it be evident that a second transfer had to be effect , and that it had to take_place between the time the fille_de_chambre finish the doctor 's room and the time she begin person 's . 
they wait three minute and_then creep out on tiptoe ; the hall be empty and they pass down_the_stairs to number nine and listen at the door . 
a bustle of sheet being smooth and pillow being arrange indicate the fille_de_chambre 's presence inside ; they listen and suddenly a step towards the door announce another important fact . 
the doctor shoot_down to the lavatory and turn the doorknob , but to no effect : the lavatory be occupied . 
although a look of alarm pass_over his face , he did not arrest his movement but disappear into the shower_room just as the chambermaid emerge from number nine . 
person suppress those expression of relief which offer to prevail in his face and escape from his throat ; unwarranted they be in_any_case for , as he stand face the fille_de_chambre , his ear were assail by new sound from the interior of the shower_room . 
the event of the last quarter of an hour , mysterious to any bird accustom only to the predictable life of coop and barnyard , had overcome the doctor 's hen and she give_out a series of cackly wail , perhaps mourn her nest , but briefly enjoy . 
the doctor 's wit had not leave him , however , for all his sixty-eight years , and the wail were almost immediately lose in the sound of water rush_out from the showerhead . 
person nod to the maid as though nothing unusual were take_place and enter the doctor 's room . 
shortly , the doctor himself enter , his hair somewhat wet from the shower , but evidently satisfied with the outcome of their adventure . 
without comment he open the closet and from its shelf construct a highboard around the egg case which he had place on the floor inside . 
next , the hen was nest and all seem well . 
the two man sit for some time , savor the pleasure of escape from peril and the relief such escape bring , before they get_up and leave the hotel , the doctor to go_to the conference_house and person to go_to the main post_office . 
person return to the hotel , rather weary and with no new prospect of a role , in the late afternoon , but find the doctor in an ebullient mood . 
at the time person arrive he was engage in some sort of intimate communication with the hen , who had settle herself on the nest most peacefully after the occurrence of the morning . 
`` chicken have short memory '' , the doctor remark , `` that 's why they be better company than most people i know '' , and he go_on to break some important news to person . 
`` well '' , he begin , `` it seem like some people in paris want to hear more from me than those fellers over at the conference_house do . 
they 've get a big vulture from location at the zoo here , with a wife for him , too , very rare bird , both of them , the only vulturidae of their species outside africa . 
seem like she 's willing , but the male just flop around all day like the bashful boy who take person behind the barn and_then did n't know what to do , and the people at the zoo have n't get any vulture chick to show for their trouble . 
go downstairs with the tray , person wish he could have give_in to person , but he know better than to do what she say when she have that little girl look . 
there be time it be n't right to make a person happy , like the time she come_in the kitchen and ask for a peanut_butter sandwich . 
`` you know we do n't keep peanut_butter in_this house '' , he always tell her . 
`` why , person '' , she 'd cry , `` i just_now see you eat it out of the jar '' ! 
but he know how important it be for her to keep her figure . 
in the kitchen , person , his little young wife , was read the morning paper . 
her leg hang down long and thin as she sit on the high stool . 
`` here '' , person say gently , `` what 's these dish doing not washed '' ? 
the enormous plate which had hold person 's four fried_egg and five strip of bacon were still stack in the sink . 
`` leave me alone '' , person say . 
`` ca n't you see i'm busy '' ? 
she look at him impudently over the corner of the paper . 
`` this be moving day '' , person remind her , `` and i bet you leave thing every_which_way upstairs , your clothes all_over the floor and the bed not made . 
person '' ! 
his eye had fasten on her leg ; bend , he touch her knee . 
`` if i catch you one more time down here without stocking '' - 
she twitch her leg away . 
`` fuss , fuss , old_man '' . 
she have an alley_cat 's manners . 
person stack person 's thin pink dish in the sink . 
then he spread_out the last list on the counter . 
`` to be leave behind '' be printed at the top in person ; fine hand . 
person take_out a pencil , admire the point , and write slowly and heavily , `` clothes stand '' . 
sigh , person drop the paper and stand_up . 
`` i guess i better get ready to go '' . 
person watch her fumble to untie her apron . 
`` here '' . 
carefully , he undo the bow . 
`` how_come your bow be always cockeyed '' ? 
she turn and put her arm around his neck . 
`` i do n't want to leave here , person '' . 
`` now listen to that '' . 
he draw_back , embarrassed and pleased . 
`` i think you be sick_to_death of_this big house . 
say you wear_out yourself out , clean all these empty room '' . 
`` at_least there be room here '' , she say . 
`` what room be there going_to be in an apartment for any child '' ? 
`` i tell you what person 's doctor say '' . 
`` i do n't mean person ! 
what you think i care about that ? 
i mean our child '' . 
she sound as though they already exist . 
in_spite of the hundred thing he have on his mind , person went and put his arm around her waist . 
`` we 've got plenty of time to think_about that . 
all the time in_the_world . 
we 've only be married four year , january '' . 
`` four year '' ! she wail . 
`` that 's a long_time , wait '' . 
`` how many time have i tell you '' - he begin , and be almost glad when she cut_off him off - `` too many time '' ! 
- and flounce to the sink , where she begin noisily to wash her hand . 
too many time be the truth of_it , person think . 
he hardly believe his reason himself anymore . 
although it had seem a good reason , to_begin_with : no couple could afford to have child . 
`` how you going to work with a child hang_on you '' ? 
he ask person . 
`` you want to keep this job , do n't you '' ? 
he doubt whether she hear him , over the running water . 
he sit for_a_while with his hand on his knee , watch the bend of her back as she gather_up her thing - a comb , a bottle of aspirin - to take upstairs and pack . 
she make him sad some day , and he be never sure why ; it be something to do with her back , the thinness of_it , and the quick , jerky way she bend . 
she be too young , that be all ; too young and thin and straight . 
`` person '' ! 
it be person , bellow out in the hall . 
person hurry through the swinging_door . 
`` i 've been burst my lung for you '' , person complain . 
he was stand in_front_of the mirror , tighten his tie . 
he have_on his gray tweed overcoat and his city hat , and his briefcase lie on the bench . 
`` i do n't know what you think you 've been do about my clothes '' , he say . 
`` this coat look_like a rag heap '' . 
there be a_few blade of lint on the shoulder . 
person take the clothesbrush out of the closet and went to work . 
he give person a real going-over ; he brush his shoulder and his back and his collar with long , firm stroke . 
`` hey '' ! 
person cry when the brush tip his hat down over his eye . 
person apologize and quickly set the hat right . 
then he stand_back to look at person , who was pull on his pigskin gloves . 
person enjoy see him start_out ; he wear his clothes with style . 
when he was go_to town , nothing be good enough - he had curse at person once for leave a fleck of polish on his shoelace . 
at home , he would n't even wash his hand for supper , and he wander around the yard in a pair of sweaty old corduroys . 
the velvet smoking_jacket , pearl gray , wine , and blue , which person had buy him hang brushed and unworn in the closet . 
`` good-by , person '' , person say , give a final set to his hat . 
`` look_out for those mover '' ! 
person watch him hurry down the drive to his car ; a handsome , fine-looking man it make him proud to see . 
after person drive away , person go_on look out the window . 
he notice a speck of dirt on the sill and swipe at it with his finger . 
then he look at his finger , at the wrinkled , heavy knuckle and the thick nail he use like a knife to pry up , slit , and open . 
for_the_first_time , he let himself be sad about the move . 
that house be ten year off his life . 
each brass handle and hinge shine for his reward , and he know how to get_at the dust in the china flower and how to take_down the long glass drop which hang from the chandelier . 
he know the house like a blind_man , through his finger , and he did not like to think_of all the time and rag and polish he had spend on keep_up it up . 
ten year ago , he had come to the house to be interview . 
the tulip and the big pink peony had been bloom along the drive , and he had walk up from the bus almost sing . 
person had been out back , in a straw_hat , plant flower . 
she had talk to him right there , with the hot sun in his face , which make him sweat and feel ashamed . 
person had been surprised at her for that . 
still , he had like the way she had look , in a fresh , neat cotton dress - citron yellow , if he remember . 
she had have a dignity about her , even barefoot and almost too tan . 
since then , the flower she had plant had spread all_over the hill . 
already the jonquil were bloom in a flock by the front gate , and the periwinkle were come_on , blue by the porch steps . 
in a week the hyacinth would spike_out . 
and the dogwood in early may , for person 's alfresco party ; and after that the japanese_cherry . 
now the yard look wet and bald , the tree bare under their bud , but in a while person 's flower would bloom like a marching parade . 
she had dig a hole for each bulb , each tree wear a tag with her writing on_it ; where would she go for her gardening now ? 
somehow person did n't think she 'd take_to window_box . 
sigh , he hurry to the living_room . 
he had a_thousand thing to see to . 
still , he could n't help think , we 're all get old , get small ; the snail is pull_in her horn . 
in the living_room , person was stand by the window with a sheaf of list in her hand . 
she was look out at the garden . 
`` person '' , she say , `` get the basket for the breakable '' . 
person had the big straw basket ready in the hall . 
he bring it in and put it down beside her . 
person was look fine ; she have_on her easter suit , blue , with lavender binding . 
halfway across the house , he could have smell her morning perfume . 
it hang_in all her day clothes , sweet and strong ; sometimes when he was press , person raise her dress to his face . 
frown , person study the list . 
`` well , let 's see . 
the china lemon_tree . 
the alabaster cockatoo '' . 
person follow her around the room , collect the small frail object ( christmas , birthday , and anniversary ) and wrap them in tissue_paper . 
neither of them trust the mover . 
when they come to person 's photograph , twenty by twelve inch in a curly silver frame , person say , `` by_rights i ought to leave that , see he won n't take my clotheshorse '' . 
she smile at person , and he see the hateful hard glitter in her eye . 
he pick_up the photograph and begin to wrap it . 
`` at_least you could leave it for the mover '' , person say . 
`` what possessed you to tell me a clotheshorse would be a good idea '' ? 
person fold the tissue_paper carefully . 
`` he 's use it every_day ; every morning , i lay_out his clothes on_it '' . 
`` well , that 's over now . 
and it be his main present ! 
leave that fool picture out '' , she add sharply . 
person lay it in the basket . 
`` person set store by that '' . 
`` really , person . 
it was mean to be my present '' . 
but she go_on down the list . 
person be relieved ; those present had been on his mind . 
he had only agree with person about get the valet , but he had actually suggest the photograph to person . 
`` you know what she like , person '' , he had say wearily , one evening in november when person was pull_off his overshoe . 
`` tell me what to get her for christmas '' . 
`` she 's been talk_about a picture '' , person had tell him . 
`` picture ! 
you mean picture of me '' ? 
but person had persuade him . 
on christmas night , they had had a disagreement about it . 
person had hear because he was set_up the liquor tray in the next room . 
through the door , he had see person walk_around , wait for person . 
finally she had come_down ; person had hear her shake out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess gown . 
`` how do you like it '' ? she had ask . 
person had say , `` you look about fifteen year old '' . 
`` is that a compliment '' ? 
`` i do n't know '' . 
he had stand at a_little distance , study her , as though he would walk_around next and look at the back of her head . 
`` lovie , you make me feel naked '' . 
person had giggle , and she go sweep and rustle to the couch and sink down . 
`` you look like that picture i have at the office '' , person had start . 
`` not a line , not a wrinkle . 
i look_like an old_man , compare '' , and he had pick_up his photograph with the red christmas bow still on_it . 
`` look , an old_man . 
will you wear pink when you 're sixty '' ? 
`` darling , i love that photograph . 
i'm going_to put it on my dresser '' . 
`` i guess it 's child make a woman old . 
a man get old anyhow '' . 
after a minute he go_on , `` people must think the curse be on me , see you fresh as an apple and me old and gray '' . 
`` i 'll give you a medical certificate , frame , if you like '' , person had say . 
`` no . 
all i want be a picture - with a_few line . 
make the man put them in if he has to '' . 
after that they had sit for five minute without say a word . 
then person had stand_up , rustle and rustle , and go upstairs . 
was it love ? 
i have no_doubt that it be . 
during the rest of the summer my scholarly mania for make plaster_cast and spatter print of location flower and leaf was all_but surpass by the constantly renew impression of person that my mind serve_up to me for contemplation and delight . 
nothing in_all the preceding year had have the power to bring me close to a knowledge of profound sorrow than the breakup of camp , the packing away of my camp uniform , the severing of tie with the six or ten people i had grow most to love in the world . 
in final separation from them , in the railroad_terminal across the river from new_york , i would nearly cry . 
my parent ' welcoming arm would seem woeful , inadequate , unwanted . 
but that year be different , for just as the city , in the form of my street clothes , had intrude upon my mountain night , so an essential part of the summer give promise of continue into the fall : person and i , about to be separate not by a mere footbridge or mess_hall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of reside in cruelly distant borough , had agree to correspond . 
these letter become the center of my existence . 
i live to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock_in myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an answer . 
my memory have catalogue for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink , scented stationery and the unsloped , almost printed configuration of her neat , studious handwriting with which she invite me to recall our summer , so many sentence begin with `` remember when '' ; and_others concern camp friend who reside in her suburban neighborhood , and news of her commence again her piano_lesson , her private_school , a visit to boston to see her grandparent and an uncle who be a surgeon return on furlough , wounded , from the war in europe . 
in my letter i take_on a personality that differ from the self i know in real_life . 
then epistolatory me be a foreign correspondent dispatch exciting cable and communique , full of dash and wit and glamor , quote from the book i read , imitate the grand style of the author recommend by a teacher in whose special , after-school class i was enrol . 
the letter take their source from a stream of my imagination in which i was transform into a young_man not unlike my bunkmate person - he of the porch steps anecdote - who smoke cigarette , perform the tango , wear fifty dollar suit , and sneak_off into the dark with girl to do unimaginable thing with them . 
like person , in my fantasy , i have a proud bearing and , with a skill that be vaguely continental , i would lead person through an evening of dancing and handsome description of my newest exploit , would guide her gently to the night 's climax which , in my dream , was always represent by our almost suffocate one another to death with deep , moist kiss burn with love . 
the night after read her letter about her surgeon uncle - it must have be late in september - i have a vision of myself return in ragged uniform from the front , nearly die , my head bandaged and bloody , and person bend over me , the power of her love bring me back to life . 
for many night afterward , the idea of her having been so close to me in_that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desire , would cause me to lie_awake in shame , toss with irresolution , long to fall_asleep into a deep sleep . 
the week go_by , and the long our separation grow , the more unbounded and almost unbearable my fantasy become . 
they cause my love for person to become warm and at_the_same_time more hopeless , as if my adolescent self know that only torment would ever bring me the courage to ask to see her again . 
as it turn_out , person took matter into her own hands . 
having receive permission to give a camp reunion halloween party , she ask that i come and be her date . 
i go and , mum and nervous , all_but make a fool of myself . 
again among those jubilantly reunite bunkmate , i be shy with person and act as i had during those early saturday morning when we all seem to be playing_for_effect , to be detached and unconcerned with the girl who be properly our date but about whom , later , in the privacy of our bunk , we would think in_terms_of the most elaborate romance . 
i remember stand in a corner , watch person act the hostess , serve soft_drink to her guest . 
she was wear her dark hair in two , thick braid to attain an `` american_girl '' effect she think be appropriate to halloween . 
it make her look sweet and schoolgirlish , i be excited to be with her , but i did not know how to express it . 
yet a moment did come that night when the adventurous letter_writer and fantasist seem to stride off my flashy page , out of my mind , and plant himself in reality . 
it be late , we were play kissing game , and person and i call_on to kiss in_front_of the others . 
we blush and were fluster , and it turn_out to be the fleet brush of lip upon cheek . 
the kiss outrage our friend but it was do and meanwhile had release in me all the remote , exciting premonition of lust , all the mysterious sensation that i had imagined a truly consummated kiss would convey to me . 
it be at that party that , finally overcome my timidity , inspire by tale only half understood and overhear among old boy , i ask person to spend new_year's_eve with me . 
lovingly , she accept , and so great be my emotion that all i could think_of say be , `` you 're amazing , you_know '' ? 
later , we agree to think_of how we wish to spend that night . 
we would write to one another and make a definite plan . 
she be terribly pleased . 
among my school and neighborhood friend , during the next month , i brag and swagger and pompously describe my impending date . 
but though i boast and give_off a dapper front , i be beneath_it_all frightened . 
it would be the first time i had ever be completely alone with a girl i love . 
i have no idea of_what subject one discuss when alone with a girl , or how one behave : 
should i hold her hand while walk or only when cross the street ? 
should i bring along a corsage or send one to her ? 
was it preferable to meet her at home or in the city ? 
should i accompany her to the door of her home , or should i ask to be invite in ? 
in or out , should i kiss her good_night ? 
all this be unknown to me , and yet i had dare to ask_out her out for the most important night of the year ! 
when in one letter person inform me that her father did not like the idea of her go_out alone on new_year's_eve , i know for a moment an immense relief ; but the letter go_on : she had cry , she had implore , she had be miserable at his refusal , and finally he had relent - and now how happy she be , how expectant ! 
her optimism give me heart . 
i force confidence into myself . 
i make inquiry , i read a book of etiquette . 
in december i write her with_authority that we would meet on the steps of the location , a rendezvous spot that i had learn be the most sophisticated . 
we would attend a film and , later_on , i state , we might go to the location or location 's or location 's for waffle . 
i set the hour of our meeting for seven . 
at five o'clock that night it be already dark , and behind my closed door i was dress as carefully as a groom . 
i wear a new double-breasted brown worsted suit with a faint herringbone design and wide lapel like a devil 's ear . 
my camp made leather wallet , bulky with twisted , raised stitch around the edge , i stuff with money i had been save . 
hatless , in an overcoat of rough blue wool , i was give a proud farewell by my mother and father , and i set_out into the strangely still street of brooklyn . 
i feel superior to the neighborhood friend i was leave_behind , feel old than my years , and be full of compliment for myself as i head into the subway that was carry its pack of passenger out of_that dull borough and into the unstable , tantalizing excitement of manhattan . 
location , when i ascend to_it with my fellow subway traveller ( all dress as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we be all distant member ) , be nearly impassable , the sidewalk swarming_with celebrant , with bundled-up sailor and soldier already hug their girl and their rationed bottle of whiskey . 
heavy-coated , severe looking policeman sit astride noble horse along the curbside to prevent the reveller from spill_out in_front of the crawling traffic . 
the night be cold but the crowd keep one warm . 
the giant electric sign and marquee were light_up for_the_first_time since blackout regulation had been institute , and the atmosphere be alive with the feeling that victory be just around_the_corner . 
cardboard noisemaker , substitute for the unavailable tin model , were being hawk and buy at makeshift stand every few yard along location , and one 's ear were continually serenade by the horn ' rasp and bleat . 
an old gentleman next to me hold a boy_scout bugle to his lip and blast away at every fourth step and during the interim shout_out , `` v for victory '' ! 
his neighbor cheer him on . 
there be a great sense of camaraderie . 
how did one join them ? 
where were they all walk to ? 
was i supposed to buy a funny hat and a rattle for person ? 
it be a quarter of seven when the crowd washed_me_up among the other gallant who had establish the location steps as the beachhead from which to launch their night of merrymaking . 
i look over their face and feel a twinge : they all look so much more knowing than i . 
i look_away . 
i look_for person to materialize out of the clogging , curdling crowd and , as the time pass and i wait , a fiend came_to_life beside me and whisper in my ear : how was i plan to greet person ? 
where exactly would we go after the movie ? 
suppose the line in_front_of the movie_house be too long and we could n't get_in ? 
suppose i had n't bring along enough money ? 
i feel for my wallet . 
its thick , substantial outline calm me . 
but when i see that it be already ten past seven , i begin to wonder if something had go_wrong . 
suppose her father had change his mind and had refuse to let her leave ? 
suppose at this very moment her father was call my house in an effort to cancel the plan ? 
i grow uneasy . 
all about me there be a hectic interplay of meeting take_place , like abrupt , jerky scene in old silent_movie , joyous greeting and beginning , hugging and kissing , enthusiastic forays into the festive night . 
whole platoon were take_up new position on the steps , arrive and depart , while i stay glued , like a signpost , to one spot . 
at 7 : 25 two hotel doorman come thump down the steps , carry a sawhorse to be set_up as a barricade in_front_of the haberdashery_store window next to the entranceway , and as i watch them in their gaudy red coat that nearly scrape the ground , their golden , fringed epaulet and spic , red visored cap , i suddenly see just over their shoulder person gracefully make_one's_way her way through the crowd . 
my heart almost stop beat . 
`` right '' , say the fingerprint_man . 
`` also , if you 're going_to believe those fingerprint , you 'll have to look_for a killer who 's a top-grade piano_player '' . 
he demonstrate by play an imaginary piano , do a staccato passage with a broadly exaggerated attack . 
to make it clear he shift to act_out , but with no change of manner , the killing of person . 
his hand snatch at an imaginary bucket , swoop down hard to grab it and come_away with equal snap like a ball that 's been bounce hard . 
in the same way he pantomime grasp a mantel and bounce cleanly off that , press his hand against the floor and bounce cleanly off that . 
he was move like a ballet_dancer , play for laugh . 
if person 's killer act this way , catch_up_with him was going_to be a cinch . 
we 'd know him by his stretch_pants and the flower he 'd wear twine in his hair . 
perhaps if person had first come_upon us when this boy was not cavort so gaily up_and_down the hall outside the murdered woman 's apartment , we might have have less trouble convince person of our seriousness . 
this , you will remember , be still new_year's_day . 
by the time person turn_up it be early afternoon , which , one would think , would be late enough so that by then , except for small child and a_few hardy soul who had not_yet sober_up , it could have been expect that people would no_longer be have any sort of active interest in the previous night 's noisemaker and paper hat . 
person be the exception . 
he had retain his hat and his horn , and , whatever fun might still be go , he be ready to join it . 
that , incidentally , might give you some idea of what person be like . 
after_all , he had n't happen_upon us in_that second floor hall without warning . 
the me 's boy had finish their on-the-spot examination and the body had been remove for autopsy . 
the meat wagon , therefore , be not out in_front of the house anymore , but the cluster of squad_car be still there and there be a cop on the door downstairs to screen any coming and going . 
there be , furthermore , the crowd of curious onlooker gather in the street and a couple more cop to hold them at a decent distance . 
just put yourself in person 's place for a moment . 
you 're a taxpayer , householder , landlord . 
you 've been away from home for the new_year's_eve festivity , but now the party be over and you come home . 
define sobriety in the limited sense of be free from the clinical symptom of the effect of alcohol ingest and not_yet eliminate from the system , you be sober . 
you still have your paper hat and you 're wear it , but then , it be an extraordinary paper hat and , in_addition to anything else you may be , you be also the sculptor who create that most peculiar dame out in the backyard . 
it 's not too_much to assume that you will have a more lasting interest in paper hat than will person . 
you have your paper horn clutch in your big , craggy fist , and for your entrance you have plan a noisy , colorful and exuberant greeting to your friend and tenant . 
you find your house a focus of public and police attention . 
can you imagine yourself forget under_the_circumstances that you are approach this startling and unexpected situation so unsuitably hat and armed with a paper horn ? 
maybe one could be startle into forgetfulness . 
you shoulder your way through the cluster of the curious and you barge up to the cop on the door . 
you identify yourself and ask him what 's go_on . 
instead of answer you , he stick his head in the door and shout up_the_stairs . 
`` get the upstairs guy '' , he bellow . 
`` the owner . 
do i send him up '' ? 
then he turn_back to you . 
`` go_on in '' , he say . 
`` they 'll tell you what 's cooking '' . 
even then , as you go_into the house oppressed by the knowledge that something_is_cooking and that your house has pass under this unaccountable , official control , could you go_on forget that you still have_on that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still carry that childish horn in your hand ? 
what i'm get at be that we be fully prepared for person 's be an odd one . 
we 'd see his handiwork out in the backyard , and the little his tenant had tell us of him did make him sound a_little special . 
we were not , however , prepare_for anything like the apparition that confront us as person come_up the stairs . 
he , of_course , must have been equally unprepared for what confront him , but , nonetheless , i did find his reaction startling . 
if person was still wear the hat and carry the horn because he 'd forget about them , he now remember . 
he come bound up_the_stairs and join the dance . 
he adjust the hat , lift the horn to his lip as_though it be a flute , and fall_in alongside our fingerprint_expert to cavort with him . 
our man stop_dead and glower at person . 
person throw his head back and laugh a laugh that shake the timber of even that solidly built old house . 
this be a bull of a man . 
he be big-chested , big-shouldered and heavy-armed . 
his face be ruddy and heavy and unlined , and when he laugh he show his tooth , which be big and white and strong and unquestionably homegrown . 
i do n't remember ever see tooth that be quite so white and at_the_same_time quite so emphatically not denture . 
his hair had recede most of the way to the back of his neck . 
he have only a fringe of hair and he wear it crop short . 
it be almost as white as his tooth . 
for a man of his mass he be curiously short . 
he be n't a dwarf but he be a_bit of a comic figure . 
a man with so big and so staggeringly developed a torso and such long and powerful arm is expect to stand tall than five foot five . 
for person it be a_bit of a stretch to make even that measurement . 
the man be just this side of be a freak . 
we wait till he had finish laugh , and that give us a_few moment for take_stock of him . 
he be dressed in a manner esquire might suggest for the outdoor_man 's country weekend . 
dark gray sports_jacket , light gray slacks , pink flannel shirt , black silk necktie . 
his eye be clear . 
he be freshly shaved , and if there had been any alcohol in him we could never have miss detect some scent of_it on the massive gust of his laughter . 
not even a whiff . 
eventually he subside . 
`` person '' ? 
person say . 
`` me '' , he say merrily . 
`` me , the happy one '' . 
`` that_much latin we remember '' , person say dryly . 
`` you always live_up_to your name , always like this , always make_happy '' ? 
`` i try '' , person say blithely . 
`` the world be full of bloke who put their heart into make the tragic scene . 
i 've never notice that it improve thing any '' . 
`` bully for you '' , person say . 
`` what 's the rest of your name '' ? 
`` no rest of_it . 
person be all there be '' . 
`` all there ever be '' ? 
`` the past i leave to historian '' , person intone , demonstrate that he could be pompous as_well_as happy . 
`` you live in the present '' ? 
`` in the present '' , person proclaim . 
`` for the future . 
is there any other time in which a man can live '' ? 
`` we '' , person announce , `` be not philosopher . 
we be person . 
this gentleman be a police_officer . 
he be a fingerprint_specialist . 
could your future , your immediate future , be make to include take us upstairs , give us a_bit of space in which our friend can work , and make available to him your fingertip '' ? 
the happy one could never have look happy . 
this be more_than joy . 
it be ecstasy . 
`` those lovely whorl '' , he chortle . 
`` so intricate , so beautiful . 
come_right_along . 
i love fingerprint '' . 
he was prance along the hall , head for the next flight_of_stairs . 
person call him back . 
`` we 're here because of_what happen last night '' , he say . 
`` past , yes , but important . 
since it be important , for the record let 's have the full name '' . 
`` that important '' ? 
person ask . 
`` that important '' . 
`` person '' , person whisper . 
`` person '' ? 
person ask , not bother to whisper . 
`` shh '' , person implore . 
`` i can n't see what would make it necessary for you to know . 
nothing could make it necessary to proclaim it to the whole world '' . 
obligingly person lower his voice . 
`` person '' ? 
he repeat . 
`` no . 
person , but not for year . 
for year it 's been just person . 
first thing i did after my twenty-first birthday be go_into court and have it officially change , and this be something i do n't tell everybody . 
that be almost forty year ago '' . 
having volunteer that he be a man of about sixty , he bound up_the_stairs and with each leap render the number less credible . 
this be a broth_of_a_boy , our person , and nothing be more obvious than the joy he take in demonstrate how agile he be and how full of juice and spirit . 
we follow him up_the_stairs . 
the cop would gather_up person and the foursome on the third floor and bring us those of them who would voluntarily submit to fingerprinting . 
you may think we did n't need person and person , but you always get what you can when you can , and we have no guarantee that a fingerprint record on them could n't be useful before we were through_with this case . 
also , if we had exclude the lady we would have_to that extent let the whole world know at_least that much of where we stand . 
the killer , if in our present group , would certainly be interested in know that much , and even_though with the fingerprint evidence what it be i could see no way he could use this bit of information to improve on his situation , there might always be some way . 
if you can possibly avoid it , you do n't hand_out any extra chance . 
person take us into his studio . 
it be that oddly shaped space at the very top of the house , where ceiling height had to accommodate themselves to the varying angle of roof slope . 
at each angle of its pitch a big skylight had been fit into the roof and all these skylight were fit with system of multiple screen and shade . 
when person first open the door on_it , all these shade were tightly draw and the whole studio be as dark as night . 
he quickly fix that , roll back the shade on some of the skylight and adjust screen on the others . 
he fly about the place make these adjustment and it be obvious that what he was do be the fruit of long experience . 
none of his movement be tentative . 
there be no process of trial_and_error . 
start with the room completely black_out , as it be when we come_in , he unerringly fix thing so that the whole place was bathe in the maximum of light without at any point admit even so much as a crack of glare . 
expect something more_than average wacky , i was surprise by what we find . 
there be no display of either work_in_progress or of finished work . 
here_and_there on work_table or pedestal stand a shape with a sheet or a tarpaulin drape over it . 
these shape might have be mad , but there be no tell . 
they were all completely shroud . 
the equipment be solid and heavy and in good condition . 
everything be orderly and it seem to be arrange for the workman 's comfort , convenience and efficiency . 
there be tool about but they were neatly keep . 
there be no confusion and no litter . 
supplies of sheet_metal were neatly stacked in bin . 
person did not see the newspaper the next day . 
someone on his staff - he suspect it be person - intercept them and for this person be grateful . 
he finally fall_asleep around six in the morning with the aid of a sleeping_capsule , a crutch he rarely use , and did n't awaken until early afternoon . 
memory flood him the instant he open his eye and the sick feeling knot his stomach . 
outside his window bloom a beautiful summer day . 
presumably the same sun was shine upon little person also , and those who had kidnap him . 
but where ? 
it be still a very big world , despite all the modern cant to_the_contrary . 
person was sit in a chair that block the hall door . 
he was doze , perhaps the only sleep he 'd get . 
he snap to alertness at person 's entrance . 
`` sorry , person . 
nothing new . 
a_lot of people wait to see you , though '' . 
`` reporter '' ? 
`` our own people . 
question about the show tonight '' . 
person pick_up the telephone . 
`` shall i let them know you 're awake '' ? 
`` i suppose . 
how 's person , do you know '' ? 
person consider . 
`` some better . 
she 's got plenty of guts , person . 
you want me to call her '' ? 
`` she expect me to '' ? 
person shake his head so person tell him not to bother . 
the only reason for contact person be to comfort or to be comfort . 
he could not manage the former or expect the latter ; they have nothing to give to each other . 
the omission might look peculiar to outsider , but person could not bring_oneself himself to go_through_the_motions simply for the sake of appearance . 
he have little time to himself , anyway . 
as the afternoon speed toward evening , the suite see a steady procession of person aide pass in and out , each with his own special problem . 
person arrive with the writer . 
they had spend the morning revise the act , eliminate all the gay song , patter and dancing with a view of the best public_relations . 
what remain lack the original verve but it be at_least dignified , as befit the tragic circumstance . 
person report that the orchestra had hastily rehearse `` cradle_song '' in_case it be needed . 
person be back_and_forth on several occasion , first to confer_with person on the advisability of cancel the las_vegas engagement - they decide it be wise - and later to announce that a prominent comedian , also an agency client , had agree to fill the casino 's open date . 
and once person slip in , pale and drawn , last night 's liquor still on his breath with some of today 's add to_it . 
he ask if there be anything he could do . 
person invent a job to keep him busy , send him ahead to location to supervise last-minute arrangement . 
but from location , they hear nothing . 
at_last it was time to depart . 
person , nose about , spot reporter in the lobby , so person was hustle away quietly through the hotel 's service_entrance in a strange car which person had procure somewhere . 
they succeed in elude the curious at the hotel , but there be no chance of avoid them at the nightclub . 
location was surround by a mob . 
they overflow the parking_lot , make progress by automobile difficult . 
long before he reach the protection of the stage_door , person was recognize . 
word of his arrival spread through the crowd like a brush_fire . 
they surge around him , finger point , eye pry . 
it be not a hostile gathering but person sense the difference from last night 's hero_worshipper . 
they had come not to admire but to observe . 
`` it 's worse inside '' , person inform person . 
`` person 's jam in every table he could find . 
under the heading of_it 's an ill wind , etcetera '' . 
backstage be tomb like by contrast . 
person 's co-worker keep their distance , awed by the tragedy . 
but in his dressing_room be a large bouquet and a card that read , `` we 're with you all_the_way '' . 
it was sign by everyone in the troupe . 
person could n't help but be touched . 
he instruct person to compose a note of thanks to be post on the call-board . 
person was wait to report that person had been sober_up to the point where he could function efficiently . 
person gather that this had be no small accomplishment . 
person himself look better ; any kind of job be better than brood . 
person tell him , `` person , i wish you 'd talk to person , see if some kind of pa_system can be rig_up outside . 
it 's just barely possible with this crowd that the kidnapper was n't able to get a table . 
i would n't want him to miss the message '' . 
`` i 'll try . 
person is n't going_to like it much , though , give_away what he should be sell '' . 
person be n't the only one who did n't care_for person 's scheme . 
a short time later , person stomp into the dressing_room . 
`` i got_a_bone_to_pick with you , person . 
it 's those damn loudspeaker '' . 
person roll_up the revised script he had been study . 
`` what about them '' ? 
`` they 're going_to louse_up me up good . 
my men have be here all afternoon , set_up for this thing '' . 
person explain that , with the nightclub 's cooperation , the police had occupy location like a battlefield . 
motion_picture camera had been install to film the audience , the reservation list was being check_out name by name , and a special detail be already at_work in the parking_lot scrutinize automobile for a possible lead . 
however , it was virtually impossible to screen the mob outside , even if person have manpower available for the purpose . 
`` i want you to have the speaker take_out '' . 
person sigh . 
`` seem like we 're never going to see_eye_to_eye , lieutenant . 
did n't they tell you what i want the pa_system for '' ? 
`` sure , i know . 
but it 's such a long_shot '' - 
`` no long than yours . 
what do you expect to get tonight , anyway ? 
you think somebody is going_to stand_up in the audience and make guilty face ? 
or have a sign on his car that say , ' here come the location kidnapper '' ' ? 
person crumble the script in his fist . 
`` i can n't stop you from do what you think be right . 
but do n't try to stop me , either '' . 
`` someday '' , person say , `` you 're going_to ask us for help . 
i can hardly wait '' . 
`` what you do n't understand be that i'm ask for it now '' . 
but person depart , still full of ill_will . 
he had gotten stuck_with a job too big for his imagination ; he had to cling_to routine , tested procedure . 
to act otherwise would be to admit his helplessness . 
but , admit or not , person be helpless . 
the crime show too much planning , the kidnapper appear too proficient to be catch by a checklist . 
person 's performance was schedule for eleven o'clock . 
he stall for a half-hour longer , hope to hear something from person about the ransom_money . 
person and person , on separate telephone , could not reach him at any conceivable location in los_angeles , nor could they secure any clear-cut information regard his effort . 
person curse . 
`` the sweaty bastard 's probably halfway to peru with our money by now '' . 
when no one smile , he feel constrained to add , `` just kid , natch '' . 
person pop_in to advise , `` person , person 's sending_up_smoke_signals . 
you about ready '' ? 
`` what 's he complain about '' ? 
person ask . 
`` they 're drink , are n't they '' ? 
`` no . 
we got a bunch of sipper out there tonight . 
i guess nobody want to pass_out and miss anything '' . 
person add in a low voice but person overhear , `` they act more like a jury than an audience '' . 
person say , `` well , i guess we can n't wait any longer . 
person , you stick by the stage_door . 
if person show_up during the number - or you hear anything - give me the signal '' . 
person say , `` i 'll stay on the phone , person . 
there 's a_couple_of call-back i can work_on '' . 
`` you be a sweetheart - but leave one line open . 
he may try to phone us '' . 
person pass into the corridor , their `` good_lucks '' ! follow him . 
it be what they say before every performance but tonight it sound differently , as if he really need it . 
they be right . 
the act , cut to shred and hastily patch together during the afternoon , had not been rehearse sufficiently by anyone . 
the result have nothing of the polish , pace or cohesion of the previous night . 
here 's where luck would normally step_in . 
but this be no ordinary show and person know it . 
whether he sing well or badly have nothing to do with_it . 
the audience had come not to be entertain but to judge . 
twenty-four_hours had change him from a performer to a freak . 
within this framework , what follow be strained , even macabre . 
eliminate the patter and the upbeat number leave little but blues and other song of equal melancholy . 
the effect be as depressing as a gravestone , the applause irresolute and short-lived . 
yet person plow_ahead , mouth the inconsequential words as if they possess real meaning , and gradually his listener warm_to him . 
their clapping grow more fervent ; the evening be still not beyond salvage , not as a show but for him as a person . 
the worst be yet to come . 
as person reach the finale of his act , a subdued commotion backstage draw his attention to the wing . 
person - a perspiring , haggard person - was stand there , flank by two man in the uniform of armored transport guard . 
person was nod and point at the large suitcase he hold . 
person feel his heart thud heavily with relief . 
he wave at person to cut_off the finale introduction . 
the music die_away discordantly . 
he draw a deep breath . 
`` lady and gentleman , in_place_of my regular closing number tonight , i 'd like to sing something of a different nature for you . 
person , if you please - the ' cradle_song '' ' . 
he sense rather_than hear the gasp that sweep across the audience . 
nor could he blame them . 
this particular song at this particular time could only be interpret as the ultimate in bad taste , callous exploitation beyond the bounds of decency . 
have no choice , he plunge into it , anyway , hold onto the microphone for support . 
`` lullaby_and_goodnight '' . 
voice shake . 
for_the_first_time in his life he forget the lyric midway through and had to cover_up by hum the rest . 
he wonder if the audience would let him finish . 
they did ; though contemptuous , they be still polite . 
but when he was finally through , their scorn was make apparent . 
someone clap tentatively then quickly stop . 
otherwise , the silence be complete . 
as the light come_up , person could see that a number of patron be already on their way toward the exit . 
he stumble offstage . 
`` my_god '' , he mutter . 
`` my_god '' . 
person be there to support him . 
`` it 's okay , location . 
the money 's here , all_of it '' . 
at this moment , all he could think_of be what he 'd been force to undergo . 
`` did you hear them ? 
do you know what they think_of me '' ? 
`` bunch of damn jerk '' , person growl . 
`` who needs them '' ? 
person pat his arm . 
`` sure , person , it 'll be all_right . 
nothing broken that can n't be mend '' . 
the words be hollow . 
person know , better than any of them , that a public image be as fragile as person . 
all the king 's horse and all the king 's man . 
location shoulder_in . 
`` i get_it , person . 
god_knows_how , but i get_it . 
you 'll never believe the place i 've be today . 
i practically had to sign your life away , you 'll probably fire me for some of the deal i had to go_for , but '' - 
person nod dully . 
`` it does n't matter , person . 
we 've do our part '' . 
he clutch that knowledge to him as he return to his dressing_room . 
the usual congratulatory crowd be conspicuously absent ; the place have the air of a morgue . 
person have no desire to linger himself but person report that the mob outside be still large despite the effort of the police to disperse them . 
now that he know himself to be self he be free to grok ever close to his brother , merge without let . 
self 's integrity be and be and ever had be . 
person stop to cherish all his brother self , the many threes-fulfilled on mars , corporate and discorporate , the precious few on earth - the unknown power of three on earth that would be his to merge with and cherish now that at_last long wait he grokked and cherish himself . 
person remain in trance ; there be much to grok , loose_end to puzzle_over and fit into his growing - all that he had see and hear and be at the location ( not just cusp when he and person had come face-to-face alone ) - why person make him warily uneasy , how person taste like a water_brother when she be not , the smell of goodness he had incompletely grokked in the jumping_up_and_down and wail - 
person 's conversation come and go - person 's word trouble him most ; he study them , compare them with what he had been teach as a nestling , struggle to bridge between language , the one he think with and the one he was learn to think in . 
the word `` church '' which turn_up over_and_over_again among person 's word give him knotty difficulty ; there be no martian concept to match it - unless one take `` church '' and `` worship '' and `` god '' and `` congregation '' and many other word and equate them to the totality of the only world he had know during growing wait & & & then force the concept back into english in_that phrase which had been reject ( by each differently ) by person , by person , by person . 
`` thou art god '' . 
he be close to understand it in english now , although it could never have the inevitability of the martian concept it stand_for . 
in his mind he speak simultaneously the english sentence and the martian word and feel close grokking . 
repeat it like a student tell himself that the jewel be in the lotus he sink into nirvana . 
before midnight he speed his heart , resume normal breathing , run_down his checklist , uncurl and sit_up . 
he had be weary ; now he feel light and gay and clearheaded , ready for the many action he see spread_out before him . 
he feel a puppyish need for company as strong as his earlier necessity for quiet . 
he step_out into the hall , be delight to encounter a water_brother . 
`` hi '' ! 
`` oh . 
hello , person . 
my , you look chipper '' . 
`` i feel fine ! 
where be everybody '' ? 
`` asleep . 
person and person go_home an hour ago and people start go_to_bed '' . 
`` oh '' . 
person feel disappoint that person had leave ; he want to explain his new grokking . 
`` i ought to be asleep , too , but i feel_like a snack . 
are you hungry '' ? 
`` sure , i'm hungry '' ! 
`` come_on , there be some cold chicken and we 'll see what else '' . 
they go downstairs , load a tray lavishly . 
`` let 's take it outside . 
it 's plenty warm '' . 
`` a fine idea '' , person agree . 
`` warm enough to swim - real indian_summer . 
i 'll switch_on the flood '' . 
`` do n't bother '' , person answer . 
`` i 'll carry the tray '' . 
he could see in almost total_darkness . 
person say that his night-sight probably come from the condition in which he had grow_up , and person grokked this be true but grokked that there be more to_it ; his foster_parent had teach him to see . 
as for the night be warm , he would have been comfortable naked on mount_everest but his water_brothers have little tolerance for change in temperature and pressure ; he be considerate of their weakness , once he learn of_it . 
but he was look_forward to snow - see for himself that each tiny crystal of the water of life be a unique individual , as he had read - walk barefoot , roll in it . 
in_the_meantime he be pleased with the warm night and the still more pleasing company of his water_brother . 
`` okay , take the tray . 
i 'll switch_on the underwater light . 
that 'll be plenty to eat by '' . 
`` fine '' . 
person like have light up through the ripple ; it be a goodness , beauty . 
they picnic by the pool , then lie back on the grass and look at star . 
`` person , there be mars . 
it be mars , is n't it ? 
or antares '' ? 
`` it be mars '' . 
`` person ? 
what are they do on mars '' ? 
he hesitate ; the question be too wide for the sparse english_language . 
`` on the side toward the horizon - the southern_hemisphere - it be spring ; plant are being teach to grow '' . 
`` ' teach to grow '' ' ? 
he hesitate . 
`` person teach plant to grow . 
i have help him . 
but my people - martian , i mean ; i now grok you be my people - teach plant another way . 
in the other hemisphere it is grow cold and nymph , those who stay alive through the summer , are being bring into nest for quickening and more growing '' . 
he think . 
`` of the human we leave at the equator , one has discorporated and the others be sad '' . 
yes , i hear it in the news `` . 
person had not hear it ; he had not know it until ask . 
`` they should not be sad . 
person first_class be not sad ; the person have cherish him '' . 
`` you know him '' ? 
`` yes . 
he have his own face , dark and beautiful . 
but he be homesick '' . 
`` oh , dear ! 
person & & & do you ever get homesick ? 
for mars '' ? 
`` at_first i be homesick '' , he answer . 
`` i be lonely always '' . 
he roll toward her and take her in his arm . 
`` but now i be not lonely . 
i grok i shall never be lonely again '' . 
`` mike darling '' - they kiss , and go_on kiss . 
presently his water_brother say breathlessly . 
`` oh , my ! 
that be almost worse than the first time '' . 
`` you be all_right , my brother '' ? 
`` yes . 
yes indeed . 
kiss me again '' . 
a long_time later , by cosmic clock , she say , `` person ? 
is that - i mean , ' do you know '' ' - 
`` i know . 
it be for grow close . 
now we grow close '' . 
`` well & & & i 've be ready a long_time - goodness , we all have , but & & & never_mind , dear ; turn just a_little . 
i 'll help '' . 
as they merge , grokking together , person say softly and triumphantly : `` thou art god '' . 
her answer be not in word . 
then , as their grokking make them ever close and person feel himself almost ready to discorporate her voice call him back : `` oh ! 
oh ! 
thou art god '' ! 
`` we grok god '' . 
on mars human were build pressure_dome for the male and female party that would arrive by next ship . 
this go fast than schedule as the martian be helpful . 
part of the time save was spend on a preliminary estimate for a long-distance plan to free bound oxygen in the sand of mars to make the planet more friendly to future human generation . 
the old_ones neither help nor hinder this plan ; time be not_yet . 
their meditation were approach a violent cusp that would shape martian art for many millennium .

group and location publish identical denunciation of person 's elevation , group and the group ignore it , group snicker at it , and the group simply report it - the fosterites in england be few but extremely militant . 
person be not pleased with his promotion . 
the person had interrupt him with his work half finished - and that stupid jackass person be certain to louse_up . 
person listen with angelic patience until person ran_down , then say , `` listen , junior , you be an angel now - so forget it .

get happy , junior '' ! 
person heave a deep ethereal sigh . 
`` okay , i'm happy . 
where do i start '' ? 
person did not hear of person 's disappearance when it was announce , and , when he did , while he have a fleeting suspicion , he dismiss it ; if person had had_a_finger_in it , he had gotten_away_with it - and what happen to supreme bishop worry person not at_all as_long_as he was n't bother . 
his household had go_through an upset . 
person deduce what had happen but did not know with whom - and did n't want to inquire . 
person be of legal_age and presumed able to defend himself in the clinch . 
anyhow , it be high_time the boy was salted . 
person could n't reconstruct the crime from the way the girl behave because pattern keep shift - abc vs d , then bcd vs a & & & or ab vs cd , or ad vs cb , through all way that four woman can gang_up on each other . 
this continue most of the week following that ill-starred trip to church , during which period person stay in his room and usually in a trance so deep that person would have pronounce him dead had he not see it before . 
person would not have mind it if service had not go_to_pieces .

absentminded , subject_to unexplained tears . 
person would have bet his life that if person were to witness the second_coming , she would memorize date , time , persona , event , and barometric_pressure without bat her calm blue eye . 
the expense and time involved be astronomical . 
however , we send a third vessel out , a much smaller and fast one than the first two . 
we have learn much about interstellar drive since a_hundred year ago ; that is all i can tell you about them . 
`` but the third ship come_back several year ago and report & & & '' . 
`` that it had find a planet on which human_being could live and which was already inhabit by sentient being '' ! say person , forget in his enthusiasm that he had not been ask to speak . 
person stop pace to stare at person with his pale blue eye . 
`` how did you know '' ? he say sharply . 
`` forgive me , person '' , say person . 
`` but it be inevitable ! 
did not the person predict in his time and the location that such a planet would be find ? 
i believe it be on page 573 '' ! 
person smile and say , `` i be glad that your scriptural lesson have leave such an impression '' . 
how could they not ? 
think person . 
besides , they be not the only impression . 
i still bear scar on my back where person , my gapt , whip me because i had not learn my lesson well enough . 
he be a good impresser , that person . 
was ? 
is ! 
as i grow old and was promote , so was he , always where i be . 
he be my gapt in the creche . 
he be the dormitory gapt when i go_to college and think i was get_away from him . 
he be now my block gapt . 
he be the one responsible_for my get such low m.r. 's . 
swiftly , come the revulsion , the protest . 
no , not he , for i , and i alone , be responsible_for whatever happen to me . 
if i get a low m._r. , i do so because i want it that way or my dark self does . 
if i die , i die because i willed it so . 
so , forgive me , person , for the contrary to reality thought ! 
`` please pardon me again , person '' , say person . 
`` but did the expedition find any record of the person having be on this planet ? 
perhaps , even , though this be too_much to wish , find the person himself '' ? 
`` no '' , say person . 
`` though that does not mean that there may not be such record there . 
the expedition be under order to make a swift survey of condition and_then to return to earth . 
i can n't tell you now the distance in light_year or what star this be , though you can see it with the naked eye at night in this hemisphere . 
if you volunteer , you will be tell where you 're go after the ship leave . 
and it leave very soon '' . 
`` you need a linguist '' ? say person . 
`` the ship be huge '' , say person , `` but the number of military_man and specialist we are take limit the linguist to one . 
we have consider several of your professional because they be lamechians and above suspicion . 
unfortunately & & & '' . 
person wait : person pace some more , frown . 
then , he say , `` unfortunately , only one lamechian linguist exist , and he be too old for this expedition . 
therefore & & & '' . 
`` a_thousand pardon '' , say person . 
`` but i have just think_of one thing . 
i be married '' . 
`` no problem at_all '' , say person . 
`` there will be no woman aboard the gabriel . 
and , if a man be married , he will automatically be give a divorce '' . 
person gasp , and he say , `` a divorce '' ? 
person raise his hand apologetically and say , `` you be horrified , of_course . 
but , from our reading of the western_talmud , we urielites believe that the person , know this situation would arise , make reference to and provision for divorce . 
it 's inevitable in_this case , for the couple will be separate for , at_the_least , forty year . 
naturally , he couch the provision in obscure language . 
in his great and glorious wisdom , he know that our enemy the israelites must not be able to read therein what we plan '' . 
`` i volunteer '' , say person . 
`` tell me more , person '' . 
six month later , person stand in the observation_dome of the gabriel and watch the ball of location dwindle above him . 
it be night on this hemisphere , but the light blaze from the megalopolis of australia , japan , china , location , india , siberia . 
person , the linguist , see the glittering disc and necklace in_terms_of the language speak therein . 
australia , the philippine_islands , japan , and northern china were inhabit by those member of the group that speak american . 
location , all_of southeast asia , southern india and ceylon , these state of the group speak bazaar . 
siberia speak icelandic . 
his mind turn the globe swiftly for him , and he visualize africa , which use swahili south of the location . 
all_around the location , asia_minor , northern india , and tibet , hebrew be the native tongue . 
in southern europe , between the israeli republic and the icelandic-speaking people of northern europe , be a thin but long stretch of territory called location . 
this be no_man's_land , dispute by the group and the group , a potential source of war for the last two hundred year . 
neither nation would give_up their claim on it , yet neither wish to make any move that might lead to a second apocalyptic_war . 
so , for all practical purpose , it be an independent nation and by now have its own organized government ( unrecognized outside its own border ) . 
its citizen speak all_of the world 's surviving tongue , plus a new one called lingo , a pidgin whose vocabulary was derive from the other six and whose syntax be so simple it could be contain on half a sheet_of_paper . 
person see in his mind the rest of earth : iceland , greenland , the caribbean_island , and the eastern half of south_america . 
here the people speak the tongue of iceland because that island had gotten_the_jump_on the hawaiian american who be busy resettle north_america and the western half of south_america after the apocalyptic_war . 
then there be north_america , where american be the native speech of all except the twenty descendant of french_canadian live on the location . 
person know that when that side of earth rotate into the night zone , location would blaze_out into space . 
and , somewhere in_that enormous light , be his apartment . 
but person would soon no_longer be live there , for she would be notify in a_few day that her husband had die in an accident while on a flight to location . 
she would weep in_private , he be sure , for she love him in her frigid way , though in_public she would be dry-eyed . 
her friend and professional associate would sympathize_with her , not because she had lose a beloved husband , but because she had be married to a man who think unrealistically . 
if person had been kill in a crash , he must have want it that way . 
there be no such thing as an `` accident '' . 
somehow , all the other passenger ( also supposed to have die in_this web of elaborate fraud to cover_up the disappearance of the personnel of the gabriel ) had simultaneously `` agree '' to die . 
and , therefore , be in disgrace , they would not be cremate and their ash fling to the wind in public ceremony . 
no , the fish could eat their body for all the group care . 
person feel sorry_for person ; he had_a_time keep the tears from well to his own eye as he stand in the crowd in the observation_dome . 
yet , he tell himself , this be the best way . 
he and person would no_longer have to tear and rend at each other ; their mutual torture would be over . 
person be free to marry again , not know that the group had secretly give her a divorce , think that death had dissolve her marriage . 
she would have a year in which to make_up_one's_mind her mind , to choose a mate from a list select by her gapt . 
perhaps , the psychological barrier that had prevent her from conceive person 's child would no_longer be present . 
perhaps . 
person doubt if this happy event would occur . 
person be as frozen below the navel as he . 
no_matter who the candidate for marriage select by the gapt . 
the gapt . 
person . 
he would no_longer have to see that fat face , hear that whining voice . 
`` person '' ! say the whining voice . 
and , slowly , feel himself icy yet burning , person turn . 
there be the squat loose-jowled man , smile lopsidedly up at him . 
`` my beloved ward , my perennial gadfly '' , say the whining voice . 
`` i have no idea that you , too , would be on this glorious voyage . 
but i might have know ! 
we seem to be bound by love ; person himself must have foresee it . 
love to you , my ward '' . 
`` person love you , too , my guardian '' , say person , choke . 
`` how wonderful to see your cherished self . 
i had think we would never again speak_to each other '' . 
the gabriel point towards her destination and , under one gee acceleration , begin to build_up towards her ultimate velocity , 99.1 percent of the speed_of_light . 
meanwhile , all the personnel except those few needed to carry_out the performance of the ship , go_into the suspensor . 
here they would lie in suspended_animation for many year . 
some time later , after a check had been make of all automatic equipment , the crew would join the others . 
they would sleep while the gabriel 's drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen body of the personnel could not have endure . 
upon reach the desired speed , the automatic equipment would cut_off the drive , and the silent but not empty vessel would hurl towards the star which be its journey 's end . 
many year later , the photon counting apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star be close enough to actuate deceleration . 
again , a force too strong for unfrozen body to endure would be apply . 
then , after slow the vessel considerably , the drive would adjust to a one gee deceleration . 
and the crew would be automatically bring_out of their suspended_animation . 
these member would then unthaw the rest of the personnel . 
and , in the half year left before reach their destination , the men would carry_out whatever preparation be needed . 
person be among the last to go_into the suspensor and among the first to come_out . 
he had to study the recording of the language of the chief nation of ozagen , siddo . 
and , from the first , he face a difficult task . 
the expedition that had discover ozagen had succeed in correlate two thousand siddo word with an equal number of american word . 
the description of the siddo syntax be very restricted . 
and , as person find_out , obviously mistaken in many case . 
this discovery cause person anxiety . 
his duty be to write a school_text and to teach the entire personnel of the gabriel how to speak ozagen . 
yet , if he use all_of the little means at his disposal , he would be instruct his student wrongly . 
moreover , even get_across this across would be difficult . 
for_one_thing , the organ of speech of the ozagen native differ somewhat from earthman 's ; the sound make by these organ be , therefore , dissimilar . 
it was true that they could be approximate , but would the ozagenians understand these approximation ? 
another obstacle be the grammatical construction of siddo . 
consider the tense_system . 
instead of inflect a verb or use an unattached particle to indicate the past or future , siddo use an entirely different word . 
thus , the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigalu'ahai , mean to live , be , in the perfect_tense , ksu'u'peli'afo , and , in the future , mai'teipa . 
the same use of an entirely different word apply for all the other tense . 
plus the fact that siddo not_only have the normal ( to earthman ) three gender of masculine , feminine , and neuter , but the two extra of inanimate and spiritual . 
fortunately , gender be inflected , though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not bear in siddo . 
the system of indicate gender vary according to tense . 
all the other part_of_speech : noun , pronoun , adjective , adverb , and conjunction operate under the same system as the verb . 
she was carry a quirt , and she start to raise it , then let it fall again and dangle from her wrist . 
`` i see your fire '' , she say , speak slowly , make an effort to control her anger . 
`` you could burn_down this whole mountainside with a fire that size . 
it would n't matter_to a fool like you . 
it would to me '' . 
`` all_right '' , person say quickly . 
`` the fire 's too big . 
and i appreciate the advice '' . 
he was lose patience again . 
an hour before , with the child asleep and nothing but the strange darkness , he would have appreciate company . 
she had help him change his mind . 
`` i'm not advise you '' , she say . 
`` i'm tell you . 
that fire 's too big . 
let it burn_down . 
and make_sure it 's out when you leave in the morning '' . 
he was take_aback . 
it take him a long_time to compose himself . 
`` there 's some mistake '' , he say finally . 
`` you 're right about the fire . 
it 's bigger than it has to be , though i do n't see where it 's do any harm . 
but you 're wrong about the rest of_it . 
i'm not leave in the morning . 
why should i ? 
i own the place '' . 
she show her surprise by tighten the rein and move_around the gelding around so that she could get a better look at his face . 
it did n't seem to tell her anything . 
she glance around the clearing , take_in the wagon and the load of supplies and trapping scattered over the ground , the two kid , the whiteface bull that was chew its cud just within the far reach of the firelight . 
she study it for a long_time . 
then she turn_back to person and smile , and he be n't quite sure what she mean by it . 
`` you own this place '' ? she say , and her tone had soften until it be almost friendly . 
`` you buy it '' ? 
`` from a man in st._louis '' , person say . 
`` person . 
maybe you know him '' . 
the girl laugh . 
`` i know him . 
i ought to . 
my father run_off him off here six year ago '' . 
person did n't say anything . 
he stand watch the girl , wonder what was come next . 
she had pick_up the quirt and was twirl it around her wrist and smile at him . 
`` person did n't tell you that '' , she say . 
`` no '' , person say . 
`` but it 's understandable . 
it 's not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of . 
and it does n't make any difference . 
he sell me a clear title . 
i have it with me , right here . 
if you want to see '' - 
`` never_mind '' , she say sternly . 
`` it would n't matter_to my father , and not to me . 
i mean what i say about that fire . 
be sure it 's out when you leave . 
that 's all . 
i 'll let you go_back to do the dish now '' . 
it was mean to insult him , and did n't quite succeed . 
he take the rein just below the bit and hold them firmly , and it was his turn to smile now . 
`` i do n't mind wash dish now_and_then '' , he say pleasantly . 
`` it does n't hurt . 
it might hurt you , though . 
somebody might mistake you for a woman '' . 
he mean to say more , but he never get the chance . 
she be quick . 
she bring_down the quirt down , slash it across his cheek , and he try to step back . 
she swing the quirt again , and this time he catch her wrist and pull her out of the saddle . 
she come_down against him , and he try to break her fall . 
he grab her by the shoulder and go_down on one knee , taking her weight so that some of the wind was drive out of him . 
it make him a_little sick , and he let_go_of her . 
he get_up slowly , and she be already on her feet , and he stand face her . 
he wipe the blood from his cheek . 
`` i ought to '' - he say . 
he was shake with anger , his breath come in long , painful gasp . 
`` that quirt - i ought to use it on you , where it would do the most good . 
if you be a man '' - 
`` she be n't , mister '' . 
the voice come from behind him , and person turn . 
the fire had go_down , and the man be only a shadow against the tree . 
but a moment later he bring_forward his horse forward into the light , and person have a good look at him . 
he be tall and dark-skinned , a half-breed , person think . 
and he be handsome , despite the long thin scar that slant across his cheek . 
`` she 's not a man , mister '' , he say . 
`` i be . 
if you 've got any idea '' . 
he raise the winchester and point it at person 's chest . 
`` put_down the rifle down , person '' , the girl say . 
she seem irritate . 
`` i think i tell you to stay home '' . 
the half-breed ease the winchester down and rest it across his lap . 
the scar look pure white in the half darkness ; his eye be black and deep-set , and expressionless . 
`` you should n't be ride up_here after dark , person '' , he say quietly . 
`` i can take_care of this . 
it 's no job for you '' . 
the girl tap the quirt impatiently against her knee and glare at him . 
he take it without flinch . 
`` i say go_home , person . 
you 've got no business up_here '' . 
the half-breed did n't answer this time . 
but the scar seem to pull hard at the corner of his mouth , and his eye be hurt and angry . 
it make person wonder . 
he watch the half-breed as he turn silently . 
they could hear the pony 's foot on the dry leaf for_a_while , then the sound fade_out . 
person brush the dust from his coat . 
`` who be that '' ? he ask . 
`` your personal guard ? 
you 're pretty hard on him '' . 
`` he work for my father '' , the girl say , and_then seem to change her mind . 
`` he 's a friend . 
his name 's person . 
is there anything else you want to know '' ? 
`` not now '' , person say . 
`` i guess i 'll find_out soon_enough . 
you 've got blood on your cheek . 
not yours . 
mine . 
it must have got there when you fall against me '' . 
she wipe_off it off with the sleeve of her coat . 
`` i 'll bet that 's as_close_as you 've be to a man since you be a baby '' , person say . 
he see her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt , and he grab her wrist . 
`` oh , no '' , he say , and he be without humor now . 
`` i 've have enough of_that . 
i 've have enough of you . 
i do n't know what go_on around here , and i do n't care . 
i do n't know what make you think you can get_away with this kind_of business , and i do n't care about that , either . 
you take me by surprise . 
but i 'll know how to handle you next time '' . 
she bring_up her free hand to hit him , but this time he be quicker . 
he sidestep her blow and she fall , stumble against the gelding . 
she finally regain her balance and get_up in the saddle . 
her hat had come_off and fall behind her shoulder , hold by the string , and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before . 
he had forget that she be so pretty . 
but her prettiness be what he had notice first , and all the other thing had come afterward : 
cruelty , meanness , self-will . 
he had know woman like that , one woman in_particular . 
and one had be too many . 
he watch the girl until she had go_into the tree , and wait until he could n't hear the sound of her horse any long , then go_up to where the child were sleep . 
they were n't sleep , of_course , but they think they were do him a favor by pretend . 
he had n't show_up too well in their eyes , let himself be browbeat by a woman . 
they expect greater thing from him , regardless of how trying the circumstance , and they be disappointed . 
and determined not to show it . 
they lie a_little too stiffly , with their eye strain to stay closed . 
`` go_to_sleep '' , he say . 
`` both of you . 
there 's better thing to do than listen to something like that . 
i 'll be down at the creek finish the dish , if you want me '' . 
he find the pan where he had drop it and carry it back down to the stream . 
the coyote was call again , and he hope that this time there would be no other sound to interrupt it . 
not tonight , at_any_rate . 
he have a feeling that the girl mean trouble . 
if she did , he could stand it better in the light . 
he scrub absentmindedly at the pan and reflect on how thing had turn_out . 
that afternoon when they had pull_up in_front_of the broken-down ranch_house , his hope had be high . 
already some of the pain had go from person 's death . 
not all_of it . 
there would still be plenty of moment of regret and sadness and guilty relief . 
but they were start a new life . 
and they have almost everything they needed : land , a house , two whiteface bull , three horse . 
the land be n't all person had expect of_it . 
six hundred and forty acres , the old_man back in st._louis had say ; good grass , good water . 
well , the grass be there , though in some place the ground be too steep for a cow to get to it . 
the water be there , so much of_it that it spread all_through the dead orchard . 
and there was a house ; livable perhaps , but badly in_need_of repair . 
in_the_last_analysis , though , person have little cause to complain . 
the place had be cheap - just the little he have left after person 's burial - and it would serve its purpose . 
there be only one place where person 's description had go badly awry : the peace and quiet . 
it had n't start_out that way . 
and he have a feeling - thanks to the girl - that thing would get worse before they get better . 
they had the house clean_up by noon , and person send the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horse . 
he stand on the porch and watch him struggle with the heavy harness , and finally go over to help him . 
person be already in the wagon . 
they were go_to town , and they be both excited . 
person back the team into the trace , and wish they were n't go_to town at_all . 
he have an uneasy feeling about it . 
that girl last night , what be her name ? 
person . 
it be the only thing about her that be the_least_bit hard to remember . 
he finish with the team and fill his pipe and stand look about him . 
he had spend two hour ride around the ranch that morning , and in broad daylight it be even less inviting than person had make it seem . 
there be brush , and stand of pine that no grass could grow under , and place so steep that cattle would n't stop to graze . 
but there be water . 
there be an artificial_lake just out_of_sight in the first stand of tree , feed by a half dozen spring that pop_out of the ground above the hillside orchard . 
yes , there be plenty of water , too_much , and that be probably the trouble . 
there be track of cattle all_over his six hundred and forty acres . 
the first part of the road be steep , but it level_off after the second bend and curl gradually into the valley . 
it be hot once they reach the flat , and dry , but the grass be better . 
a warm breeze play across it , move it like wave . 
a red-tailed_hawk fly in behind them and stay there , watch for any snake or rabbit that they might stir_up from the side of the road . 
it take them an hour before they come to the first house of location . 
the town be about what person expect : one main_street with its row of false-fronted building , a water_tower , a_few warehouse , a single hotel ; all dusty and sunbaked . 
the place be quiet . 
they neither like nor dislike the old_man . 
to them he could have be the broken bell in the church_tower which ring before and after mass , and at noon , and at six each evening - its tone , repetitive , monotonous , never break the boredom of the street . 
the old_man be unimportant . 
yet if he be not there , they would have miss him , as they would have miss the sound of bee buzz against the screen_door in early june ; or the smell of thick tomato_paste - the ripe smell that be both sweet and sour - rise_up from aluminum tray wrapped in fly dotted cheesecloth . 
or the surging whirling sound of bat at night , when their black body dive into the blackness above and below the amber streetlight . 
or the bay of female dog in heat . 
they never call him by name , although he have one . 
person , that 's what he be called in the old_country ; but here he be just signore or the old_man . 
but this be not unusual , because youth in these quarter was always push at a distance from its elder . 
youth obey when command . 
it go_to church on sunday and one saturday a month go_to confession . 
but youth ask nothing of its parent - not a touch of the hand or a kiss give in_passing . 
the only thing unusual about the old_man had long_since happen . 
but the past be dead here as the present be dead . 
once the old_man had have a wife . 
and once she , too , ignore him . 
with a tiny fur-piece wrapped around her shoulder , she wiggle her satin covered buttocks down the street before him and did n't stop . 
in one hand she clutch a hundred_dollar_bill and in the other a straw suitcase . 
the way she strut down the street , the old_man would have be blind not to have notice both . 
without look at him , without look at anything except location directly in_front of her , she climb_up into one of those orange streetcar , ride_away in it , and never come_back . 
`` but she should n't have come here in_the_first_place '' , the woman had say . 
`` no , no . 
not that one . 
she think she be big than we be because she come from location '' . 
`` eh , location ! 
she give herself fancy airs ! 
just because she have a part on_the_stage in the old_country , she think she could carry her head high than ours '' . 
they had slap their thigh . 
`` it 's not for make pretty speech about dante those actress get pay so good '' . 
`` henh '' ! 
calloused finger , caress only by the smoothness of polished rosary , had sway excitedly beneath puckered chin where tiny black hair sprout , never to be tweeze away . 
mauve colored mouth that had never know anything sweet than the taste of new wine and the passion of man 's tongue had not smile , but had condemn again_and_again . 
`` puttana '' ! 
but if the old_man even think_about his wife now , nobody cared_a_fig . 
it was enough for people to know that at_one_time he had look down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman he had consume - watch her become thin and thin in the distance , as thin as the seam on her stocking , and still thin . 
his voice had not command her to stop . 
it had not question why . 
the woman say they had see him wave an exhausted farewell ; but he might have been shoo_away the flea that hop from his yellow dog onto him . 
( he be never without that dog . ) 
and his eye - those miniature sundial of variegated yellow - had not alter their expression or direction . 
the old_man 's very soul could have leave him and fly down that street , but he would n't have had anyone know it . 
perhaps he had know then where that hundred_dollar_bill had come from and where it was take his wife . 
but when he call_for his withered , wrinkled sister person to care for him and the child , had he guess that all he would remember of his woman be the memory of her climb into that streetcar ? 
there seem to be a contemptuous purpose in the way he sit there with his eye glue to location and his back in_opposition to the church behind him . 
for all he see or care to see , this could have been a town in italy , not the outskirts of philadelphia . 
it could have been location or location for the way it smell . 
what did it matter_to him that the park at the foot of location stretch beneath elevated train that roar from the stucco station into the city 's center at half-hour interval ? 
or that the tiny creek spin its silent course toward the location ? 
this place be hatred to him , just as hatred be his only companion in his aloneness . 
to him they be one_and_the_same . 
sameness for the old_man was frame_in by a wall of ginkgo tree which divide these quarter from the city . 
sameness line the street with two story house the color of ash . 
it slash the sloping manure scented lawn with concrete steps which climb upward to white wooden porch . 
it sway with the wicker swing and screech with the rusted hinge of screen_door . 
even the stable garage , which house nothing now but the scent of rot , have a lawn before it . 
and the coffee_shop on location , where the man spend their evening and sunday play card , have a rose hedge beneath its window . 
the hedge reek of coffee dregs throw against it . 
only one house on the street have no lawn before it . 
it squat low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron grating support a glass facade . 
that be person 's shop . 
above it , from a second story showroom , wooden angel survey the neighborhood . 
did the old_man remember them there ? 
yet everywhere else sameness be stucco and wood in square_block - like fortress perch against the slant of the hill , rise with the hill to the top where the church be and beyond that to the cemetery . 
only paved alleyway tunnel through the wall of those fortress into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the house where backyard own no fence , where one man 's property blend with the next to form courtyard in which no one know privacy . 
love and hatred and fear be one here , shaded only by fig_tree and grapevine . 
and the forked tongue of gossip lick its sinister way from back_porch to back_porch . 
the old_man silently feed_upon these street . 
they keep him alive , wait . 
wait for what and for whom , only he could tell and would not . 
it was as though he had make a pact with the devil himself , but it be not_yet time to pay the price . 
he was hold_out for something . 
he was determined to hold_out . 
the old_man 's son throw himself down , belly first , upon a concrete step , take_in the coolness of it , and dream of the day he would be rich . 
at fifteen he did n't care that he have no mother , that he could n't remember her face or her touch ; neither did he care that person provide for him . 
he was name person as a tribute to his heritage , and he could n't have care less about that either . 
to him life be a restless boredom that begin with the rising sun and end only with sleep . 
when he would be a man , he would be a rich_man . 
he would not be like the `` rich american '' who live in white columned house on the other side of the park . 
he would not ride the eight-thirty local to the city each morning . 
he would not carry a briefcase . 
nor would he work at_all . 
he would square his shoulder and carry a cane before each step . 
he would sit inside the coffee_shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come run , bow with her running , call_out in her bow , `` at your service '' . 
he would order her to bring coffee , and would take from his vest_pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff - he would not remove his gloves - and light and smoke . 
he could do that when he would be a man . 
`` hey , person '' ! he call to his sister on the porch above the steps . 
she be only ten month older than he . 
`` person , what would you say if i smoke a pipe '' ? 
person did not answer him . 
she lean unconcerned against the broken porch fence , brush and dry her wet , gilded hair in the sun . 
one lithe leg straddle the railing and swing loosely before the creaking , torn pale . 
her tanned foot , whose arch sweep high and white , point artfully toward tapering toe - toe like finger , whose tip glow white . 
all the while she sit there , her sinewy arm swirl before her chest . 
her face show no sign of having hear person . 
it be a face that had lose its childlike softness and was begin to fold within its fragile feature a harshness that belie the lyric line of its contour . 
the eye , blue and always somewhat downcast , possess a sullen quality . 
even_though the boy could not see them , he know they were cloud by distance . 
he be never sure they fully take_in him in . 
person call again , `` person '' ! 
but the only answer that reach him be the screech of the porch rail from her leg move against it . 
`` she 's in_a_mood '' , he think `` there 's not a month she does n't get herself in_a_mood '' . 
well , what did that matter when the sun was shine and there be dream to dream about ? 
and as for his pipe , if he want to smoke one , nobody would stop him . 
not even person . 
suddenly he was interrupt in his daydream by a warm wetness lap against his chin , and his eye open wide and long at the sight of a goat 's claret tongue , feast against the salt taste of him . 
above the tongue , an aged yellow eye , sallow and time-cast , encrust within a sphere of marbleized pink skin , stare unfalteringly at him . 
`` christ_sake , goat , git '' ! 
but the goat would not . 
`` you 're boil milk , ai n't you '' ? soothe it with his hand , know the whiskered jowl and the swollen smoothness of teat that wrinkle expectantly to his touch . 
person roll_over . 
his head undulate gradually , cover space , to come strain beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teat . 
with his mouth open wide , he squirt the warm white milk against the roof_of_the_mouth of his mouth and his tongue savor the light , earthy taste of it . 
the boy 's finger and mouth operate with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player , press and pull , delight in what he do . 
above him slide the evasive shadow of a storm_cloud . 
its form be a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane . 
but the boy could see only the goat 's belly . 
the old_man near the corner let the shadow pass_over him , sense something portentous in it . 
he know it be there , know also what it be about , but he would n't raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog 's back . 
there would be time enough , perhaps the old_man reassure himself , to pay the devil his due . 
time enough to give_up his soul . 
in_the_meantime , six sandal , stained an ocher , the same color as person 's shaved hair , edge_up close to him . 
the clapping they make on the concrete interrupt him in the ecstatic pleasure he know , so that he quickly release his hold on the goat and pretend to be examine its haunch for tick . 
he know at a glance that the biggest sandal belong to person , the neat ones to person , and the laced ones to person , person 's idiot brother . 
person expect person 's small body to sink close and close to the ground . 
he expect person 's thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy , and her shrill , impetuous voice to sound against the rotundity of his disfigured flesh that be never sure of hear anything . 
nothing in english has been ridicule as_much_as the ambiguous use of word , unless it be the ambiguous use of sentence . 
person say , `` clearly speak , person . 
you explain english by greek '' . 
person say , `` i think the interpreter be the hard to be understand of the two '' . 
and a witty american journalist remark over a century ago what be even more true today , `` many_a writer seem to think he be never profound except when he can n't understand his own meaning '' . 
there be many type of ambiguity and many_of them have been describe by rhetorician under such name as amphibology , parisology , and other ology . 
in common parlance they would be describe as miss - misinterpreters , misunderstanders , misdirectors and kindred misdeed . 
one species of ambiguity try to baffle by interweave repetition . 
`` did you or did you not say what i say you say , because person say you never say what i say '' ? 
another woman , address christmas_card , say to her husband : `` we send them one last year but they did n't send us one , so they probably won't send us one this year because they 'll think we won't send them one because they did n't last year , do n't you think , or shall we '' ? 
such ambiguous exercise compound confusion by make it worse compound , and they are sometimes expand until the cream of the jest sour . 
ambiguity of a non repetitious kind describe the dilemma one girl find herself in . 
`` i'm terribly upset '' , she tell a girlfriend . 
`` i write person in my last letter to forget that i had tell him that i did n't mean to reconsider my decision not to change my mind - and he seem to have misunderstand me '' . 
evidently person be another of those man who simply do n't understand woman . 
another case involve a newspaper reporter who trip_up a politician . 
`` person , you may recall that we print last week your denial of having retract the contradiction of your original statement . 
now would you care to have us say that you were misquote in regard_to it '' ? 
question like this , frame in verbal fog , be perhaps the only kind that have ever stump an experienced politician . 
they recall person 's classic comment : `` i wish he would explain his explanation '' . 
similarly , when a reporter once question person in cryptic fashion , person refuse to make any further statement . 
`` i fear explanation explanatory of thing explain '' , he say , leave the biter bit - and bitter . 
the obscurity of politician may_not always be as innocent as it look . 
`` senator '' , say an interviewer , `` your constituent can n't understand from your speech last night just how you stand on the question '' . 
`` good '' ! 
reply the senator . 
`` it take me five hour to write it that way '' . 
the misplaced modifier be another species more honored in the observance of obscurity than in the breach . 
this create an amusing effect because its position in a sentence seem to make it apply to the wrong word . 
a verse familiar to all grammarian be the quatrain : 
`` i see a man once beat his wife when on a drunken spree . 
now can you tell me who be drunk - the man , his wife , or me '' ? 
the `` wooden_leg '' gag of vaudeville , another standby of this sort , have endless variation . 
`` '' there 's a man outside with a wooden_leg named person `` . 
'' what 's the name of his other leg `` '' ? 
another stock vaudeville gag run : `` mother be home sick in bed with the doctor '' . 
when radio come_in , it continue the misplaced modifier in its routine as a standard device . 
`` '' do you see that pretty girl stand next to the car with slacks on `` ? 
'' i see the girl but i do n't see the car with slacks on `` '' . 
in recent year gagwriter have discover this brand of blunder and thus the misplaced modifier has acquire a new habitat in the gag_line . 
in one cartoon a family is show outside a theater with the head of the family address the doorman : `` excuse me , but when we come_out we find that we had leave my daughter 's handbag and my wife 's behind '' . 
journalism supply us with an endless run of such slip . 
not long_ago a newspaper advise those take_part in a contest that `` snapshot must be of a person not larger than * * f inch '' . 
classified ad be also chockful of misrelated construction . 
reader of the reader_'s_digest be familiar_with such item which often appear in its list of verbal slip , like the ad in a california paper that advertise `` house for rent . 
view take_in five county , two bedroom '' . 
since brevity be the soul of ambiguity as_well as wit , newspaper headline continually provide us with amusing sample . 
`` official meet on rubbish . 
many shape in bathtub . 
son and daughter of local couple marry '' . 
apart from misplaced modifier and headlinese , journalism contribute a wide variety of comic ambiguity in both editorial and advertising matter . 
a weekly newspaper report a local romance : `` and the couple were marry last saturday , thus end a friendship which begin in their schooldays '' . 
an item in the letter column of a newspaper renew a subscription , add : `` i personally enjoy your newspaper as_much_as my husband '' . 
then there be the caterer 's ad which read : `` are you get_married or have an affair ? 
we have complete facility to accommodate 200 people '' . 
the newspaper too be the favorite habitat of the anatomical . 
this slip be so-called because its semi ambiguous english always seem to refer to a person 's anatomy but never quite mean what it seem to say . 
sample : 
he walk in upon her invitation . 
she kiss him passionately upon his reappearance . 
he kiss her back . 
not without good reason has the anatomical be called jocular journalese . 
in news item a man is less often shoot in the body or head than in the suburb . 
`` while person was escort person from the church social last saturday night , a savage dog attack them and bite person on the public_square '' . 
such item recall the california journalist who report an accident involve a movie_star : `` the area in which person - was injure be spectacularly scenic '' . 
the double meaning in the anatomical make it a familiar vaudeville device , as in the gag of person and person . 
when a witness at court was ask if he had been kick in the ensue rumpus , he reply , `` no , it be in the stomach '' . 
strangely_enough , this always brought_the_house_down . 
apart from journalese and vaudeville gag , the anatomical is also find in jocular literature . 
a conscientious girl become the secretary of a doctor . 
her first day at work she was puzzle by an entry in the doctor 's note on an emergency case . 
it read : `` shoot in the lumbar region '' . 
after a moment of thought , her mind clear and , in the interest of clarity , she type into the record : `` shoot in the woods '' . 
there be many grammatical misconstruction other_than dangling_modifier and anatomical which permit two different interpretation . 
at the home of a gourmet the new maid was instruct in the fine point of serve . 
`` i want the fish serve whole , with head and tail '' , the epicure explain , `` and serve it with lemon in mouth '' . 
the maid demur . 
`` that 's silly - lemon in mouth '' , she say . 
but since the gourmet insist that it is do that way at_the_most fashionable dinner , the girl reluctantly agree . 
so she bring the fish in whole , and she carry a lemon in her mouth . 
another specimen of such double_entendre is illustrate by a woman in a department_store . 
she say to the saleslady , `` i want a dress to put_on around the house '' . 
the puzzled saleslady inquire , `` how large be your house , madam '' ? 
this saleslady be a failure in the dress department and was transfer to the shoe department . 
when a customer ask for alligator shoe , she say , `` what size be your alligator '' ? 
the comic indefinite comprise an extensive class of comedy . 
one species is restrict to statement which be neither explicit nor precise regard a particular person , place , time or thing . 
a woman meet a famous author at a literary tea . 
`` oh , i'm so delight to meet you '' , she gush . 
`` it be only the other day that i see something of yours , about something or other , in some magazine '' . 
this baffling lack of distinct detail recall the secretary whose employer was leave the office and tell her what to answer if anyone call in his absence . 
`` i may be back '' , he explain , `` and then_again , i may_not '' . 
the girl nod understandingly . 
`` yes , sir '' , she say , `` is that definite '' ? 
an old-fashioned mother say to her modern daughter , `` you must have get_in quite late last night , dear . 
where be you '' ? 
the daughter reply , `` oh , i have dinner with - well , you do n't know him but he 's awfully nice - and we go_to a_couple_of place - i do n't suppose you 've hear of them - and we finish_up at a cute little nightclub - i forget the name of it . 
why , it 's all_right , be n't it , mother '' ? 
her woolly minded parent agree . 
`` of_course , dear '' , she say . 
`` it 's only that i like to know where you go '' . 
no less ambiguous be the indefinity of a certain clergyman 's sermon . 
`` dearly beloved '' , he preach , `` unless you repent of your sin in a measure , and become convert to a degree , you will , i regret to say , be damned to a more_or_less extent '' . 
this clergyman should have refer to person 's dictum : `` so-so be a good , very good , very excellent maxim . 
and yet it be not . 
it be but so-so '' . 
indefinite reference also carry double meaning where an allusion to one person or thing seem to refer to another . 
a news item describe the launching of a ship : `` complete the ceremony , the beautiful movie_star smash a bottle of champagne over her stern as she slide gracefully down the ways into the sea '' . 
this be not unlike the order receive by the sergeant of an army motor_pool : `` four truck to location gym , 7 : 30 tonight , for haul girl to dance . 
the body must be clean and seat wipe_off '' . 
a politician was approach by a man seek the office of a minor public official who had just die . 
`` what be my chance for take person 's place '' ? he ask . 
`` if you can fix_up it up with the undertaker '' , return the politician , `` it 's all_right with me '' . 
the manager of a movie_theater receive a telephone_call from a woman who be equally indefinite . 
`` what have you got_on today '' ? she inquire . 
`` a blue suit '' , he answer . 
`` who 's in it '' ? she continue . 
`` i be '' , he say . 
there be a short pause for reflection . 
`` oh '' , say the woman , `` i 've see that picture already '' . 
another brand of indefinite reference arise out of the use of the double verb . 
when a question contain two verb , the response does not make clear which of them is being answer . 
the moonlit night was make_for romance , and he had been look at her soulfully for some time . 
finally he ask , `` do you object to petting '' ? 
`` that 's one thing i 've never do '' , she say promptly . 
he think a moment , then inquire , `` you mean pet '' ? 
`` no '' , she smile , `` object '' . 
reply to request for character reference be notorious for their evasive double_entendre . 
it would be hard to find anything more equivocal than : `` i cannot recommend him too highly '' . 
another less ambiguous case read as_follows : `` the bearer of_this letter has serve me for two year to his complete satisfaction . 
if you are think_of give him a berth , be sure to make it a wide one '' . 
in the comedy of indefinite reference , it wit occupy a prominent place because of its frequent occurrence . 
ambiguity arise when the pronoun it carry a twofold reference . 
two friend were talk . 
one say , `` when i get a cold i buy a bottle of whiskey for it , and within a_few hour it 's gone '' . 
the speaker refer to the whiskey but his friend think he mean the cold . 
it wit be a misnomer because it cover slip as_well as wit . 
an excited woman was make an emergency call over the phone : `` doctor , please come over right_away . 
my husband be in great pain . 
i call the other afternoon on my old friend , person , the anglo-american literary critic - his mother be_born in ohio - who live alone in a fairytale cottage on the location , raise_hell and peacock , the former only when the venerable gentleman become an angry old_man about the state of literature or something else that is dwindle and diminish , such_as human stature , hope , and humor . 
my unscientific friend does not believe that human stature be measurable in_terms_of speed , momentum , weightlessness , or distance from earth , but be a matter of the development of the human mind . 
after person become the great man in the world , for a nation that does not believe_in the cult_of_personality or in careerism , person write me a letter in which he say : `` i am not interest in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly . 
a bee 's place be in the hive '' . 
`` i have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy '' , i tell him , at which he start slightly , and_then make us each a stiff drink , with a trembling hand . 
`` i seem to remember '' , he say , `` that in an interview ten year ago you give humor and comedy five year to live . 
did you go_to their funeral '' ? 
`` i be wrong '' , i admit . 
`` comedy did n't die , it just go crazy . 
it has identify itself with the very tension and terror it once did so much to alleviate . 
we now have not_only what has been call over here the comedy of menace but we also have horror joke , magazine known as horror_comics , and sick comedian . 
there are even publication called group and mad . 
the person be not crazy as a loon or mad as a march hare ; it be manic as a man '' . 
`` i wake_up this morning '' , person say , `` paraphrase person . 
do you want to hear the paraphrase '' ? 
`` can i bear it '' ? 
i ask , take a final gulp of my drink , and hand him the empty glass . 
`` just barely '' , he say , and repeat his paraphrase : 
`` the time has come '' , the walrus say , `` to speak of manic thing , of shot and shout , and seal doom of commoner and king '' . 
person fix us each another drink , and say , `` for god 's sake , tell me something truly amusing '' . 
`` i 'll try '' , i say , and sit for a moment think . 
`` oh yes , the other day i reread some of person 's english_traits , and there be an anecdote about a group of english and american visit germany , more_than a_hundred year ago . 
in the railway_station at berlin , a uniformed attendant was chant , ' foreigner this way ! 
foreigner this way ' ! 
one woman - she could have be either english or american - go_up to him and say , ' but you be the foreigner '' ' . 
i take_a_breath a deep breath and an even deep swallow of my drink , and say , `` i admit that go back to person for humor be like go_to a modern musical_comedy for music and comedy '' . 
`` what 's the_matter with the music '' ? 
person ask . 
`` it does n't drown_out the dialogue '' , i explain . 
`` let 's talk_about book '' , person say . 
`` i am tell that in america you have non book by non writer , bring_out by non publisher for non reader . 
is it all nonfiction '' ? 
`` there be nonfiction and non nonfiction '' , i say . 
`` speak of nonism : the other day , in a story about a sit-down demonstration , the paris_herald_tribune write , ' the non violence become noisy ' . 
and_then person was quote as say , in non english , that person 's plan to exterminate the jew be nonsense '' . 
`` if we cannot tell evil , horror , and insanity from nonsense , what be the future of humor and comedy '' ? 
person ask , grimly . 
`` cryptic '' , i say . 
`` they require , for existence , a brave spirit and a high heart , and where do you find these ? 
in our present era of science and angst , the heart has been downgrade , to use one of our popular retrogressive verb '' . 
`` i know what you mean '' , person sigh . 
`` last year your person tell our person , in a television_program , that it is the task of the playwright to throw light into the dark corner of the human heart . 
like almost everybody else , he confuse the heart , both as organ and as symbol , with the disturbed psyche , the deranged gland , and the jumpy central_nervous_system . 
i'm not plead for the heart that leap up when it behold a rainbow in the sky , or for the heart that with rapture fill and dance with the daffodil . 
the sentimental pure heart of person is go with the knightly year , but i still believe_in the heart of the person character that was not make of the stuff that break '' . 
`` we no_longer have person 's and person 's ' heart for any fate ' , either '' , i say . 
`` person and person did n't have the fate that face us '' , person say . 
`` one day our species promise coexistence , and the next day it threaten co_extinction '' . 
we sit for_a_while drink in silence . 
`` the heart '' , i say finally , `` be now either in the throat or the mouth or the stomach or the shoe . 
when it was wear in the breast , or even on the sleeve , we at_least know where it be '' . 
there be a long silence . 
`` you have visit england five time in the past quarter-century , i believe '' , my host say . 
`` what has impress you most on your present visit '' ? 
`` i would say depress , not impress '' , i tell him . 
`` i should say it be the turning of court of law into veritable theatre for sex drama , involve clergyman and parishioner , psychiatrist and patient . 
it is become hard and hard to tell law court and political_arena from the modern theatre '' . 
`` do you think we need a new person to re-explore the anglo-american scene '' ? he ask . 
`` or perhaps a new person '' ? 
`` but you must have hear it say that the drawing_room disappear forever with the somnolent year of person and the antic heyday of person . 
i myself hear it say constantly - in drawing_room . 
in them , there be usually a group of anglo-american with tragicomic problem , worthy of being explore either in the novel or in the play or in comedy and satire '' . 
i stand_up and begin pace . 
`` if you are try to get_out us out of the brothel , the dustbin , the kitchen_sink , and the tawdry living_room , you are probably waste your time '' , person tell me . 
`` too many of our writer seem to be interest only in creature that crawl out of the woodwork or from under the rock '' . 
`` furious and furious '' , i say . 
`` i am worry about the current meaning of the word ' funny ' . 
it now mean ominous , as when one speak of a funny sound in the motor ; disturbing , as when one say that a friend is act funny ; and frightening , as when a wife tell the police that it is funny , but her husband has n't be home for two day and night '' . 
person sit brood for a full minute , during which i make each of us a new drink . 
he take his glass , clink it against mine , and say , `` toujours gai , what_the_hell '' ! borrow a line from person ' mehitabel . 
`` be careful of the word ' gay ' , for it , too , has undergo a change . 
it now mean , in my country , homosexual '' , i say . 
`` oh , i forget to say that if one is take to the funny_house in the funny_wagon , he is remove to a mental_institution in an ambulance . 
recently , by_the_way , i receive a questionnaire in which i was ask whether or not i was non institutionalized '' . 
my host go_over and stare out the window at his peacock ; then he turn_to me . 
`` is it true that you believe the other animal be sane than the human species '' ? 
`` oh , that is demonstrable '' , i tell him . 
`` do you remember the woman in the location who be all alone with her sheep one day when the sun darken ominously ? 
she tell the sheep , ' the world is come to an end ' ! 
and the sheep say - all in_unison , i have no_doubt - ' ba-a-a ' ! 
the sound mockery of sheep be like the salubrious horselaugh '' . 
`` that is only partly non nonsense '' , he begin . 
`` if you see the drama called rhinoceros '' , i say , `` think_of the effect it would have on an audience of rhino when the actor on stage suddenly begin turn_into a rhinoceros . 
the rhino would panic , scream ' help ' ! 
- if that can be scream in their language '' . 
`` you think the russian are get_ahead of us in comedy '' ? 
person demand . 
`` non-god , no '' , i say . 
`` the political and intellectual left begin fight humor and comedy year ago , because they fear thing they do not understand and cannot manage , such_as satire and irony , such_as humor and comedy . 
nevertheless , like any other human_being upon whom the spotlight of the world play continually , person , the anti personality cultist , has become a comic actor , or think he has . 
in his famous meeting with person a_couple_of year ago he seem to believe that he be as funny as person . 
but , like caesar , he have only one joke , so_far_as i can find_out . 
it consist_in say , ' that would be send the goat to look_after the cabbage ' . 
why in the name_of_his_non-god does n't he vary it a_bit '' ? 
`` such_as '' ? 
person ask . 
`` such_as ' send the cat to guard the mouse ' , or ' the falcon to protect the dove ' , or most terribly sharp of all , ' the human_being to save humanity '' ' . 
`` you and i have fall out of literature into politics '' , person observe . 
`` what a nasty fall was there '' ! 
i say . 
person go over to stare at his peacock again , and_then come_back and sit_down , restively . 
`` the world that be once footloose and fancy-free '' , he say , `` has now become screw-loose and frenzy free . 
in our age of science and angst it seem to me more brave to stay on earth and explore inner man than to fly far from the sphere of our sorrow and explore outer_space '' . 
`` the human ego be what it be '' , i put_in , `` science_fiction has always assume that the creature on the planet of a_thousand larger solar_system than ours must look_like gigantic tube-nosed_fruit_bat . 
it seem to me that the first human_being to reach one of these planet may well learn what it is to be a truly great and noble species '' . 
`` now we are leave humor and comedy behind again '' , person protest . 
`` not in the largest sense of the word '' , i say . 
`` the other day person speak against the inveterate tendency of our species to believe_in the uniqueness of its religion , its ideology , and its virtually everything else . 
why do we not realize that no ideology believe so much in itself as it disbelieve in something else ? 
forty year ago an english writer , person , deal with this subject in eddies_of_the_day , and say , as an example , that ' person for location ' would not start a spirit half so quickly as ' strike frog eat frenchman dead '' ' ! 
`` there be also gott_strafe_angleterre '' , person remind me , `` and carthago_delenda_est , or if you will , deus_strafe_carthage . 
it is n't what the ideologist believe_in , but what he hate , that put the world in jeopardy . 
this be the force , in our time and in every other time , that urge the paranoiac and the manic-depressive to become head of a state . 
complete power not_only corrupt but it also attract the mad . 
there be a bitter satire for a future writer in that '' . 
`` great satire has always been clearly write and readily understandable '' , i say . 
`` but we now find writer obsessed by the nooks_and_crannies of their ivory_tower , and curiously devoted to the growing obscurity and complexity of poetry and non poetry . 
i write a_few year ago that one of the cardinal rule of writing be that the reader should be able to get some idea of what the story be about . 
one day , the child had want to get_up onto person 's horse . 
they want to see what his back feel like - the person 's . 
he look so comfortable be straight . 
they want to touch the mystery . 
person was boost_up them up when the policeman come_by . 
he be very rude . 
person have a hard voice , too , this time . 
the policeman 's eye rather pop for a second ; but then person get another tone in a hurry , and she say , `` if it was n't for these dear child '' - . 
the policeman get a confused , funny look on his face , and he had answer kind_of politely , `` now , look_here , lady : i know you got to entertain these kid and all . 
but this be a public park and it 's a city ordinance that the statue cannot be crawl on '' . 
person be so ashamed that she hang her head when she say , `` yes , sir '' . 
the policeman walk on , but he look_back once . 
that had happen on the day when two other unusual thing had occur . 
person had teach them a new way to have fun in their little private area ; and they had tell their mother about the tumble . 
in matter of exact information , that keep her one step behind development ; and so they be consistently true to their principle . 
`` never_mind_'' , person had say , after the policeman had leave , having pursue the usual uncooperative course of grownup . 
`` never_mind . 
i know something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn '' . 
`` what be it '' ? ask the child , whose reflex and reply be invariably so admirably normal and predictable . 
maybe that be why they be cordial and loyal towards the unpredictability of person . 
`` just you wait '' , advise person , echo the dialogue in a recent british movie . 
and when they had get to their little lawn , they had have a most twirlingly magnificent time . 
first , person had put them through some rapid somersault . 
they had protest that that be n't any surprise . 
`` just you wait '' , say person again , as though she were discover the pleasantly tingling insinuation of that handy little sturdy statement . 
`` this be a warm-up '' . 
`` is it anything like cooked-over oatmeal '' ? ask one of the child . 
`` not the_least_bit '' , person snap . 
one of the many thing that be so nice about her be that she always take your question seriously , particularly your very , very serious question . 
those be especially the ones that all other grownup laugh_at loud . 
she would sometimes even get a_little hard on you , she take you so seriously . 
but not hard for very long . 
just long enough to make you feel important . 
`` now '' , say person , eventually , make them both sit in formation on a big root of a live_oak , the sort of root that divide itself and make their bottom sag_down and feel comfortable . 
`` now , we 're going_to be like what person and his horse make us think_of '' . 
the child look at each other and sag their bottom down even more comfortably than ever . 
their curiosity go happily out-of-bounds . 
then , person throw herself backwards and wiggle in a way that be just wonderful . 
she hold herself that way and turn her head towards them and laugh and wink . 
`` imagine be able to laugh and wink when you 're like the top part of that picture_frame at home '' , one of them say . 
they both laugh and wink back . 
`` i'm person 's horse , upside_down '' , person say , sort_of gaspingly , for her : even she had to breathe kind_of funny when she be in that position . 
she make person 's horse 's belly do so funny when it be upside_down . 
then , she be back on her foot , wink and smile that enormous smile ( she have lots of wonderful big tooth that you never would have suspect she have when she was not smile ) . 
and she would wink and throw kiss . 
they both try to keep smile and wink for a long_time , but it make their lip and eyelid tremble . 
but they keep_on clap for a long , long time . 
`` this time '' , person say , and she even keep_on wiggle a_bit little bit while she was just talk , `` you 're going_to tell me what i be and what i'm do . 
it all have something to do with person and his horse '' . 
this time , it be so grand ; they could tell exactly what it be . 
it be person 's horse run in a circle . 
his leg shake , and the shaking go right on up his body through his hip to his shoulder . 
`` that be the general 's horse '' , one of them cry_out . 
the other remark , in a happy laughter , `` that be a funny old horse '' . 
the first one say , `` he sure does shake . 
he be old '' . 
then there be the general kiss his wife . 
they had to be tell that one . 
but it be even funny after they had been tell . 
their father , when he come_back from those many business trip , just bump their mother on the forehead with his lip and ask if anybody had think to mix the martini and put them in the electric icebox . 
but not person . 
he be the funny man . 
he never could keep still , even when he did n't move his foot . 
then , they had to get_up and be person . 
or his horse . 
all they could think_of was to run_around in circle , kick their leg out . 
it be n't very funny . 
then , they say person was going_to jump over his horse 's head ; and they do some somersault . 
but that be n't very funny , either . 
`` you ought to shake '' , person advise them . 
and person show them how to begin . 
she also teach them to sing `` i wish i could shimmy like my sister person '' . 
that help a_lot . 
they be clumsy , but they were begin to catch_on . 
they also catch_on a_bit little bit on how to smile a_lot without your lip tremble . 
`` imagine you won't get your allowance if you 're catch not smile - or smile with your lip tremble too_much '' , person suggest . 
that help a_great_deal . 
they be a_little late in get home . 
`` i'm sorry , person '' , person say in a tone so low you could hardly hear it . 
my mother constitute herself the voice of all_of us . 
`` it be perfectly understandable , person '' , my mother say in a friendly way . 
`` i suppose you all were play and forget '' ? 
`` yes , ma'am '' , the child chorus heartily . 
we could n't help laugh . 
the child rush_off to get_rid_of their sweater ; and person begin tap the kitchen door open . 
`` person be a good girl '' , my uncle remark to us ; but he say it too_soon , for it come_out just before the tap to which the door respond . 
that tap have a slight bang ish quality . 
`` she really be a dear little thing '' , my mother agree . 
her upper lip lift slightly . 
she was bite into a small red radish ; and that action always cause her to lift her lip from the sting of the thing . 
also , she live in continual fear of find a white worm curled_up in a neat , mean little heap at the white center of the radish . 
she would try to see over the bulge of her cheek and somewhat under her tooth to the place where she was bite . 
it never work , naturally ; but it make her look unusual . 
also , when she had bite_off half of the small radish , she find the suspense unbearable ; and she would snatch the finger hold_out half of the radish out to where she could inspect it . 
one could hear a very faint , ladylike sigh of relief . 
actually , it be inaudible to anyone not expect it . 
but the warm joy of her brown eye be open to the general public . 
later_on , the child tell her further about somersaulting . 
`` it must be awfully good for them . 
and awfully kind of person '' , she tell us later . 
`` but do you know something curious '' ? she add . 
`` i reach_into that funny little pocket that is high_up on my dress . 
i have no notion why i reach . 
and i find a radish . 
was it an omen ? 
i think for a second . 
but i would not pamper myself in that silly way . 
i open the window and throw_out the radish out '' . 
then , my mother blush at this small lie ; for she know and we know that it be cowardice that had make one more radish that night just too impossible a strain . 
person become indispensable ; nobody could have tell why . 
but she be . 
it be in_the_air . 
a friend of my father 's come to dinner . 
he was pass_through town and phone to say hello . 
as a result , he was persuade out to dinner . 
as_a_matter_of_fact , this happen every four or five month . 
sometimes , he coincide with my father 's be at home . 
sometimes , as at this juncture , he did not . 
but he was always persuade out . 
he like child , in a loathsome kind of way ; the two young in our family always had to be bring_in and put_through trick for his entertainment . 
when he had leave , i could never remember whether he had poke them in their middle , laughingly , with a thick index_finger or whether he be merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assume the action , not bother to look . 
the child loathe him , too . 
this_evening , they were push in from the breakfast room , with odds_and_ends of dessert distribute over them . 
there had be some coconut in it , for i remember my mother 's taking a quick glance at a stringy bit of this nut on the cheek of one of them and_then put_down her radish with a shiver . 
they were push gently into the room by person - whose only part appear be hand that creep quickly back around to the kitchen side of the door . 
we had just sit_down . 
`` tell person what you 're do these day '' , my mother advise the child , ceremonially . 
there was an air of revolt about the child - even irreverence for their own principle . 
this could be tell chiefly from a sort of head toss and prance , a horse like balkiness of demeanor . 
possibly , the coconut contain dessert had bring_up bitter problem of administration . 
but , at the beginning , this stay just in_the_air . 
`` we go_to the park with this nice lady '' , one of them say . 
`` we have good time '' . 
this happy bulletin convulse person . 
`` you do '' ? he ask , between wheeze of laughter . 
he was force to wipe his eye . 
`` you do n't step on the flower , do you ? 
eh '' ? 
one of the child maneuver out of range of the poke index_finger . 
`` no '' , he say . 
`` we do n't '' . 
person take a swig of his sherry . 
he was so long think that my mother have time to inspect her sherry for dregs . 
usually , this was do when attention was divert by someone else 's long , boring story . 
but this time she be nervous : she be open . 
person be finally in command of his mind again . 
`` tell me - what do you do at the park '' ? he ask . 
this was deliver in a forthright way , without coyness and over pretended interest - an admirable way with child . 
only , unfortunately , he could not remove from his voice a nagging insinuation of the direct command . 
this nettle the child into the revelation of exact truth , a sacrifice of their secret superiority over grown people , but a victory in the wide field of perpetration and illegitimate accomplishment . 
`` we bump '' , one say ; and the other go_on to development of the idea . 
`` we grind , too '' , he say . 
my mother be beside_herself with curiosity . 
`` say that again '' , she plead . 
she laugh a_little and toss the dregs rakishly around in her glass . 
`` you what '' ? 
she could see that person was intrigue ; the hostess in her take_over . 
she be rollickingly happy . 
`` you what '' ? 
my uncle look at person . 
he read person and used_to pretend profundity through eye-beaming at people . 
person look down . 
he would not look up . 
he be very funny about the whole_thing . 
person , a delightful vignette set in the unforgettable epoch of pre punic_war rome . 
person , the hero , is beset from all side by the problem of approach manhood . 
the story open on the eve of his fifty-third birthday , as he prepare_for the two_weeks of festivity that be to follow . 
suddenly , a messenger arrive and , just before collapse dead at his foot , inform him that the saracen have invade location , the home province of his affianced . 
he at_once cancel the celebration and , buckle on his scimitar , stumble blindly from the house , where he is hit and kill by a passing oxcart . 
the group 's presentation of person 's immortal il_sevigli_del_spegititgninino , with guest contralto person . 
an unusual , if not extraordinary , rendering of the classic myth that involve the rescue of prometheus from the rock by the group was give last week in the warehouse of the group amid cheer of `` hubba hubba '' and `` yalagaloo pip pip '' ! 
after a `` busy '' overture , the curtain rise on a farm scene - the location in northern maine . 
a dead armadillo , the sole occupant of the stage , symbolize the crisis and destruction of the old_order . 
old_order , act and atonally sing by person , the lovely serbantian import , then enter and deliver the well-known invocation to the god person , whereupon the stage is quite unexpectedly visit by a company of wandering location priest , symbolize love , lust , prudence and group , respectively . 
according to the myth , old_order then vanish at stage_left and reappear at extreme stage_right , but director person skillfully sidestep the rather gooshey problem of stage_effect by simply having person walk across the stage . 
the night we see it , a rather unpleasant situation arise when the soloist refuse to approach the armadillo , complain - in ad_lib - that `` it smell '' . 
we catch the early train to new_york . 
the dharma_dictionary , a list of highly unusual term use in connection with eurasian proto-senility cult . 
it 's somewhat off_the_beaten_track , to_be_sure , but therein lie its variety and charm . 
for_example , probably very few people know that the word `` visrhanik '' that is banter about so much today stem from the verb `` bouanahsha '' : to salivate . 
likewise , and equally fascinating , be the news that such unlikely synonym as `` pratakku '' , `` sweathruna '' , and the tongue_twister `` nnuolapertar-it-vuh-karti-biri-pitknoumen '' all originate_in the same village in location and are all use to express sentiment concern british `` imperialism '' . 
the term be fairly safe to use on this side of the ocean , but before you start spout them to your date , it might be best to find_out if he be a member of person 's group , since resentment toward the native be reportedly very high in_that outfit . 
the_breeze_and_chancellor_neitzbohr , a movie melodrama that concern the attempt of a west german politician to woo a plaster_cast of the person . 
as you have doubtless guess already , the plot is plaster with freudian , jungian , and meinckian theory . 
for_example , when the film be only four minute old , person refer to a small , victorian piano_stool as `` person '' , and we are thereupon subject to a flashback that inform us that this very piano_stool was once use by an epileptic governess whose name , of_course , be person ( the english equivalent , when pass_through middle gaelic derivation , of person ) . 
for the remainder of the movie , person proceed to lash the piano_stool with a slat from a venetian_blind that used to hang in the prewar location . 
in this manner , he seek to expunge from his own soul the guilt_pang cause by his personal assault against the_english at location . 
as we find_out at the end , it is not the stool ( symbolize person , therefore the_english ) that he is punish but the piece of venetian_blind . 
and , when the slat finally shatter , we see him count the fragment , all the while mutter , `` he love me , he love me not '' . 
after a_few tortuous moment of wonder who `` he '' be , the movie_camera pan across the room to the plaster statue , and we realize that person is try to redeem himself in_the_eyes_of a mute piece of sculpture . 
the effect , needless to say , be almost terrifying , and though at_times a_bit obscure , the film be certainly a much needed catharsis for the `` repressed '' moviegoer . 
the music of bini_salfininistas , capital_lp 63711 - r , one of the rare recording of this titanic , yet unsung , composer . 
those person who be lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the brest-silevniov_festival in august , 1916 , will certainly welcome his return to public notice ; and it be not unlikely that , even as the great person lie_dormant for so many year , so has the erudite , ingenious person pass_through his `` purgatory '' of neglect . 
but now , under the guidance of the contemporary composer person person , a major revival be underway . 
as he lead the group , person give a tremendously inspired performance of both the person and person concerto , include the controversial person cadenza , which was include at the conductor 's insistence . 
a major portion of the credit should also go to flautist person for his render of the almost impossible `` indianapolis '' movement in the person . 
not_only be person 's intonation and phrasing without flaw , but he seem to take every tonal eccentricity in_stride . 
for_example , to move ( as the score require ) from the low f major register up_to a barely audible n minor in four second , not skip , at_the_same_time , even one of the 407 fingering , seem a feat too absurd to consider , and it be to the flautist 's credit that he remain silent throughout the passage . 
we would have prefer , however , to have had the rest of the orchestra refrain_from laugh at this and other spot on the recording , since it mar an otherwise sober , if not lofty , performance . 
as broadway itself become increasingly weight_down by trite , heavy-handed , commercially successful musical and inspirational problem drama , the american theatre is go_through an inexorable renaissance in_that nebulous area known_as `` off-broadway '' . 
for the last two year , this frontier of the arts has produce a number of so-called `` non drama '' which have leave indelible , bittersweet impression on the psyche of_this veteran theatregoer . 
the latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of_this theatrical vine be the , an adaptation of person 's classic frog haiku by person , a former group chemistry instructor . 
although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there be eleven act vary in length from twenty-five second to an hour and a half ) , the statement it make concern the ceaseless yearning and search of youth be profound and worthy of our attention . 
the action center about a group of outspoken and offbeat student sit around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee . 
they are relentlessly rebuff on all side by a waitress , the police , and an intrude government tutor . 
the innocence that they try to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroy forever when one of them , ask for a piece of lemon_meringue_pie , get a plate of english_muffin instead . 
leave the theatre after the performance , i have a flash of intuition that life , after_all ( as person say ) , be just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee , and that this unpretentious , moving , clever , bitter slice of life be the greatest thing to happen to the american theatre since person retire . 
age but still precocious , french feline enfant_terrible person has succeed in shock jaded old paris again , this time with a sexy ballet scenario called the_lascivious_interlude , the story of a nymphomaniac triphammer operator who fall_in_love hopelessly in_love with a middle-aged steam_shovel . 
a biting , pithy parable of the all pervading hollowness of modern life , the piece has been set by person to a sumptuous score ( a single motif play over_and_over by four thousand french_horn ) by existentialist hotshot person . 
petite , lovely person play the nymphomaniac engagingly . 
ever since bambi , and , more recently , born_free , there have be a_lot of book about animal , but few compare with person 's wry , understate , charming , and immensely readable my_friend_, the quizzical_salamander . 
do in the modern style of a `` confession '' , person tell in exquisite detail how he came to know , and , more important , love his mother 's pet salamander , person . 
it be not an entirely happy book , as person soon become jealous of person and , in retaliation , refuse to continue to scrape the algae off her glass . 
person , in a fit of despair , take person and run_off for two marvelous week in location ( person call it `` the most wonderful and lovely fourteen day in my whole life '' ) , at the end of which person tragically contract parkinson's_disease and die . 
this brief resume hardly do_justice the book justice , but i heartily recommend it to all those who be engage with the major problem of our time . 
opera in the grand_tradition , along with mah-jongg , seem to be stage a well deserved comeback . 
in this country , the two guiding_light be , without_doubt , person and person . 
person , a lean , chiseled , impeccable gentleman of the old_school who was once mistake on the street for person , be responsible_for the rediscovery of person 's earliest , most raucous opera , nabisco , a sumptuous bout-de-souffle with a haunting leitmotiv that strike me as be highly reminiscent_of the person version of `` volare '' . 
person have a voice that person once describe as `` like chip tooth with a screwdriver '' , and her round , opalescent face become fascinatingly reflective of the emotion demand by the role of person . 
the location is literally litter this summer with the prostrate body of france 's beat-up beatnik jeunes_filles . 
cause of all this commotion : squat , pug-nosed , balding , hopelessly ugly person , a bogartian figure , who play a sadistic , amoral , philosophic group salesman in old new_waver person 's endlessly provocative film , a_sour_sponge . 
person has been alternately describe as `` a symbol of the new grandeur of france and myself '' ( person ) and `` a decadent , disgusting slob '' ! 
( person ) , but no one can deny that the screen crackle with electricity whenever he be on it . 
soar to stardom along with him , person , a luscious and curvaceously beguiling italian starlet , turn_in a creditable performance as an airplane mechanic . 
the battle of the drib-drool continue , but most of new_york 's knowing sophisticate of abstract_expressionism are stamp their foot impatiently in expectation of v ( for vindication ) day , september first , when person 's first one-man show open at the location . 
we have hear that after see person 's work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity and importance of the whole abstract movement . 
and it is think by many who think_about such thing that person be the logical culmination of a school that start with person , progress through person and the cubist picasso , and blossom just recently in person and person . 
person define his own art as `` the search for what be not there '' . 
`` i paint the nothing '' , he say once to person and myself , `` the nothing that_is behind the something , the inexpressible , unpaintable ' tick ' in the unconscious , the ' spirit ' of the moment rest forever , suspend like a huge balloon , in non time '' . 
it is his relentlessness and unwavering adherence to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enable him to paint such picture as `` the_invasion_of_cuba '' . 
in this work , his use of non color be startling and skillful . 
the sweep of space , the delicate counterbalance of the white mass , the overall completeness and unity , the originality and imagination , all entitle it to be call an authentic masterpiece . 
i ask person recently how he accomplish this , and he reply that he had paint his model `` a beautiful shade of red and_then have her breathe on the canvas '' , which be his typical tongue-in-cheek way of chide me for my lack of sensitivity . 
dear sirs : let me begin by clear_up any possible misconception in your mind , wherever you be . 
the collective by which i address you in the title above be neither patronizing nor jocose but an exact industrial term in_use among professional thief . 
it be , i am reliably give to understand , the technical argot for those who engage in your particular branch of the boost ; i.e. , burglar who rob while the tenant be absent , in contrast to hot slough prowler , those who work while the occupant be home . 
since the latter obviously require an audacity you do not possess , you may perhaps suppose that i am taunt you as socially inferior . 
far from it ; i merely draw an etymological distinction , hope that specialist and busy people like you will welcome such precision in a layman . 
above_all , disabuse yourselves of any thought that i propose to vent moral indignation at your rifle my residence , to whimper over the loss of a_few objet_d'art , or to shame you into rectitude . 
my object , rather , is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the grave implication for you , far beyond the legal sanction society might inflict . 
you have unwittingly set_in_motion force so malign , so vindictive , that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them . 
quite candidly , fellow , i would n't be_in_your_shoes for all the rice in china . 
as you 've doubtless forget the circumstance in the press of more recent depredation , permit me to recapitulate them briefly . 
sometime on saturday evening , august 22nd , while my family and i were dine at the group , in rome , you jimmy a window of our home in location , pennsylvania , and let yourselves into the premises . 
hasten to the attic , the temperature of_which be easily hot than the location , you proceed to mask the window with a fancy wool coverlet , some khaki pants , and the_like , and to ransack the innumerable box and barrel store there . 
what you were look_for ( unless you make a hobby of collect old tennis_racket and fly screen ) elude me , but to judge from phonograph_record scatter about a fumed_oak victrola , you dance two tango and a paso_doble , which must have been fairly enervate in that milieu . 
you then descend one story , glom a television_set from the music room - the only constructive feature of your visit , by_the_way - and , return to the ground_floor , enter the master_bedroom . 
from the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureau beneath , you abstract seventeen ivory , metal , wood , and stone sculpture of oriental and african origin , two snuffbox , and a jade handled magnifying_glass . 
rummage through a stack of drawer nearby , you unearth an antique french chess_set in ivory and sandalwood , which , along with two box_kodak , you add to your haul . 
then , having wrap the lot in an afghan my dog customarily sleep on , you lam out the front_door , considerately leave it open for neighbor to discover . 
so_much_for the tiresome fact , as familiar to you , i'm sure , as to the constable and state trooper who follow in your wake . 
the foregoing , aid by several clue i 'll withhold to keep you on_your_toes , will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of person , but before they close_in , gird yourselves , i repeat , for a vengeance infinitely more pitiless . 
fourteen of the sculpture you take possess property of a most curious and terrifying nature , as you will observe when your limb begin to wither and your hair fall_out in patch . 
in_time , these minor manifestation will multiply and effloresce , riddle you with frambesia , the king's_evil , sheep_rot , and clonic spasm , until your very existence become a burden and you cry_out_for release . 
all this , though , be simply a prelude , a curtain_raiser , for what ensue , and i doubt whether any occidental could accurately forecast it . 
if , however , it would help to intensify your anguish , i can delimit the power of a_few of the divinity you 've affront and describe the punishment they meted_out in one analogous instance . 
hold_on tight . 
first_of_all , the six figure of the buddha you heist - four siamese head , a black obsidian statuette in the earth touch position , and a large brass figure of the dying_buddha on a teakwood base . 
now , you probably share the widespread western belief that the person be the most compassionate of the god , much more so than person and person and the rest . 
' fess up - do n't you ? 
well , ordinarily he be , except ( as the wheel_of_the_law specify ) toward impious folk who steal , disturb , or maltreat the presence . 
very peculiar retribution indeed seem to overtake such joker . 
eight or ten year ago , a_couple_of french hood steal a priceless khmer head from the group , in paris , and a week later crawl into the group with unmistakable symptom of leprosy . 
hell 's own amount of chaulmoogra_oil do nothing to alleviate their torment ; they expire amid indescribable fantods , implore the person to forgive their desecration . 
any reputable french interne can supply you with a dozen similar instance , and i 'll presently recount a case out of my own personal experience , but , for_the_moment , let 's resume our catalogue . 
whether the pair of sudanese ivory carving you lift really possess the juju to turn your liver to lead , as a dealer in khartoum assure me , i be not competent to say . 
likewise the ivory chinese female figure known as a `` doctor lady '' ( provenance location ) ; a friend of mine remove her from the curio cabinet for inspection was fell as if by a hammer , but he had previously drink a quantity of applejack . 
the three indian brass deity , though - person , person , and person - be an altogether different cup_of_tea . 
they hail from location , a state in the subcontinent where person , the goddess of death , is worship . 
have you ever hear of thuggee ? 
nuf sed . 
but it be the wooden sculpture from bali , the one represent two man with their head bend backward and their body interlace by a fish , that i particularly call to your attention . 
oddly_enough , this be an amulet against housebreaker , present to the mem and me by a local rajah in 1949 . 
inscribe around its base be a charm in balinese , a dialect i take it you do n't comprehend . 
neither do i , but the person be good enough to translate , and i 'll do as much for you . 
whosoever violate our rooftree , the legend state , can expect maximal sorrow . 
the tooth will rain from his mouth like pebble , his wife will make him cocu with fishmonger , and a trolley_car will grow in his stomach . 
furthermore - and this , to me , strike an especially warming note - it shall avail the vandal naught to throw_away or dispose of their loot . 
the cycle of disaster start the moment they touch any belongings of ours , and dog them unto the forty-fifth generation . 
sort_of remorseless , is n't it ? 
still , there it be . 
now , you no_doubt regard the preceding as pap ; you 're tool_around full of gage in your hot_rod , gorge yourselves on pizza and play pinball in the tavern and generally behave like ubermensch . 
in that case , listen to what befall another wisenheimer who tangle_with our joss . 
a_couple_of year back , i occupy a location apartment whose outer staircase contain the type of niche called a `` coffin turn '' . 
in it be a stone tibetan buddha i had pick_up in bombay , and occasionally , to make merit , my wife and i garland it with flower or lay a_few penny in its lap . 
after a while , we become aware that the money was disappear as fast as we replenish it . 
our suspicion eventually center_on , by the process of elimination , on a grocer 's boy , a thoroughly bad_hat , who deliver carton to the people overhead . 
the more i probe into this young_man 's activity and character , the less savory i find him . 
i learn , for_example , that he make a practice of yap at dog he encounter and , in winter , of sprinkle salt on the icy pavement to scarify their foot . 
his energy be prodigious ; sometimes he would be up before dawn , clad as a garbage_collector and hurl pail into areaway to exasperate us , and thereafter would hurry to the group to grimace at the lion and press cigar_butt against their paw . 
evening , he was frequently to be see at restaurant like person + person or group drunkenly don lady ' hat and sing `` o_sole_mio '' . 
in_short , and to borrow an arboreal phrase , slash_timber . 
well , the odious little toad go_along chivy animal and human who could n't retaliate , and in_due_course , as be inevitable , overreach himself . 
one morning , we discover not_only that the penny be miss from the idol but that a cigarette had been stub_out in its lap . 
`` now he 's buy_it '' , say my wife contentedly . 
`` no divinity will hold_still_for that . 
he 's really ask for it '' . 
and how right she be . 
the next time we see him , he be a changed person ; he had age thirty year , and his face , the color of tallow , was crisscrossed with wrinkle , as though it had been wrap in chicken wire . 
some sort_of nemesis was haunt his footstep , he tell us in a quavering voice - either an ape specter or person , a process-server , we could n't determine which . 
his eye have the same dreadful rigid stare as person 's when he was find before his open safe wear the speckled band . 
the grocery the youth work for soon tired_of his depressing effect on customer , most of whom be sufficiently neurotic without the threat of incubus , and let him go . 
the beautiful , the satisfying part of his disintegration , however , be the masterly way the buddha polish_off him off . 
reduced to beggary , he at_last get a job as office_boy to a television producer . 
his hubris , deficiency of taste , and sadism carry him straightaway to the top . 
he evolve program that plumb new depth of bathos and besmirch whole network , and quickly supersede his boss . 
not long_ago , i ride down with him in an elevator in group ; he was talk to himself thirteen to the dozen and smoke two cigar at_once , clearly a man in_extremis . 
`` see that guy '' ? the operator ask pityingly . 
`` i would n't be_in_his_shoes for all the rice in china . 
there 's some kind_of a nemesis haunt his footstep '' . 
however one look_at it , therefore , i 'd say that your horoscope for this autumn be the reverse of rosy . 
the inventory you acquire from me is n't going_to be easy to move ; you can't very well sidle up to people on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot person . 
additionally , since you 're going_to be hors_de_combat pretty soon with sprue , yaws , delhi_boil , the granville_wilt , liver_fluke , bilharziasis , and a host of other complication of the hex you 've arouse , you must n't expect to be lionize socially . 
my advice , if you live long enough to continue your vocation , be that the next time you 're attract by the exotic , pass_up it up - it 's nothing but a headache . 
as you can count_on me to do the same . 
compassionately yours , 
person . 
the door of the d train slide shut , and as i drop into a seat and , exhale , look up across the aisle , the whole aviary in my head burst into song . 
she be a living doll and no mistake - the blue-black bang , the wide cheekbone , olive flushed , that betray the cherokee strain in her midwestern lineage , and the mouth whose only fault , in the novelist 's carping phrase , be that the lower lip be a_trifle too voluptuous . 
from what i be able to gauge in a swift , greedy glance , the figure inside the coral colored boucle dress be stupefying . 
your invitation to write_about person to honor his 70th anniversary for the april issue of sovietskaya_muzyka is accept with pleasure , because i admire the music of person ; and with sober purpose , because the development of person personify , in many way , the course of music in the union_of_soviet_socialist_republics . 
the person whom we know in the united_states_of_america be gay , witty , mercurial , full of prank and bonheur - and very capable as a professional musician . 
these quality endear him to both the musician and the social economic haute monde which support the concert world of the post world_war_i , era . 
person 's outlook as a composer pianist conductor in america be , indeed , brilliant . 
person 's classical_symphony was hail as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well trained musician still in his twenties . 
to the traditionalist , it be a brilliant satire on modernism ; to the neo classicist , it be a challenge to the prewar world . 
what be it to person ? 
a tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th century idea ; a trial_balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times ; a brilliant piece_de_resistance ? 
certainly its composer be an ascending star on a new world horizon . 
i hear the classical_symphony for_the_first_time when person conduct it in paris in 1927 . 
all musical paris be there . 
some musician be enthusiastic , some skeptical . 
i myself be one of the skeptic ( 35 year ago ) . 
i remember person in the foyer , shout in his high-pitched voice : `` it may be a tour_de_force , mais_mon_dieu , can anyone take this music seriously '' ? 
the answer be , `` yes '' ! 
certainly , america take person and his classical_symphony seriously , and with a good_deal of pleasure . 
his lifelong friend , person , give unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performance in boston , new_york , and washington , dc , to_which he add broadcasting and recording for the whole nation . 
chicago be also a welcome host : there , in 1921 , person conduct the world_premiere of the love_for_three_oranges , and play the first performance of his third_piano_concerto . 
`` uncle_sam '' be , indeed , a rich uncle to person , in those opulent , postwar victory year of peace and prosperity , bold speculation and extravaganza , enjoyment and pleasure : `` the golden_twenties '' . 
we attend the premiere of his concerto , symphony , and suite ; we study , teach , and perform his piano_sonata , chamber_music , gavotte , and march ; we buy his record and play them in our school and university . 
we unanimously agree that person had win his right as a world citizen to the first rank of twentieth century composer . 
nevertheless , person was much influence by paris during the twenties : the paris which be the artistic center of the western world - the social paris to which russian aristocracy migrate - the chic paris which attract the tourist dollar of rich america - the avant-garde paris of person , stravinsky , person , person , picasso - the laissez-faire paris of dadaism and ultramodern art - the paris sympathique which take young composer to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasm . 
so young person be the darling of success : 
in his motherland ; in the spacious hunting_ground of `` uncle_sam '' ; in the exciting salon of his lovely , brilliant paris - mistress of gaiety - excess and abandon - world theatre of new found freedom in tone , color , dance , design , and thought . 
meanwhile , three great terrible force were coagulate and crystallize . 
in this worldwide conscription of men , mind , and machine , person was recall to his native_land . 
the world explode when fascism challenge all concept of peace and liberty , and the outraged , freedom love people of the capitalist and socialist world combine force to stamp fascist tyranny into cringing submission . 
after this holocaust , a changing world occupy the mind of man ; a world beset with new boundary , new treaty and government , new goal and method , and the age-old fear of aggression and subjugation - hunger and exposure . 
in this changed world , person settle to find himself , and to create for large national purpose . 
here , this happy , rove son of good_fortune prove that he could accept the discipline of a new social economic order fight for its very existence and ideal in a truculent world . 
here , person become a workman in the vineyard of socialism - produce music for the masses . 
it is at this point in his life that the mature person emerge . 
one might have expect that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroy the creative flair of a composer , especially one whose work be so fluent and spontaneous . 
but no : person grow . 
he accept the environment of his destiny - take_root and grow to fulfill the stature of his early promise . 
by 1937 he had clarify his intention to serve his people : `` i have strive for clarity and melodious idiom , but at_the_same_time i have by_no_means attempt to restrict myself to the accepted method of harmony and melody . 
this be precisely what make lucid , straightforward music so difficult to compose - the clarity must be new , not old '' . 
how right he be ; how clearly he see the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism . 
and with what resource did person back_up his credo of words - with torrent of powerful music . 
compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between his neat and witty little classical_symphony and his big , muscular , passionate , and eloquent fifth_symphony ; or the love_for_three_oranges ( gay as it be ) with the wonderful , imaginative , colorful , and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet , the stone_flower . 
this masterpiece have gaiety , too , but it be the gaiety of dancing people : earthy , salty and humorous . 
of_course , these work be not comparable , even though the same brain conceive them . 
the early work were conceive for a sophisticated , international audience ; the late work were conceive to affirm a way_of_life for fellow citizen . 
however , in all of person 's music , young or mature , we find his profile - his `` signature '' - his craftsman 's attitude . 
person never forsake his medium for the cause of experimentation per_se . 
in orchestration , he stretch the limit of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color . 
his sense for rhythmic variety and timing be impeccable . 
his creative development of melodic design of slavic dance tune and love song be captivating : witty , clever , adroit , and subtle . 
his counterpoint be pertinent , skillful , and rarely thick . 
also , it should be note that the polytonal freedom of his melody and harmonic modulation , the brilliant orchestration , the adroitness for evade the heaviness of figured_bass , the skill in florid counterpoint be not lost in his mature output , even in the spectacular historical drama of the stage and cinema , where a large , dramatic canvas of sound be required . 
that person 's harmony and form sometimes seem professionally routine to our ear , may or may not indicate that he be less of an `` original '' than we prefer to believe . 
need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability . 
person might well emerge as a cultural hero , who , by the force of his creative life , help preserve the main stream of tradition , to which the surviving idiom of current experimentalism may be eventually add and integrate . 
at this date , it seem probable that the name of person will appear in the archives of history , as an effective traditionalist , who be fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation , and use it as it serve his purpose ; yet be never caught_up in it - never a slave to its academic dialectic . 
certainly , it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endear him to the western world - not his experimentation . 
so person be able to cultivate his musical talent and harvest a rich reward from them . 
nor can anyone be certain that person would have do better , or even as well , under different circumstance . 
his fellow countryman , person stravinsky , certainly do not . 
why did person expand in stature and fecundity , while stravinsky ( who leap into fame like a young giant ) dwindle in stature and fruitfulness ? 
i think the answer is to be find in person 's own words : 
`` the clarity must be new , not old '' . 
when person forge his new clarity of `` lucid , straightforward music , so difficult to compose '' , he shape his talent to his purpose . 
when stravinsky shape his purpose to the shifting scene of many culture , many salon , many dialectic , many personality , he try to refashion himself into a stylist of many style , determine by many disparate culture . 
person was guide in a consistent direction by the life of his own people - by the compass of their national idea . 
but person was sway by the attitude of whatever culture he was reflect . 
in all his miscalculation , person make the fatal historical blunder of presume that he could transform other composer ' inspiration - represent many people , time_period and style - into his own music by warp the harmony , melody , or form , to verify his own experiment . 
because of the authentic homogeneity of his early nationalistic material , and his flair for orchestration - his brilliant petruchka , his savage sacre_du_printemps , his incisive les_noces - the world keep hope that he could recapture the historical direction for which his native talent be predisposed . 
but time is run_out , and many_of stravinsky 's admirer begin to fear that he will never find terra_firma . 
his various aesthetic postulate remain as landmark of a_house_divided_against_itself : supra_expressionism , neo paganism , neoclassicism , neoromanticism , neo_jazz , neo ecclesiasticism , neo popularism , and most_recently , post serialism - all compete with each other within one composer ! 
what a patchwork of proclamation and renunciation ! 
meager and shabby by-product linger to haunt our memory of a once mighty protagonist ; a maladroit reharmonization of our national_anthem ( the star-spangled_banner ) ; a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto ; a circus polka for elephant ; his hope that the tune from his old music might be use for popular american commercial song ! 
stravinsky , near the age of eighty , be like a lost and frantic bird , flit from one abandoned nest to another , search for a home . 
how differently person 's life unfold . 
person be able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without lose his particular force and direction . 
in the process , his native endowment were stretch , strengthen and discipline to serve their human purpose . 
with a large and circumspect 20th century technique , he weave the material of national hero and event , national folklore and child 's fairytale - slavic dance and love song - into a solid musical literature which serve his people well , and is provide much enjoyment to the world at_large . 
of_course , it must_not be forget that in achieve this historical feat , person have the vast resource of his people behind him ; time and economic security ; symphony_orchestra , opera and ballet_company ; chorus , chamber_music ensemble ; soloist ; recording ; broadcasting ; television ; large and eager audience . 
it must be concede that his native_land provide person with many_of the necessary condition for great creative incentive : 
economic security and cultural opportunity , incisive idiom , social fermentation for a new national ideology - a sympathetic public and a large body of performer especially train to fulfill his purpose . 
thus in person the union_of_soviet_socialist_republics produce one of the great composer of the twentieth century . 
that his mood , even in his early year , be those of his people , do him honor , as his music honor those who inspire it . 
that he master every aspect of his medium according_to his own great talent and contemporary judgment , be a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressure of proclaim and practise the rigor of a new culture ; and perhaps of even greater significance - his music be strong 20th century evidence of the effectiveness of evolution , based on a broad traditionalism for the creative art of music . 
april tenth mark a memorable date in new_york 's musical history - indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern united_states . 
on that date the group , organize to furnish employment for musician unable to obtain engagement during the great_depression and to provide relief for older musician who lose their fortune in the stock_market crash , observe its 30th anniversary . 
person be essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction have a kinship with the english watercolorist of the early nineteenth century , especially the beautifully pattern art of person . 
and like this english master , person realize his subject in large , simplified mass which , though they seem effortless , be in_reality the result of skilled design bear of hard work and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspire them . 
as a boy person begin the long process of extract the goodness of the out-of-doors , its tang of weather , its change of season , its variable mood . 
his father , a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter , take his son on numerous hunting_expedition , and impart to them his knowledge and love of nature . 
out of this background of hunting and fishing , it be only natural that person first paint subject he know best : hunter in the field , fisherman in the stream , duck and goose on_the_wing - almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape . 
it is this subject_matter that has bring person a large and enthusiastic following among sportsman , but it be his exceptional performance with this motif that commend him to artist and discerning collector . 
person had_to earn the privilege of devote himself exclusively to painting . 
like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family_business which , though it be allied to art of a kind - the design and production of engraved seal - bear no relation to the painting of picture . 
but it did teach person the basic technique of commercial_art , and later , for twelve year , he and his sister person conduct an advertising art studio in location . 
on the death of their father , they return to their home in location , new_york . 
after more year of concentrated effort , person and his brother person finally establish a thriving family_business at the old stand . 
during all this time person continue to paint , first only on weekend , and_then , as the family_business permit , for longer period . 
gradually he withdraw from the shop altogether , and for the past thirty year , he has work independently as a painter , except for his continued hunting and fishing expedition . 
but even on these , the palette often take_over while the shotgun cool_off ! 
except for a rich friendship with the painter , person who give him the only professional instruction he ever have - and this was limit to a_few lesson , though the two artist often go on painting trip together - person develop his art by himself . 
in the best tradition , he first teach himself to see , then to draw with accuracy and assurance , and_then to paint . 
he work in oil for year before begin his work in watercolor , and his first public recognition and early honor , include his election to the academy , be for his essay in the heavy medium . 
gradually watercolor claim his greater affection until today it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique . 
it has be my privilege to paint with person on numerous occasion , mostly in the vicinity of location . 
more_often_than_not i have find easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where i could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed , not imitative , painting . 
what i have observe time_and_time_again be a process of integration , integration that begin as abstract design and gradually take_on recognizable form ; color pattern that are make to weave throughout the whole composition ; and that overall , amazing control of large wash which be the person stylemark . 
finally come those little flick of a rigger brush and the job be done . 
inspiring - yes ; instructive - maybe ; duplicable - no ! 
but for the technical fact , we have the artist 's own testimony : 
`` of_late year , i find that i like well to work out_of_doors . 
first i make preliminary watercolor sketch in quarter scale ( approximately * * f inch ) in which i pay particular attention to the design principle of three simple value - the light light , the middle tone , and the dark dark - by reduce the form of my subject to these large pattern . 
if a human figure or wildlife are to be part of the projected final picture , i try to place them in the initial sketch . 
for me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceive in this early stage , though i freely admit that i do not hesitate to add or eliminate figure on the full sheet when it serve my final purpose . 
`` i be thoroughly convinced that most watercolor suffer because the artist expect nature will do his composing for him ; as a result , such picture be only a literal translation of what the artist find in the scene before him . 
just because a tree or other object appear in a certain spot be absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting , unless the position serve the design of the whole composition . 
if the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain unit in his design , often only slightly , fine picture would result . 
out of long experience i have find that incidental figure and other object like tree , log , and bush can be trace from the original sketch and move about in the major area on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which i call ' click ' . 
`` speed in paint a picture be valid only when it impart spontaneity and crispness , but unless the artist have lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution , he would do_well to take these first sketch and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition . 
`` if i have seem to emphasize the structure of the composition , i mean to project equal concern for color . 
often , in work out_of_doors under all condition of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that look favorable in_relation_to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when view indoors in a mat . 
when this occur , i make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor - if i have been work on a full sheet in the field . 
`` when work from one of my sketch i square_up it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal . 
when this linear draft is complete , i dust it down to a faint image . 
from this point , i paint in as direct a manner as possible , by flow on the wash with as pure a color mixture as i can manage . 
however , first i thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the line i have describe . 
then i plan my attack : the part i will finish first , the range of value , the accenting of minor detail - all_in_all , mechanics of produce the finished job with a maximum of crispness . 
the longer i work , the more i be sure that for me , at_least , a workmanlike method be important . 
trial_and_error be better place in the preliminary sketch than in hope for miracle in the final painting . 
`` as for material , i use the best available . 
i work on a watercolor easel in the field , and frequently resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eye from undue strain . 
in my studio i work at a tilt-top_table , but leave the paper unfixed so that i can move it freely to control the wash . 
i have use a variety of heavyweight handmade paper , but prefer an english make , rough surface , in 400 - pound weight . 
after select a sheet and inspect it for flaw ( even the best sometimes have foreign ' nubbin ' on its surface ) , i sponge it thoroughly on both side with clean , cold water . 
then i dry the sheet under mild pressure so that it will lie flat as a board . 
`` in_addition_to the usual tool , i make constant use of cleansing tissue , not_only to wipe my brush , but to mop_up certain area , to soften edge , and to open_up light in dark wash . 
the great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that it be easy to control than a sponge make it an ideal tool for the watercolorist . 
i also use a small electric hand_blower to dry large wash in the studio . 
`` my brush be different from those use by most watercolorist , for i combine the sable and the bristle . 
the red sable be 8 ; two rigger , 6 and 10 ; and a very large , flat wash brush . 
the bristle be a fitch 2 and a one-half inch brush shave to a sharp chisel edge . 
`` my usual palette consist_of top-quality color : 
alizarin_crimson , orange , raw_sienna , raw_umber , burnt_sienna , sepia , cerulean_blue , cobalt_blue , french_ultramarine_blue , windsor_green , hooker's_green 2 , cadmium_yellow pale , yellow_ochre , payne's_gray , charcoal_gray , davy's_gray , and ivory_black '' . 
in analyze the watercolor of person , the first thing that come_to_mind be their essential decorativeness , yet this word have such a varied connotation that it need some elaboration here . 
true , a person watercolor be unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory . 
unlike many decorative pattern that present a static flat convention , this artist 's picture be full of atmosphere and climate . 
long observation has teach person that most landscape can be reduce to three essential plane : a foreground in sharp focus - either a light area with dark accent or a dark one with light ; a middle_distance often contain the major motif ; and a background , usually a silhouette form foil against the sky . 
in follow this general principle , person provide the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth be instantly create . 
when paint , person 's physical eye be half closed , while his mind's_eye be wide-open , and this circumstance account_for in part for the impression he wish to convey . 
he does not insist on tell all he know about any given subject ; rather his picture invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia . 
it is for this reason that person avoid select subject that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment . 
his picture generalize , though they are inspire by a particular locale ; they universalize in_terms_of weather , sky , earth , and people . 
by deal with common landscape in an uncommon way , person has find a particular niche in american landscape art . 
living with his watercolor be a vicarious experience of see nature distill through the eye of a sensitive interpreter , a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the creator of it all . 
the artist be_born in location , new_york , in 1886 , and until two year ago when he and his wife move to california , he live in western new_york , in location . 
when i look_up the actual date of his birth and find it to be march 15th , i realize that person be_born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist : 
the water sign of pisces ( february 18 - march 20 ) . 
and how very often a water plane is feature in his landscape , and how appropriate that he should appear in american_artist again , in his natal month of march ! 
over the year , begin in 1929 , person has been award seventeen major prize include two gold medal ; two ranger_fund_purchase_awards ; the joseph_pennell_memorial_medal ; two american_watercolor_society_prizes ; the blair_purchase_prize for watercolor , location of chicago ; and_others in location , new_york , location , new_haven , location , location , and most_recently , the $ 300 prize for a watercolor at the group , 
he was elect to the group as an associate in the oil class in 1931 ( after receive his first ranger_fund_purchase_prize at the group in 1930 ) , and elevate to academicianship in 1940 . 
other membership include the group , group , group , group , group . 
every taxpayer be well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our reader also realize that a large portion of these expenditure go for military electronics . 
we have note how some electronic technique , develop for the defense effort , have eventually been use in commerce and industry . 
the host of novel application of electronics to medical problem be far more thrilling because of their implication in matter concern our health and vitality . 
when we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect be staggering . 
the author has recently study the field of medical electronics and has been convince that , in this area alone , the application of electronic_equipment have enormous possibility . 
the benefit electronics can bring to biomedicine may be greater by_far than any previous medical discovery . 
we use the term `` biomedicine '' because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research . 
electronics has been apply to medicine for many year in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray_machine , the electrocardiograph , and the diathermy_machine . 
recently many doctor have install ultrasonic vibration machine for deep massage of bruise , contusion , and simple bursitis . 
commonly use electronic_device which are find in practically every hospital be closed_circuit tv and audio_system for internal paging and instruction , along with radiation counter , timer , and similar device . 
in this article we will concentrate_on the advance in the application of electronics in biomedical research laboratory because this be where tomorrow 's commonplace equipment originate . 
from the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic technique perfect in the past few year we have select a_few example which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tool in medical research . 
many cell , bacteria , and other microorganism be transparent to visible_light and must be stain for microscopic investigation . 
this stain often disrupt the normal cell activity or_else color only the outside . 
a completely new insight into living cell and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replace visible_light with ultraviolet_radiation and combine a microscope with a color - television_system to view the result . 
fig 1 be a simplified block_diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system develop at the group of group . 
by combine the talent of a medical_man , person , a biophysicist , person , and an electronics expert , person , this novel technique has been develop which promise to open broad avenue to understand life process . 
three different wavelength of ultraviolet_radiation are select by the variable filter place in_front_of the three mercury xenon light which serve as the ultraviolet source . 
these wavelength are reflect in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror ; the specimen is magnify by the microscope . 
instead of the observer 's eye the image_orthicon in the television_camera do the `` looking '' . 
the microscope and orthicon are both select to operate well into the ultraviolet_spectrum , which mean that all lens must be quartz . 
the video signal is amplify and then switch , in synchronism with the three ultraviolet_light source which are sequence by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of a second only one wavelength , correspond to red , green , or blue , is see . 
( note : 
because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source to another , the light are switch by a commutator like assembly rotate by a synchronous_motor . 
this assembly also supply a 20 - cps switching gate for the electronics circuitry . ) 
this be the same system as was use in the field sequential color_tv system which precede the present simultaneous system . 
three separate amplifier then drive a 21 - inch tricolor tube . 
the result be a color picture of the specimen where the primary color correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelength . 
many_of the cell and microorganism which be transparent to visible_light , absorb or reflect the much short wavelength of the ultraviolet_spectrum . 
different part of these cell sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelength so that it be often possible to see internal portion of cell in a different color . 
where the microscope under visible_light may show only vague shadow or nothing at_all , ultraviolet_illumination and subsequent translation into a color tv picture reveal a wealth of detail . 
at the present time the research team which pioneer this new technique be primarily interested in advance and perfect it . 
the medical title of `` lobar_ventilation_in_man '' by person and person , cover a brief paper which be one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process . 
at the group , the electronics group has develop the `` respiratory_gas_analyzer '' show in fig 3 . 
this unit , affectionately dub `` the_monster '' , can be wheel to any convenient location and provide a wealth of information about the patient 's breathing . 
in the lower center rack an 8 - channel recorder indicate the percentage of carbon_dioxide and nitrogen from the upper and lower lobe of one lung , the total volume of inhalation per breath , the flow of air from both lobe , and the pressure of the two lobe with_respect_to each_other . 
usually the patient breathe into a mouthpiece while walk a treadmill , stand_still , or in some other medically significant position . 
from the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defect with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail . 
the original electrocardiograph primarily indicate irregularity in the heartbeat , but today 's technique allow exact measurement of the flow of blood through the aorta , dimensioning of the heart and its chamber , and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat . 
for many_of these measurement the chest must be open , but the blood_vessel and the heart itself remain undisturbed . 
a group of researcher at the group have give a paper which briefly outline some of these technique . 
one simple method of measure the expansion of the heart be to tie a thin rubber tube , fill with mercury , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretch . 
a balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder be all the electronic instrumentation needed . 
sonar can be use to measure the thickness of the heart by place small crystal transducer at opposite side of the heart or blood_vessel and excite one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy . 
the travel time of sound in tissue be about 1500 meter per second thus it take about 16 | msec. to traverse 25 mm of tissue . 
a sonar or radar type of pulse_generator and time-delay_measuring_system be required for body tissue evaluation . 
in_addition to the heart and aorta , successful measurement of liver and spleen have also been make by this technique . 
the doppler_effect , use ultrasonic signal , can be employ to measure the flow of blood without cut into the blood_vessel . 
a still more sophisticated system has been devise for determine the effective power of the heart itself . 
it use both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carry a thermistor insert into the bloodstream . 
the latter measure the heat carry_away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow . 
it be also possible to utilize a pressure transducer , mounted at the end of a catheter which is insert into the heart 's left_ventricle , to indicate the blood_pressure in the heart itself . 
this pressure measurement may be make at_the_same_time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is make . 
a simplified version of the instrumentation for this procedure is show in fig 2 . 
output of the two system are measure by a pulse_timing_circuit and a resistance bridge , follow by a simple analogue_computer which feed a multichannel_recorder . 
from this doctor can read heart_rate , change in diameter , pressure , and effective heart power . 
several year ago headline were make by a small radio_transmitter capsule which could be swallow by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receiver . 
this original capsule contain a battery and a transistor oscillator and be about 1 cm in diameter . 
battery life limit the use of this `` pill '' to about 8 to 30 hour maximum . 
a refinement of this technique has been describe by person and person and person of the group of the group . 
in this novel arrangement the `` pill '' be much smaller and contain only a resonant circuit in_which the capacitor is form by a pressure sense transducer . 
as show in fig 4 , an external antenna is place over or around the patient and excite 3000 time a second with short 400 - kc burst . 
the energy receive by the `` pill '' cause the resonant circuit to `` ring '' on after the burst and this `` ring '' take_place at the resonant frequency of the `` pill '' . 
these frequency are amplify and detect by the fm receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and , after the `` pill '' has been calibrate , precise internal pressure indication can be obtain . 
one of the advantage of_this method be that the `` pill '' can remain in the patient for several day , permit observation under natural condition . 
application to organ other_than the gastrointestinal tract are plan for future experiment . 
one of the most gratifying application of an important technique of submarine detection be in the exploration of the human_body . 
our reader be familiar with the principle of sonar where sound_wave are send_out in water and the echo then indicate submerged object . 
various method of pulse , scan , and display these sound_wave are use to detect submarine , map ocean_floor , and even communicate under water . 
in medicine the frequency be much high , transducer and the sonar beam themselves be much small , and different scan technique may be use , but the principle involved be the same as in sonar . 
because the body contain so much liquid , transmission of ultrasonic signal proceed fairly well in muscle and blood_vessel . 
bone and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signal . 
base on this phenomenon , a number of investigator have use this method to `` look through '' human organ . 
a good_example of the result obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contain in paper present by person who has explore the human eye . 
he can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional method indicate blindness due_to glaucoma . 
the method use to scan the eye ultrasonically is illustrate in fig 6 . 
the transducer is couple to the body through a water bath , not show . 
for display , person use a portion of an * * f , an airborne radar indicator , and_then photograph the screen to obtain a permanent record . 
a typical `` sonogram '' of a human eye , together with a description of the anatomical part , is show in fig 5 . 
the frequency use for these experiment be 15 mc and the transducer be a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of provide beam diameter small than one millimeter . 
the transducer itself move the beam in a sector scan , just like a radar antenna , while the entire transducer structure is move over a 90 - degree arc in_front_of the eye to `` look_into '' all corner . 
the total picture is only see by the camera which integrate the many sector scan over the entire 90 - degree rotation period . 
person and person at the group have apply the same sonar technique to other area of soft tissue and have obtain extremely good result . 
by submerge the patient in a tub and rotate the transducer while the scan go_on , they have been able to get cross-section view of the neck , as show in fig 7 , as_well_as many other hitherto impossible insight . 
as mention before , bone reflect the sound energy and in fig 7 the portion of the spine show as the black area in the center . 
artery and vein be apparent by their black , blood-filled center and the surrounding white wall . 
a cross_section of a normal lower human leg is show in fig 8 with the various part label . 
person 's boyhood represent a minimal chance of either attain greatness or serve his people so well and over so long a span of life . 
he was bear in the small danish town of location on the island of location in the south-central part of denmark on august fourteenth , 1777 . 
his father person be the village apothecary whose slender income make it difficult to feed his family , let_alone educate them in a town without even a school . 
the two older boy , person and person , his junior by a year , therefore go daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in german ; his wife teach the two boy to read and write danish . 
other brother later join them for instruction with person , the wigmaker , and also arithmetic was add to bible reading , german , and danish in the informal curriculum . 
person 's contribution were soon exhaust and the boy had to turn_to a wide circle of the town 's learned , such_as the pastor , to supplement the simple teaching . 
from the town surveyor , person learn drawing and mathematics and , from a university_student , some academic subject . 
the mayor of the town teach them english and french . 
whatever person or person learn separately they pass_on to each other ; they read every book that they could borrow in the village . 
at 12 , person be sufficiently mature to help his father in the apothecary shop , which help stimulate his interest in medicine and science . 
his early love for literature and history remain with him for his entire life . 
in 1793 the brother decide to enter the group ( found in 1479 ) and the following spring find them at the university prepare to matriculate for the autumn session . 
while person devote himself to the science of medicine , physics , and astronomy , his brother study law . 
the brother continue to help each other during their study , share a joint purse , lodge together in the dormitory and dine together at the home of their aunt . 
they supplement their income by small government assistance , by tutor and economize wherever they could . 
so impressive be those serious year of study at the university that person later write , `` to be perfectly free , the young man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and imagination ; there be a struggle there , in which , if he fall , it be easy for him to rise again , there be freedom of utterance there , which draw after it no irreparable consequence on society . 
i live in this onward driving contest where each day overcome a new difficulty , gain a new truth , or banish a previous error '' . 
he openly proclaim his pleasure in lecture and write_about science . 
in_this third year at the university , person , in 1797 , was award the first important token of recognition , a gold medal for his essay on `` limits_of_poetry_and_prose '' . 
he complete his training in pharmacy also , take his degree with high honor in 1797 , and in 1799 was award the degree of doctor_of_philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine . 
he propose a fresh theory of alkali which later was accept in chemical practice . 
person 's student day be at_a time when europe be in a new intellectual ferment follow the revolution in america and in france , germany and italy were rise from divisive nationalism and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweep the continent . 
the new century open with person begin his professional career in_charge of an apothecary shop in copenhagen and as lecturer at the university . 
he was stir by the announcement of person 's discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately apply the voltaic_pile to experiment with acid and alkali . 
the following year he devote to the customary `` wanderjahr '' , travel in germany , france , and the_netherlands , meet the philosopher person , person , and person . 
he also meet person ( bear person in location . ) who was then serve the person , and the physicist person ; these be person 's main contact in science . 
from location ^ ttingen ( 1801 ) where he stay for 10 day , he write , `` the first question ask everywhere be about galvanism . 
as everybody be curious to see the battery of glass tube i have invent , i have had quite a small one make here of four glass tube ( in copenhagen i use 30 ) and intend to carry it with me '' . 
person join person at location and stay with him for 3 week , continue their correspondence after he leave . 
with person he was expose to the fantastic profusion of idea that storm through his host 's fertile but disorganized mind . 
person remodel person 's note into an essay in french which was submit to the group for its annual prize of 3000 franc . 
the sound discovery of_this quixotic genius were so dilute by those of fantasy that the prize was never award to him . 
in may , 1803 , person , in another flight of fancy , write to person a letter that contain a remarkable prophecy . 
he relate event on earth to periodic celestial phenomenon and indicate that the year of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincide with the year of important electrical discovery . 
thus , 1745 correspond to the invention of the `` leiden_jar '' jar by person , 1764 that of the electrophorus by person , 1782 produce the condenser of person , and 1801 the voltaic_pile . 
person proceed , `` you now emerge into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820 , you will have to reckon . 
this we might well witness '' . 
person die in 1810 and person not_only live to see the event occur but be the author of it . 
in 1803 person return to copenhagen and apply for the university 's chair in physics but was reject because he was probably consider more a philosopher than a physicist . 
however , he continue experiment and lecture , publishing the result of his experiment in german and danish periodical . 
in 1806 his ambition was realize and he become professor of physics at the group , though not realize full professorship ( ordinarius ) until 1817 . 
during person 's attendance at the university , it was poorly equip with physical apparatus for experiment in the science . 
he be , however , fortunate in his contact with person ( 1769 - 1842 ) , teacher of chemistry , who , in_addition to his academic chair , be also proprietor of the `` lion_pharmacy '' in copenhagen where person assist him . 
person maintain a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which be at person 's disposal during and after his graduation . 
in 1800 , person go abroad and person was appoint manager of the lion_pharmacy . 
in february 1801 , person did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and report experiment make with a voltaic_battery of 600 plate of zinc and silver and of later experiment with a battery of 60 plate of zinc and lead . 
in the following year , 1803 , person , simultaneously with person , discover that acid increase the strength of a voltaic_battery more_than did salt . 
eager as he be to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded_down with the management of the pharmacy and lecture in the medical and pharmaceutical faculty at the university that he could devote only sunday afternoon to `` galvanizing '' . 
he assume his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had mark every step in his rise from boyhood . 
the university be the only one in denmark and the status of professor represent the upper social level . 
his broad interest in literary , political , and philosophical movement open many door to him . 
his friend be numerous and their tie to him be strong . 
the year 1812 and 1813 see him in germany and france again , but on this visit to berlin he did not seek_out the philosopher as he had on his first journey . 
in berlin he publish his view of the chemical law_of_nature in german and this was issue in french translation ( paris , 1813 ) under the title recherches_sur_l_'_identite_des_forces_chimiques_et_electriques , a work hold in very high esteem by the new generation of research chemist . 
his interest in find a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicate . 
chapter 8 , is entitle `` on_magnetism '' and in it are include such remark as , `` one has always been tempt to compare the magnetic_force with the electrical force . 
the great resemblance between electrical and magnetic_attraction and repulsion and the similarity of their law necessarily would bring_about this comparison . 
it be true , that nothing has been find comparable_with electricity by communication ; but the phenomenon observe have such a degree of analogy to those depending_on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest difference . 
the form of galvanic activity be halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form . 
there , force be more latent than in electricity , and less than in magnetism . 
but in such an important question , we would be satisfied if the judgment be that the principal objection to the identity of force which produce electricity and magnetism be only a difficulty , and not a thing which be contrary to_it . 
one could also add to these analogy that steel lose its magnetism by heat , which prove that steel become a better conductor through a rise in temperature , just as electrical body do . 
it is also find that magnetism exist in all body of nature , as prove by person and person . 
by that , one feel that magnetic_force be as general as electrical force . 
an attempt should be make to see if electricity , in its most latent stage , have any action on the magnet as_such '' . 
his plan and intent were clearly chart . 
person return in 1814 and resume an active part in university and political discussion . 
in one debate he support the freedom of judgment as_opposed_to dogma , in another he hold that the practice of science be in_fact an act of religious worship . 
he continue as a popular lecturer . 
he devise a detonating_fuse in which a short wire was cause to glow by an electric_current . 
in 1819 under royal command he undertake a very successful geological expedition to location , one of the danish island , be one of three scientist in the expedition . 
it was with the assistance of one of the member of_this expedition , person , that person succeed in produce light by create an electric_discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric_current was make to flow . 
together they also develop a new form of voltaic_cell in which the wooden trough was replace by one of copper , thereby produce strong current . 
person be among those who witness person 's first demonstration of his discovery . 
the association between electric ( both electrostatic and voltaic ) force and magnetic_force had been recognize by investigator for many decade . 
electrical literature contain numerous reference to lightning that had magnetize iron and had alter the polarity of compass needle . 
in the late 1700 's person and person , among others , had magnetize iron by send an electrostatic charge through it . 
person had almost stumble on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a leyden_jar was send transversally through a piece of watch spring steel make its end magnetic . 
the resulting magnetic effect prove strong than when the discharge was make lengthwise . 
the experiment of person and_others have already been note but no one had determine the cause and effect relationship between these two primary force . 
person 's own earlier experiment be unimpressive , possibly because he had , like other experimenter , lay the conducting_wire across the compass needle instead_of parallel with_it . 
the sequence of event lead to his important discovery still remain ambiguous but it seem that one of the advanced student at the university relate that the first direct event that lead to the publication of person 's discovery occur during a private lecture make before a group of other advanced student in the spring of 1820 . 
at this lecture person happen to place the conducting_wire over and parallel to a magnetic_needle . 
know specifically what the many feed additive can do and_how and when to feed them can make a highly competitive business more profitable for beef_man , dairyman , and sheepman . 
the target chart quickly and briefly tell you which additive do what . 
all the additive list here are sanction for use by the group of the federal_government . 
all comment concern effectiveness and use of drug have been carefully review by a veterinary medical officer with group .

additive should not be feed 72 hour before animal are slaughter . 
there be three principal feed_bunk type for dairy_cattle and beef_cattle : ( 1 ) fence_line bunk - cattle eat from one side while feed is put_in from the opposite side of the fence by self unloading wagon ; ( 2 ) mechanized bunk - they sit within the feedlot , are fill by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface ; ( 3 ) special bunk - as discuss here , they permit cattle to eat from all side . 
feed is put_in with an elevator . 
several material or combination of material can be use to construct a satisfactory feed_bunk . 
the selection of material depend_on skill of available labor for installation , cost of material available locally , and your own preference . 
no one material be best for all situation . 
select bunk by economic comparison be usually an individual problem . 
animal eat only from one side , so the fence_line bunk must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk . 
these bunk also serve as a fence , so part of the additional cost must be attribute to the fence . 
because of their location , on the edge of the feedlot , fence_line bunk be not in_the_way_of mechanical manure removal . 
fill these bunk by the same self unloading wagon use to fill silo spread cost of the wagon over more time and operation . 
all-weather road must be provide next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all year . 
this will be a problem in area of heavy snowfall . 
marketing in the new decade will be no picnic - for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experience in the last 20 - 25 yr . 
why ? 
company of all type have make great advance in production capability and efficiency - in modern equipment and new process , enlarged r_+_d facility , fast new product development . 
many company have upgrade their sale manpower and test new selling , distribution , and promotion technique to gain a bigger competitive edge . 
given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problem will your company face in the next 10 yr ? 
based on our experience with client , we see 14 major problem which fall_into three broad group - the marketplace itself , marketing method , and marketing management . 
there has been an intensification of price consciousness in recent year ; there is every indication it will continue . 
frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price consciousness has been foster by manufacturer , distributor , and dealer . 
despite generally good level of income , we see great price pressure than ever before - travel back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer . 
here are some key area to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target : 
has the probable price situation in your field been forecast as a basis for future planning ? 
have cost study been make of every phase of your operation to determine what might be do if thing get worse ? 
have you actually check_out ( not just mentally test ) different selling approach design to counter the price competition problem ? 
average consumer is become more sophisticated regarding product and advertising claim , partly because of widespread criticism of such assertion . 
this problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kind of business . 
have you examine this problem of increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company ? 
need for service be here to stay - and the problem is going_to be tough to solve in the sixties . 
there are two reason for this . 
first , most product tend to become more complex . 
second , in a competitive market , the customer feel his weight and throw it around . 
provide good customer service require as thorough a marketing and general management planning job as the original selling of the product . 
too often it is think_of at the last moment of new product introduction . 
good service start with product design and planning : 
many product seem to be design for a production economy , not for a service one . 
proper follow-through require train your own sale organization , and your distributor organization , not_only in the technique but also in good customer relations . 
have you assess the importance of service and give it proper attention ? 
in spend his money today , the consumer is pull in many direction . 
to the manufacturer of the more convenient type product - the purchase of which can be switch , delay , or put_off entirely - the implication be important . 
your competition be now proportionately greater - you are compete not_only against manufacturer in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturer of other appealing consumer product . 
many industry trade association are develop campaign to protect or enhance the share of the consumer 's dollar being spend on their particular product . 
has your company think through its strategy in this whole `` discretionary buying '' area ? 
the trend have be in_evidence for many year - population_shift to the location and location , and from city to suburb . 
these population_shift will continue in the next 10 yr . 
have you consider the implication of continuing geographic population_shift in_terms_of sales_force allocation , strength of distributor organization , and even plant location ? 
we have already witness great change through merger and acquisition in the food industry - at both the manufacturing and retail end . 
instead of relatively small sale to many account , there are now larger sale to or through fewer account . 
the change may require different product , pricing , packaging , warehousing , salesmanship , advertising and executive attention - practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjust . 
have you examine these trend , forecast the effect , and plan your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing circumstance ? 
in the area of private label competition , it be logical to expect a continuation of trend which have be underway during the first decade . 
as mass dealer and distributor organization grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share_in the manufacturer 's as_well as the distributor 's profits - which be , in_effect , what the sale of private brand tend to do . 
average manufacturer frequently has help build private brand business , deliver largely the same quality and style in private brand merchandise as in branded . 
moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlet and chain_store have insist on high_quality - and the customer seem to have catch_on . 
if you be up_against private brand competition , have you formulate a long-term program for research and strengthen your market position ? 
if private brand competition has n't been feel in your product field as_yet , have you think how you will cope with it if and when it does appear ? 
display merchandising , back by pre selling through advertising and promotion , will continue to make stride in the sixties . 
it have multiple implication and possible headache for your marketing program . 
how can you cash_in_on this fast-growing type of outlet and still maintain relationship with old existing outlet which be still important ? 
if you have a high quality product , how can you make it stand_out - justify its premium price - without the spoken word ? 
salesmanship be still necessary , but it be a different brand of salesmanship . 
have you carefully examine the selling technique which best suit your product ? 
have you study the caliber and sale approach of your sales_force in_relation_to requirement for effective marketing ? 
are you experiment with different selling slant in develop new customer ? 
some distribution cost are keep up by competitive pressure , some by the fact that the customer have come to expect certain nicety and flourish . 
no manufacturer has take the initiative in point_out the cost involved . 
the use of bulk handling is continuously grow . 
computer are being use to keep branch inventory at more workable level . 
`` selective selling '' - concentrate sale on the larger account - has been use effectively by some manufacturer . 
there may be possible economy at any one of a number of link in your marketing and distribution chain . 
do you have a program for scrutinize all these link regularly and carefully - and with some imagination ? 
in your sales_force , will a smaller number of high-priced , high quality salesman serve you best , or can you make_out better with a larger number of low paid salesman ? 
will your trade customer settle for less attention and fewer frills in_return_for some benefit they can share ? 
in one company cover the country with a high quality sales_force of 10 men , the president personally phone each major account every 6 month . 
as a result , distribution_cost were cut , customer relations improve . 
distribution_cost be almost bind to increase in the sixties - and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative way of do the job . 
from the manufacturer 's point_of_view , the increasing cost of advertising and promotion be a very real problem to be face in the sixties . 
it is accentuate by the need for pre selling goods , and private label competition . 
how much fundamental thinking and research has your company do on its advertising program ? 
are you follow competition willy-nilly - try to match dollar for dollar - or are you experiment with new means for reach and influence consumer ? 
have you evaluate the proper place of advertising and all phase of promotion in your total marketing program - from the standpoint of effort , money , and effectiveness ? 
practically all forecast mention new and exciting product on the horizon . 
will you be out in the marketplace with some of these sale building new product ? 
if competition beat you to_it , this exciting new product era can have real headache in_store . 
on_the_other_hand , the process of obsoleting an old product and introduce the new one be usually mighty expensive . 
as market become larger and marketing more complex , the cost of an error become progressively larger . 
is your r_+_d or product development program tuned in to the commercial reality of the market ? 
are there regular communication from the field , or meeting of sale and marketing personnel with r_+_d people ? 
technical knowledge be a wonderful thing , but it be useless unless it eventually feed the cash_register . 
are there individual in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization ; who can develop reliable estimate of sale volume , production , and distribution_cost ; and translate the whole into profit_and_loss and balance_sheet figure which management can act_on with some assurance ? 
we have see good new product shelve because no one have the assignment to develop such fact and plan - and management could n't make_up_one's_mind . 
there is a shortage of salesman today . 
in the future , quantitative demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy , and the qualitative need will be greater still . 
while many company have do fine work in develop sale personnel , much of it has be product rather than sale training . 
nor has the training be enough in_relation_to the need . 
most marketing people agree it is going_to take redoubled effort to satisfy future requirement . 
have you estimate your sale manpower need for the future ( both quantitatively and qualitatively ) ? 
has your company develop selection and training process that are gear to provide the caliber of salesman you will need in the next 10 yr ? 
with the growing complexity of market and intensity of competition , sale management , whether at the district , region or headquarters level , be a tough job today - and it will be tough in_the future . 
men qualified for the broad task of marketing manager be even more scarce due_to the demanding combination of qualification call_for by this type of management work . 
the growth of business has outdistance the available supply , and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties . 
does your company have a program for select and develop sale and marketing management_personnel for the long term ? 
does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep topnotch marketing people ? 
every single problem touch_on thus_far be related to good marketing planning . 
`` hip-pocket '' tactic are going_to be hard to apply . 
many food and beverage company be already on a highly planned basis . 
they have to be . 
with greater investment in plant facility , with automation growing , you can n't switch around , either in volume or in product design , as much as be formerly possible - or at_least not as economically . 
are planning and strategy development emphasize sufficiently in your company ? 
we find too many sale and marketing executive so burdened with detail that they are short-change planning . 
are annual marketing plan review throughout your management group to get the perspective of all individual and get everyone on the marketing team ? 
do you have a long-term ( 5 - or 10 - yr . ) marketing program ? 
the key to effective marketing be wrapped_up in define your company 's marketing problem realistically . 
solution frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problem , whether they be in the market , in marketing method or in marketing management . 
if company will take the time to give objective consideration to their major problem and to the question they provoke , then a long constructive step will have been take toward more effective marketing in next decade . 
how long has it be since you review the objective of your benefit and service program ? 
have you permit it to become a giveaway program rather than one that have the goal of improved employee morale and , consequently , increased productivity ? 
what effort do you make to assess result of your program ? 
do you measure its relation_to reduced absenteeism , turnover , accident , and grievance , and to improved quality and output ? 
have you set specific objective for your employee publication ? 
is it reach these goal ? 
be it larger or fancy than you really need ? 
are you use the most economical printing method , paper , etc. . 
be there other , cheap communication technique that could be substitute ? 
has your attitude toward employee benefit encourage an excess of free `` government '' work in your plant ? 
is your purchasing_agent offer too_much free buying service for employee ? 
when improvement are recommend in working condition - such_as lighting , restroom , eating facility , air-conditioning - do you try to set a measure of their effectiveness on productivity ? 
when negotiate with your union , do you make sure employee have a choice between new benefit and their cent per hour cost in wage . 
can you consider restrict any additional employee benefit to those pay for by profit_sharing money , such_as was do in the union contract recently sign by group ? 
do your employee understand all the benefit to which your insurance entitle them ? 
are they encourage to take_advantage full legal advantage of these benefit ? 
have you publicize the cent per hour value of the company 's share of insurance_premium ? 
when did you last compare your present premium cost with the cost of insurance from other source ? 
can your insurance_company aid you in reduce administrative cost ? 
do you try to maintain the principle of employee contribute ( as oppose to fully company paid ) program ? 
do you protect your holiday privilege with an attendance requirement both before and after the holiday ? 
do you plan to limit additional holiday to area and / or industrial pattern ? 
have you investigate the possibility of move midweek holiday forward to monday or back to friday in_order to have an uninterrupted work week ? 
are you carefully police washup time and rest period to be certain that all other time be productive ? 
are you watch work schedule for boiler operator , guard , and other 24 - hour day , 7 - day week operation in_order to minimize overtime ? 
are you careful to restrict the number of people on_leave at_one_time so that your total employment obligation be minimized ? 
have you consider use vending equipment to replace or reduce the number of cafeteria employee ? 
what be the possibility for operate your cafeteria for a single shift only and rely_upon vending_machine or prepackaged sandwich for the second - and third shift operation ? 
have you check the cost of subcontract your cafeteria operation in_order to save administrative cost ? 
are there possibility of having cafeteria help work part-time on custodial or other job ? 
can stagger lunch period relieve the capacity strain on your feeding facility ? 
would it be feasible to limit the menu in_order to reduce feeding cost ? 
have you consider gradual withdrawal of subsidy to your in plant feeding operation ? 
are you utilize cafeteria space for company meeting or discussion ? 
are your expense in this area commensurate with the number of employee who benefit from your program ? 
have you audit your program recently to weed_out those phase that draw least participation ? 
do employee contribute their share of money to recreational_facility ? 
have you consider delegate operational responsibility to your employee association and carefully restrict your plant 's financial contribution ? 
could an employee 's garden club take_over partial care of plant grounds ? 
would a camera club be useful in take picture pertinent to plant safety ? 
are you spending too much money on team uniform that benefit only a_few employee ? 
are you underwrite expensive team trip ? 
are you utilize vending_machine proceeds to help pay for your program ? 
do you know the trend in your cost of maintain access_road and parking_lot ? 
if you use parking attendant , can they be replace by automatic parking gate ? 
will your local bus_company erect and / or maintain the bus_stop at your plant ? 
if you provide inter plant transportation , can this be replace by available public transportation ? 
if you use company transportation to meet train or to haul visitor , would taxi be cheap ? 
how efficient and necessary be your intra company vehicle ? 
can they be reschedule ? 
can part-time driver be assign to other productive work ? 
which be more economical for your plant - a vacation shutdown or spaced vacation that require extra employee for vacation fill-in ? 
can vacation be space throughout the 12 month to minimize the number of employee fill-in ? 
do you insist that unneeded salary employee take their vacation during plant shutdown ? 
what can your sale and purchasing_department do to curtail order , shipment , and receipt during vacation shutdown period ? 
is an arbitrary retirement age of 65 actually cost your plant money ? 
what sort of effort do you make to assure that old or disabled worker be fully productive ? 
would early retirement of nonproductive , disabled employee reduce the number of make-work job ? 
will your union accept seniority concession in assign work for old or disabled employee ? 
can you share medical facility and staff with neighboring plant ? 
if you have a full-time doctor now , can he be replace with a part-time doctor or one who serve on a fee per case basis only ? 
can your plant nurse be replace by a trained first_aid man who work full-time on some_other assignment ? 
do you rigidly distinguish between job - and non job connected health_problem and avoid treat the latter ? 
are you indiscriminately offer unnecessary medical services - flu shot , sun lamp treatment , etc. ? 
if you have an annual or regular physical examination program , be it worth what it is cost you ? 
consider what you can afford to spend and what your goal be before set_up or revamp your employee benefit program . 
too many plant official be all_too eager to buy a package program from an insurance_company simply because it work for another plant . 
but even if that other plant employ the same number of worker and make the same product , there be other fact to consider . 
how old be your working force ? 
what 's your profit_margin ? 
in what section of the country be you located ? 
be you in a rural or urban_area ? 
these factor can make the difference between waste and efficiency in any benefit program . 
above_all , do n't set_up extravagant fringe_benefit just to buy employee good_will . 
union stress fringe_benefit , but the individual hourly worker prefer cash every time . 
aim to balance your employee benefit package . 
some plant go overboard on one type of fringe - say a liberal retirement plan - and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere . 
they 're ask_for union trouble . 
if you want credit for your employee services program , let your worker know what they 're entitle to . 
encourage them to exercise their benefit . 
this can be do by story in your house_organ , poster , special publication , letter to worker ' home as_well_as by_word_of_mouth through your chain of command . 
some company find a little imagination helpful . 
group , kansas_city , missouri , have a do-it-yourself quiz game called `` benefit_bafflers '' , which it distribute to employee . 
group , columbus , give all its worker a facsimile checkbook - each check show the amount the company spend on a particular fringe . 
group , new_york , pass out a form itemize the value of benefit . 
the blue-collar worker thus know his insurance package , for_example , cost $ 227.72 . 
have the insurance_company or your own accounting department break_down the cost of your insurance package periodically . 
you may find certain coverage cost much more_than be economically feasible , thereby alert you to desirable revision . 
check to see if some of your benefit - such_as on_the_job disability pay - can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a saving to you . 
use deductible insurance wherever feasible . 
it can put an end to marginal claim which play havoc with your insurance rate . 
also , beware of open-ended policy , especially in the medical field . 
this will mean that every time there 's an increase in hospital rate your cost will go_up in like manner . 
put a dollar and cent limit on benefit . 
do n't go overboard on insurance that pay benefit only upon death . 
generally , your employee will greatly appreciate benefit that protect him during his working life or during retirement . 
in grant bereavement leave , specify the maximum time_off and list what the worker 's relation to the deceased must be to qualify . 
thus , you avoid headache when an employee want off for his fourth cousin 's funeral . 
also , reserve the right to demand proof of death despite the fact that you 'll probably never use it . 
coffee_break can be a real headache if not regulated . 
vending_machine can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting waste of production time . 
if coffee is sell at the cafeteria , let a_few worker in each department get it for the whole group . 
consider install supplemental serve line in production area . 
make sure milk for the coffee is place in dispenser rather than in container , if you are supply the coffee . 
otherwise , you may be saddle with a good size milk bill by milk drinker . 
keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsman such_as tool and die maker can be keep on_the_job for the convenience of the company . 
and so deadhead on the payroll can be ease out at the earliest possible age . 
make sure you have minimum age and time on_the_job requirement tie into your pension plan . 
young men usually do n't think_of pension as an important job benefit factor anyhow and they be liable to change job several time before settle_down . 
choose carefully between contributory or non contributory pension plan . 
there be two side of a coin for this decision . 
worker usually think_of more of a plan they contribute to . 
and they can at_least collect the money they put_in , plus interest , when they leave the company . 
a non contributory plan usually won n't pay_off for the worker until he retire . 
thus , there be an added incentive to stay on_the_job . 
make sure you do n't pay for holiday that occur when an employee would not otherwise be work . 
these include : 
leave_of_absence , illness , and layoff . 
consider adopt a system of holiday in which time_off is grant with an eye to minimum inconvenience to the operation of the plant . 
it 's usually not too hard to sell worker on this as it give them longer holiday period . 
for_example , the friday after thanksgiving can be substitute for washington 's birthday . 
this reduce the number of expensive plant shutdown and startup . 
require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay . 
this cut the absentee_rate . 
consider use vending_machine rather than subsidize cafeteria . 
latest model serve hot meal at reasonable price , and at a profit to you . 
if a concessionaire run the cafeteria , keep_an_eye_on an eye out for quality and price . 
if the soup taste like dishwater , your employee won n't blame the concessionaire . 
you 'll take the rap . 
check your cafeteria location to make sure it be convenient for most employee . 
you may save valuable production minute with a change . 
spread your vacation period over the wide possible span of time or shut_down the plant down for two_weeks . 
this will cut the expense of vacation replacement . 
and with the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who get the choice vacation date . 
also make sure you have reasonable requirement as to hours work before a production employee be entitled to a vacation . 
you might try provide standard vacation time_off but make the vacation pay depend_on the number of hours work in the previous year . 
the long and ever increasing column of sportsman is now move_into a new era . 
modern_times have change the world beyond recognition . 
the early year of the twentieth century seem very faraway . 
but with all the change in philosophy , dress and terrain - a_few thing remain constant , include the devotion of american to the great field_sport , hunting and fishing . 
as the generation move_on , clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sport . 
sporting firearm change , markedly for the better . 
just as modern transportation has outmode the early studebaker covered_wagon , the demand of today 's sportsman and sportswoman has necessitate change in their equipment . 
the american firearm and ammunition manufacturer through diligent research and technical development have replace the muzzle_loader and slow fire single shot arm with modern fast fire autoloader , extremely accurate bolt , lever , and slide_action firearm . 
and millions of round of entirely new and modern small-arm ammunition , design for today 's hunting and target shooting . 
and due_to modern resource use and game management practice , there be still game to shoot , even with the ever expanding encroachment on land and water . 
present conservation practice regard wildlife , not as an expendable natural_resource , but as an annual harvest to be sow and also reap . 
unlimited game bag be possible and legal in more_than 40 state , on shooting_preserve ( one of the new phase of modern game management ) for five and six month each_year . 
close to two million game_bird were harvest on 1500 commercial and private shooting_preserve , and on group controlled upland game area during the 1960 - 61 season . 
the shooting development program of the group has successfully publish these fact in all major outdoor magazine , many national weekly and the trade paper . 
the most effective way to develop more place for more sportsman to shoot be to encourage properly manage shooting_preserve . 
this has be the aim of the director of the shooting development program , the new_york staff of the group , and the group shooting_preserve field consultant since the start of the program in 1954 . 
follow the kickoff of group 's shooting development program in 1954 , a most interesting meeting take_place in washington , district_of_columbia . 
the group known_as the group ( a division of the group ) initiate a conference which bring_together representative of the group , group and the group . 
this meeting was call to determine how these group might cooperate to launch what be known_as the outdoor_education_project . 
the outdoor_education_project take cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activity stress in most school program have little or no relationship to the physical and mental need and interest of later life . 
the various team sport assuredly have their place in every school , and they be important to proper physical development . 
but with the exception of professional athlete , few contact_sport and physical_education activity in our school have any carry-over in the adult life of the average american man or woman . 
follow a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by oep director person , today thousand of secondary_school , college and university have shooting and hunting education in their physical_education and recreation program . 
group 's financial support since 1955 has contribute to the success of this project in education . 
personnel assign through the shooting development program have proudly participate in over 53 state and regional workshop , at which hundred of school administrator , teacher , professor , and recreational leader have been introduce to outdoor education . 
consider that the current school age potential be 23 million youth , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many_more to reach . 
in 1959 group 's shooting development program announce a new activity design to expose thousand of teenage boy and girl to the healthy fun enjoy through the participation in the shooting sport . 
this program is now nationally known_as `` teen hunter club '' . 
teen hunter club were initially sponsor by affiliated member of the group . 
the first program was sponsor by group , location , new_york , under the direction of special event director person . 
other pilot_program were conduct by group , location , new_york ; group , detroit ; group , pittsburgh . 
other group activity follow , conduct by shopping_center , department_store , recreation equipment dealer , radio - tv station , newspaper , and other organization interested in the need exist to acquaint youngster with the proper use of sporting firearm and the development of correct attitude and appreciation related_to hunting and wise use of our natural_resources . 
group 's field men have serve as consultant and / or have participate in 75 teen hunter club activity which have reach over 40000 enthusiastic young american . 
through the effort of group 's shooting development program these shooting activity , and many others , include assist in the development of public and privately financed shoot park , trap and skeet league , rifle and pistol marksmanship program have been promote , to mention only a_few . 
the continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be make aware of the ever growing need for shooting facility and activity for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand . 
while individual sportsman be aware of this situation , too many_of our political , social , educational and even religious leader too often forget it . 
help be needed from dealer , at the grassroots level . 
the american gun and ammunition producer sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association . 
since group 's conception in 1926 , and more specifically since the adoption of the shooting development program in 1954 , millions of dollar and promotional man_hour have go_into the development of more place to_shoot for more youth and adult . 
we trust that you , as a gun and ammunition dealer , have benefit through additional sale of equipment . 
are you get top dollar from the shooting sport ? 
are you look ahead to the exploding market of millions of american boy and girl , who will grow_up to enjoy a traditional american way_of_life - range the field with a fine american gun and uniformly excellent ammunition ? 
be your sporting firearm and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizon ? 
would you like to organize teen hunter club , shooting program , and have information on season include six month of hunting with unlimited game bag on shooting_preserve ? 
ask person . 
we were camp a_few week ago on location in that land of pirate , seagull and bluefish on north_carolina 's famed location . 
this beach campground with no tree or hill present a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in_use actual use . 
with the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelter in which american are camp now . 
there were umbrella_tent , wall_tent , cottage_tent , station_wagon tent , pup_tent , pop_tent , baker tent , tent with exterior frame , camper_trailer , travel_trailers , and even a_few surplus parachute serve as sunshade over entire family camp . 
move around camp we see all kind of camp stove , lantern , cooler , bedding , game , fishing_tackle , windbreak and sunshade . 
we see similar display in the other three campground in this 70 mile long national_seashore_recreation_area . 
dealer would do_well to visit such a campground often , look at the equipment and talk with the camper . 
here you begin to appreciate the scope of the challenge and possibility face the industry . 
camping be big and get big . 
no one know where it will stop . 
almost every official who reflect on_it think this movement of american to canvas dwelling open one of the most promising of all outdoor market . 
you read various guess on how many american are camp . 
the number depend_on who is talk at the moment . 
the figure range as high as 15 million family . 
i 've hear 10 million mention often , but i be more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million family camping . 
seven million family would total 30 million american or more . 
consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather , to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable . 
harassed state park official often have more camper than they know what to do with . 
they are struggle to meet the demand for camping space , but family are being turn_away , especially on holiday weekend . 
the national_park , always popular camping place , are face the same pressure . 
the national_park_service hope by 1966 to have 30000 campsite available for 100000 camper a day - almost twice what there are at_present . 
the group care for hundred of thousand of camper in its 149 national forest and is increase its facility steadily . 
but the camper still come . 
they bring their family and tent and camp kitchen and bedding . 
they bring their fishing_rod and binoculars and bathing_suit . 
they come prepared for family fun because american in ever growing number are learn that here be the way to a fine economical vacation that become a family experience of lasting importance . 
there are a half_dozen reason help to account_for the migration to the campground . 
among them , according to the u.s. department_of_commerce , be : ( 1 ) short workweek , ( 2 ) high pay , ( 3 ) long paid_vacation , ( 4 ) better transportation , ( 5 ) early retirement , and ( 6 ) more education . 
the more people learn about their country , the more they want to learn . 
camping be family fun , and it is help more american see more of the country than they ever see before . 
but make no mistake about it , the first reason people turn_to camping be one of economy . 
here be the promise of a vacation trip they can afford . 
the group , compute the cost for two people to vacation by automobile , come_up with an average daily expenditure figure of $ 29 . 
the group then split it down this way : $ 10.50 for meal , $ 9.50 for lodging , $ 7 for gas and oil , and $ 2 for tip and miscellaneous . 
what does the camping couple do to this set of figure ? 
the $ 9.50 for lodging they save . 
because they prepare their own meal they also keep in their pocket a good portion of that $ 10.50 food bill along with most_of the tip money . 
the automobile expense be about the only vacationing cost they can n't either eliminate or pare_down drastically by camp along the way . 
where american used_to think_of a single vacation each summer , they now think_about how many vacation they can have . 
long weekend enable many to get_away from home for three or four day several time a year . 
and even if they stay in resort part of the time , they might , if the right salesman get them in tow , develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip into the wide open space . 
it would be a mistake to sell those thousand of beginning camper on the idea they 're buy the comforts of home . 
they 're not . 
home be the place to find the comforts of home . 
they 're buy fun and adventure and family experience . 
but it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable camping has become . 
this be no_longer a way_of_life for the bearded logger and the wandering cowboy . 
today 's camper want comforts , and they have them . 
and this help explain why so many people are now going camp . 
it be fun , and it be easy - so easy that there be time left after cooking , and tent keep , for the woman to get_out and enjoy outdoor fun with their family . 
camp meal be no great problem . 
neither be bed , thanks to air_mattress and sleeping_bag . 
neither be shelter , because there be one to meet the need of every camper or prospective camper . 
but there be still the sometimes complex problem of help camper choose the best equipment for their individual need . 
in tradition and in poetry , the marriage_bed be a place of unity and harmony . 
the partner each bring to it unselfish love , and each take_away an equal share of pleasure and joy . 
at its most ecstatic moment , husband and wife are elevate far above worldly care . 
everything else is close away . 
this be the ideal . 
but marriage expert say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieve . 
instead one partner or the other dominate the sexual_relationship . 
in the past , it has be the husband who has be dominant and the wife passive . 
but today there be sign that these role are being reverse . 
in a growing number of american home , marriage counselor report , the wife is take a commanding role in sexual_relationship . 
it be she who decide the time , the place , the surroundings , and the frequency of the sexual act . 
it be she who say aye or nay to the intimate question of sexual technique and mechanics - not the husband . 
the whole act is tailor to her pleasure , and not to theirs . 
beyond a certain point , of_course , no woman can be dominant - nature has see to that . 
but there be little doubt that in many marriage the wife be boss of the marital bed . 
of_course , there remain many `` old-fashioned '' marriage in which the husband maintain his supremacy . 
yet even in these marriage , psychologist say , wife are assert_oneself themselves more strongly . 
the meek , most submissive wife of today be a tiger by her mother 's or grandmother 's standard . 
to many expert , this trend be inevitable . 
they consider it simply a sign of our times . 
our society has `` emancipate '' the woman , give her new independence and new authority . 
it be only natural that she assert_oneself herself in the sexual role . 
`` the sexual_relationship does not exist in a vacuum '' , declare person , medical director of the group and author of the recent book , release from sexual tensions . 
`` it reflect what is go_on in other area of the marriage and in society itself . 
a world in which wife have take a more active role be likely to produce sexual_relationship in which wife be more self-assertive , too '' . 
yet many psychologist and marriage counselor agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous . 
it can , in_fact , wreck a marriage . 
when a husband be sexually selfish and heedless of his wife 's desire , she is cheat of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intend for her . 
and she begin to regard him as savage , bestial and unworthy . 
on_the_other_hand , wifely supremacy demean the husband , sap his self-respect , and rob him of his masculinity . 
he be a target of ridicule to his wife , and often - since private affairs rarely remain private - to the outside world as_well . 
`` a marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband 's maleness '' , declare person . 
this opinion is support by one of the nation 's leading psychiatrist , person , director of the group of the group . 
`` when the role of husband and wife are reverse , so that the wife become leader and the husband follower '' , person say , `` the effect on their whole relationship , sexual and otherwise , can be disastrous '' . 
in one extreme case , cite by a pittsburgh psychologist , an office worker 's wife refuse to have sexual_relation with her husband unless he buy her the luxury she demand . 
to win her favor , her husband first take an additional job , then desperately begin to embezzle from his employer . 
catch at_last , he was sentence to prison . 
while he be in custody his wife divorce him . 
more typical be the case of a suburban long_island housewife describe by a marriage counselor . 
this woman repeatedly complain she be `` too tired '' for marital relation . 
to please her , her husband assume some of the domestic chore . 
finally , he was cook , wash dish , bathing the child , and even iron - and still his wife refuse to have relation as often as he desire them . 
one wife , describe by a new_york psychologist , so dominate her husband that she actually placed their sexual_relationship on a schedule , write_down it down right between the weekly group meeting and the thursday night neighborhood card party . 
another put sex on a dollar and cent basis . 
after every money argument , she rebuff her husband 's overture until the matter was settle in her favor . 
expert say the partner in marriage like these can almost be type . 
the wife be likely to be young , sophisticated , smart_as_a_whip - often a girl who has sacrifice a promising career for marriage . 
she know the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband . 
the husband be usually a well-educated professional , preoccupy with his job - often an organization man whose motto for get_ahead be : `` do n't rock_the_boat '' . 
sometimes this lead to his become demandingly dominant in marriage . 
hem_in on the job and unable to assert_oneself himself , he use the sex_act so he can be supreme in at_least one area . 
more often , though , he be so accustomed to submit to authority on the job without argument that he live by the same rule at home . 
some psychologist , in_fact , suggest that career bound husband often be more to blame for topsy-turvy marriage than their wife . 
the wife 's attempt at control , these psychologist contend , be sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job . 
naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative . 
unless her husband also desire sex , the act cannot be consummate . 
generally , however , in such marriage as those cite , the husband be at his wife 's mercy . 
`` the pattern '' , say person , psychologist at new_york 's group , `` be for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly , virtually tremble in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight be the night '' . 
no one seriously contend , of_course , that the domineer wife be , sexually speak , a new character in our world . 
after_all , the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife be a comic figure of long standing , in literature and on the stage , as person point_out . 
there be no evidence that these milquetoast become suddenly emboldened when they cross the threshold of the master_bedroom . 
furthermore , person say , a certain number of docile , retiring man always have be around . 
they be n't `` frigid '' and they be n't homosexual ; they 're just restrained in all of life . 
they like to be dominate . 
one such man once confide to person , new_york psychiatrist , that he prefer to have his wife the sexual aggressor . 
ask why , he reply primly : 
`` because that 's no activity for a gentleman '' . 
but such case be , in the past , unusual . 
society here and abroad has been build around the dominating male - even the bible appear to endorse the concept . 
family survival on our own western frontier , for_example , could quite literally depend_on a man 's strength and ability to bring_home_the_bacon ; and the dependent wife seldom question his judgment about anything , include the marriage bed . 
this carry_over into the more urbanized late 19 th and early 20 th century , when the man rule the roost in the best bull_roaring life_with_father manner . 
in those day , a wife have mighty few right in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere . 
`` grandma was n't expect to like it '' , person , the late toronto gynecologist , once sum_up the attitude of the ' 90 s . 
wife of the period shamefacedly think_of themselves as `` used '' by their husband - and , history indicate , they often quite literally were . 
when be the turning_point ? 
when did woman begin to assert_oneself themselves sexually ? 
some date it from woman suffrage , others from when woman first begin to challenge man in the marketplace , still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub_gin . 
virtually everyone agree , however , that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerate with the postwar rush to the suburb . 
leave alone while her husband be mile away in the city , the modern wife assume more and more duty normally reserve for the male . 
circumstances give her almost undisputed sway over child rearing , money handling and home maintenance . 
she find she could cope_with all kind of problem for which she was once consider too helpless . 
she like this taste of authority and independence , and , with darkness , was not likely to give_up it up . 
`` very few wife '' , say person , `` who balance the checkbook , fix the car , choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesman , are suddenly going_to become submissive where sex is concern . 
a woman who dominate other family affairs will dominate the sexual_relationship as_well '' . 
and an additional factor was help to make woman more sexually self-assertive - the comparatively recent discovery of the true depth of female desire and response . 
marriage manual and woman 's magazine_article begin to stress the importance of the female climax . 
they begin to describe in_detail the woman 's capacity for response . 
in_fact , the noted psychologist and sex researcher , person , has declare flatly that woman be `` sexually superior '' to man . 
according to person , the average 20 - year old american woman be capable of far greater sexual_arousal than her partner . 
not surprisingly , person say , some recently enlightened wife be out_to claim these capability . 
yet , paradoxically , according to person , many wife despise their husband for not stand_up to them . 
an aggressive woman want a man to demand , not knuckle_under . 
`` when the husband become passive in_the_face_of his wife 's aggressiveness '' , person say , `` the wife , in_turn , find him inadequate . 
often she fail to gain sexual satisfaction '' . 
one such wife , person say , become disgusted with her weak husband and flurry through a series of extramarital affair in the hope of find a strong man . 
but her personality be such_that each affair last only until that lover , too , had been conquer and reduce to passivity . 
then the wife bed_hop to the next on the list . 
in some case , however , domination of the sex_act by one partner can be temporary , trigger by a passing but urgent emotional need . 
thus a man who is butting_a_stone_wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed - the one place he can still be champion . 
if his on_the_job problem work_out , he may return to his old pattern . 
sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep_over a man - or his wife - because he or she feel age creep_up . 
on_the_other_hand , a husband who always has be vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive - ask , psychologist say , for reassurance that his wife still find him desirable . 
or a wife may make sudden demand that she be court , flatter or coax , simply because she need her ego lift . 
in_any_case , person remark , such problem be a couple 's own affair , and can n't always be measure by a general yardstick . 
`` as_long_as the couple be in_agreement in their approach to sex , it make little difference if one or the other dominate '' , person declare . 
`` the important point be that both be satisfied with the adjustment '' . 
other expert say , however , that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exist for longer than a brief period , it be likely to shake the marriage . 
and just as domination today often begin with the wife , so the cure generally must lie with the husband . 
`` to get a marriage back where it belong '' , comment person of the group , `` the husband must take some very basic step . 
he must begin , paradoxically , by become more selfish . 
he must become more expressive of his own desire , more demanding and less ' understanding '' ' . 
too many husband , person continue , worry about `` how well they 're do '' , and fear that their success depend_on some trick or technique of sexual play . 
farming be confining . 
the farmer 's life must be arrange to meet the demand of crop and livestock . 
livestock must be tend every_day , routinely . 
a slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cow or chicken . 
even if there be no livestock , the farmer cannot leave the farm for long period , particularly during the growing_season . 
the worker who live on a farm cannot change job readily . 
he cannot leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice ; such a move may mean a loss of capital . 
hard physical labor and undesirable hours be a part of farm life . 
the farmer must get_up early , and , at_times , work late at night . 
frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain . 
no_matter how well work is plan , bad_weather or unexpected setback can cause extra work that must be catch_up . 
it may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the laborsaving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably . 
production may fall far below expectation . 
drought , hail , disease , and insect take their toll of crop . 
sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner 's earnings , even into his capital . 
return for money and labor invest may be small even in a good year . 
the high cost of land , supplies , and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis . 
land within commute distance of a growing city be usually high in price , high if it have subdivision possibility . 
part-time farmer generally must pay high price for supplies than full-time farmer because they buy in small quantity . 
if the farm be in an industrial area where wage be high , farm labor cost will also be high . 
a part-time farmer need unusual skill to get as high production per hen , per cow , or per acre as can be obtain by a competent full-time farmer . 
it will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment . 
he may have_to depend_on custom service for specialized operation , such_as spraying or threshing , and for these , he may have_to wait his turn . 
there will be loss cause by emergency that arise while he be away at his off farm job . 
the farm may be an additional burden if the main job is lose . 
this may be true whether the farm is own or rent . 
if the farm is rent , the rent must be pay . 
if it is own , tax must be pay , and if the place be not free_of mortgage , there will be interest and payment on the principal to take_care of . 
a farm provide a wholesome and healthful environment for child . 
it give them room to play and plenty of fresh air . 
the child can do chore adapt to their age and ability . 
care for a calf , a pig , or some chicken develop in child a sense_of_responsibility for work . 
part-time farming give a measure of security if the regular job is lose , provide the farm is own free_of debt and furnish enough income to meet fixed expense and minimum live cost . 
for some retired_person , part-time farming be a good way to supplement retirement income . 
it be particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out_of_doors for their health . 
generally , the same level of living cost less in the country than in the city . 
the saving be not as great , however , as is sometime suppose . 
usually , the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and utility somewhat more . 
where school , fire and police protection , and similar municipal services be of equal quality in city and country , real_estate tax be usually about the same . 
a part-time farmer and his family can use their spare_time profitably . 
some person consider the work on a farm recreational . 
for some white-collar worker it be a welcome change from the regular job , and a physical conditioner . 
part-time farming can take comparatively little land , labor , and equipment - or a great_deal . 
it depend_on the kind and the scale of the farming operation . 
general requirement for land , labor , and equipment are discuss below . 
specific requirement for each of various type of enterprise are discuss on page 8 to 14 . 
three quarter to 1 acre of good land be enough for raise fruit and vegetable for home use , and for a small flock of chicken , a cow , and two pig . 
you could not , of_course , raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small . 
if you want_to raise feed or carry_out some enterprise on a larger scale , you 'll need more land . 
in decide how much land you want , take_into_account the amount you 'll need to bring_in the income you expect . 
but consider also how much you and your family can keep_up along with your other work . 
the cost of land and the prospect for appreciation in value may influence your decision . 
some part-time farmer buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development . 
this be a highly speculative venture . 
sometimes a desired acreage is offer only as part of a larger tract . 
when surplus land be not expensive to buy or to keep_up , it be usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining property might impair the residential value of the farm . 
if you have a year-round , full-time job you can n't expect to grow much more than your family use - unless other member of the family do a good_deal of the work or you hire help . 
as a rule , part-time farmer hire little help . 
in decide on the enterprise to be manage by family labor , compare the amount of labor that can be supply by the family with the labor need of various enterprise list in table 1 . 
list the number of hour the family can be expect to work each_month . 
you may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one . 
do not include all your spare_time or all your family 's spare_time - only what you be willing to use for farm work . 
if you are going_to produce for home use only , you will need only hand_tool . 
you will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing , however . 
for larger planting , you 'll need some kind of power for plow , harrow , disk , and cultivate . 
if you have a planting of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor ( available for $ 300 to $ 500 with attachment , 1960 price ) . 
these tractor be not entirely satisfactory for plow , particularly on heavy soil , so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing . 
cost of power and machinery be often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer . 
if you are going_to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investment when you choose among farm enterprise . 
you can keep_down your machinery investment down by buy good secondhand machinery , by share the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor , and by hire someone with machinery to do certain job . 
if an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is need - such_as a spray rig , a combine , or a binder - it be better to pay someone with a machine to do the work . 
before you look_for a farm you 'll need_to know ( 1 ) the kind and scale of farming you want_to undertake ; and ( 2 ) whether you want_to buy or rent . 
information on page 8 to 14 may help you in decide on the kind and scale of your farming venture . 
if you be not well acquainted_with the area in which you wish_to locate , or if you be not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming , usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy . 
discuss below be some of the main thing to look_for when you select a part-time farm . 
choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunity . 
then if you change job you won n't necessarily have_to sell the farm . 
the presence of alternative job opportunity also will make the place easy to sell if that should become desirable . 
obviously the farm should be on an all weather road . 
if you grow anything to sell you will need market nearby . 
if you plan to sell fresh vegetable or whole milk , for_example , you should be close to a town or city . 
look_for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept home . 
there be slum in the country as_well as in the city . 
few rural_area are protect by zoning . 
a tavern , filling_station , junkyard , render plant , or some other business may go_up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value . 
check on the school in the area , the quality of teaching , and the provision for transportation to and from them . 
find_out whether fire protection , sewage_system , gas , water_main , and electrical line be available in the locality . 
if these facility be not at the door , get them may cost more_than you expect . 
you may have_to provide them yourself or get_along without them . 
you cannot get_along without an adequate supply of pure water . 
if you are consider a part-time farm where the water must be provide by a well , find_out if there be a good well on the farm or the probable cost of having one drill . 
a pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden . 
pond water can be filter for human use , but most part-time farmer would not want to go to so_much trouble . 
the following amount of water are need per day for livestock and domestic use . 
is the land suit to the crop you intend to raise ? 
if you can n't tell , get help from your county agricultural_agent or other local specialist . 
soil type , drainage , or degree of slope can make the difference between good crop and poor ones . 
small area that be n't right for a certain crop may lie next to area that be well suited to that crop . 
will the house on any part-time farm you are consider make a satisfactory full-time residence ? 
how much will it cost to do any necessary modernize and redecorate ? 
if the house be not wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central_heating system must be instal , check_into the cost of make these improvement . 
its worth as a place to live . 
the value of the product you can raise on it . 
the possibility of sell the property later_on for suburban subdivision . 
decide first what the place be worth to you and your family as a home in comparison with what it would cost to live in town . 
take_into_account the difference in city and county tax , insurance rate , utility rate , and the cost of travel to work . 
next , estimate the value of possible earnings of the farm . 
to do this , set_up a plan on_paper for operate the farm . 
list the kind and quantity of things the farm can be expect to produce in an average year . 
estimate the value of the produce at normal price . 
the total be the probable gross income from farming . 
to find estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming expenditure from probable gross income from farming . 
include as expenditure an allowance for depreciation of farm_building and equipment . 
also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contribute by the family . 
it may be hard to decide what this labor be worth , but charge something for it . 
otherwise , you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor . 
to figure the value of the farm in_terms_of investment income , divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invest in some other way . 
everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had_to be give his day in court as in some vast collective dirge . 
for almost two month , the defendant and the world hear from individual escape from the grave about father and mother , graybeard , adolescent , baby , starve , beat to death , strangle , machine_gun , gas , burn . 
one who had be a boy in location had_to tell how child had been select by height for the gas_chamber . 
the gruesome humor of the nazi was not forget - the gas_chamber with a sign on it with the name of a jewish foundation and bear a copper star_of_david - nor the gratuitous sadism of group officer . 
public_relations strategist everywhere , watch the reaction of the german press , the liberal press , the lunatic fringe press , listen to their neighbor , study interview with man and woman on the street , cry_out : too_much , too_much - the mind of the audience is become dulled , the horror are lose their effect . 
and still another witness , one who had crawl out from under a heap of corpse , had_to tell how the victim had been force to lie themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shoot . 
most_of this testimony may have be legally admissible as bear_on the corpus_delicti of the total nazi crime but seem subject_to question when not tie to the part in it of the defendant 's group . 
counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allow himself to be sweep by the current of dreadful recollection , rarely raise an objection . 
would not the emotional catharsis eventually bring_on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client 's chance ? 
those who fear `` emotionalism '' at the trial show less understanding than person of the route by which man achieve the distance necessary for fairness toward enemy . 
interruption come largely from the bench , which numerous time rebuke the attorney_general for let his witness run on , though it , too , make no serious effort to choke_off the flow . 
but there be a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the trial in jerusalem and those in moscow and new_york . 
in each of the last , the trial mark the beginning of a new course : in moscow the liquidation of the old bolshevik and the tightening of stalin 's dictatorship ; in the united_states the initiation of militant anti communism , with the repentant ex communist in the vanguard . 
these trial were properly term `` political case '' in_that the trial itself be a political act produce political consequence . 
but what could the person trial initiate ? 
of what new course could it mark the beginning ? 
the person case look_to the past , not to the future . 
it be the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection , and of refine the recollection , that will last as_long_as there be jew . 
as_such , it be beyond politics and have no need of justification by a `` message '' . 
`` it be not an individual that be in the dock at this historical trial '' - say person , `` and not the nazi regime alone - but anti-semitism throughout history '' . 
how could supply person with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of jew without be an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-semitism ? 
and if it be not an individual who be in the dock , why be the trial , as we shall observe later , all_but scuttle in the attempt to prove person a `` fiend '' ? 
these question touch the root of confusion in the prosecution 's case . 
it might be contend , of_course , that person in stubbornly deny anti-semitic feeling was lie or insist on a private definition of anti-semitism . 
but in either event he be the wrong man for the kind of case outline by person and set_forth in the indictment . 
in such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have_to be tie to the issue by argument . 
one who could be link to anti-semitism only by overcome his objection be scarcely a good specimen of the jew-baiter throughout the age . 
shout at person though he might , the prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsify the way he feel about jews or that what he did feel fall_into the generally recognized category of anti-semitism . 
yes , he believe that the jew be `` enemy of the reich '' , and such a belief be , of_course , typical of `` patriotic '' anti-semite ; but he believe in the jew as enemy in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a member of a cult speculate on the nature of thing . 
the real question be how one pass from anti-semitism of_this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be find in anti-semitism itself . 
in regard_to person , it was to be find in the nazi outlook , which contain a principle separate from and far worse than anti-semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-semitism itself was make more virulent . 
perhaps under the guidance of_this nazi principle one could , as person declare , feel personally friendly toward the jew and still be their murderer . 
not through fear of disobey order , as person keep try to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that begin in a half acceptance of the vicious absurdity contain in the nazi interpretation of history and grow with each of hitler 's victory into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that be able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` well , let 's try it '' . 
at_any_rate , the substance of person 's testimony be that all his action flow_from his membership in the party and the group , and though the prosecutor do his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of jew , his success on this score be doubtful and the anti-semitic lesson weakened to_that_extent . 
but if the trial did not expose the special nazi mania so deadly to jew as_well_as to anyone upon whom it happen to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-semitism of which the nazi make such effective use in germany and wherever else they could find it . 
if anti-semitism be on_trial in jerusalem , why was it not identify , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activity of person 's group , as exemplify by the betrayal and murder of jew by non police and nonparty anti-semite in germany , as_well_as in poland , czechoslovakia , hungary ? 
the infamous wansee_conference call by person in january 1942 , to organize the material and technical means to put_to_death the eleven million jew spread throughout the nation of europe , was attend by representative of major organ of the german state , include the person , the person in_charge of the four_year_plan , the person , the person . 
the measure for annihilation propose and accept at the conference affect industry , transportation , civilian agency of government . 
person , in open the conference , follow the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issue earlier by person which authorize the final_solution as `` a complement to '' previous `` solution '' for eliminate the jew from german living_space through violence , economic_strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation . 
in_other_words , the promulgator of the murder plan make clear that physically exterminate the jew be but an extension of the anti-semitic measure already operate in every phase of german life , and that the new conspiracy count_on the general anti-semitism that had make those measure effective , as a readiness for murder . 
this , in_fact , it turn_out to be . 
since the magnitude of the plan make secrecy impossible , once the wheels had begin to turn , person control german industry , social institution , and armed_forces become , through their anti-semitism or their tolerance of_it , conscious accomplice of hitler 's crime ; whether in the last degree or a lesser one be a matter to be determine individually . 
what more could be ask for a trial intend to warn the world against anti-semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable anti-semite and the concentration_camp brute ? 
not in person 's anti-semitism but in the anti-semitism of the sober german man_of_affairs lie the potential warning of the trial . 
no_doubt many_of the citizen of the third_reich had conceive their anti-semitism as an `` innocent '' dislike of jew , as do others like them today . 
the final_solution prove that the jew-baiter of any variety expose himself as be implicated in the criminality and madness of others . 
ought not an edifying trial have make every effort to demonstrate this once_and_for_all by show how representative type of `` mere '' anti-semite were draw step_by_step into the program of skull bash and gassing ? 
the prosecutor in his opening remark did refer to `` the germ of anti-semitism '' among the german which hitler `` stimulate and transform '' . 
but if there be evidence at the trial that aim over person 's head at his collaborator in the society where he function , the press seem to have miss it . 
nor did the trial devote much attention to expose the usefulness of anti-semitism to the nazi , both in build their own power and in destroy that of rival organization and state . 
certainly , one of the best way of warn the world against anti-semitism be to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon . 
person himself be a model of how the myth of the enemy jew can be use to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbor . 
do patriot everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the jew in germany and later in the occupied country contribute to terrorize the population , split apart individual and group , arouse the mean and most dishonest impulse , pulverize trust and personal dignity , and finally force people to follow their master into the abyss by make them partner in unspeakable crime ? 
the career of person make the trial a potential showcase for anti-semitic demoralization : 
fearful of being mistake for a jew , he seek protection in his nazi uniform ; cling to the enemy jew idea , he is force to overcome habit of politeness and neighborliness ; once in power he begin to give_vent to a criminal opportunism that cause him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . 
`` is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? the trial should have ask the nation . 
but though this characterization in_no_way diminish person 's guilt , the prosecutor , more deeply involve in the tactic of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of_it . 
finally , if the mission of the trial be to convict anti-semitism , how could it have fail to post before the world the contrasting fate of the country in which the final_solution was aid by native jew hater - i.e. , germany , poland , hungary , czechoslovakia - and those in which it meet the obstacle of human solidarity - denmark , holland , italy , bulgaria , france ? 
should not everyone have been awaken to_it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nation poison by anti-semitism prove less fortunate in regard_to their own freedom than those whose citizen save their jewish compatriot from the transport ? 
was n't this meaning of person 's experience in various country worth highlight ? 
as the first collective confrontation of the nazi outrage , the trial of person represent a recovery of the jew from the shock of the death camp , a recovery that take fifteen year and which be still by_no_means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hasten by silence ) . 
only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin . 
it be already difficult to recall how little we know before the trial of what had been done to the jew of europe . 
it be not that the fact of the persecution be unavailable ; most_of the information elicit in jerusalem had been bring to the surface by the numerous war_crime tribunal and investigating commission , and by report , memoir , and survivor ' account . 
in location , location , in 1952 , a roman_catholic hospital present seven protestant physician with an ultimatum to quit the group or to resign from the hospital staff . 
three agree , but four decline and were suspend . 
after a flood of protest , they were reinstate at the beginning of 1953 . 
the peace of the community was badly disturb , and people across_the_nation , read of the incident , feel uneasy . 
in new_york_city in 1958 , the city 's commissioner of hospital refuse to permit a physician to provide a protestant mother with a contraceptive_device . 
he thereby precipitate a bitter controversy involve protestant , jew and roman_catholic that continue for two month , until the city 's board of hospital lift the ban on birth_control therapy . 
a year later in albany , location , a roman_catholic hospital bar an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the group . 
immediately , the religious group of the city were embroil in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man 's right to freedom of religious_belief and conscience . 
these incident , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decade has cause more tension , rancor and strife among religious group in this country than the birth_control issue . 
it has flare_up periodically on the front page of newspaper in community divided over birth prevention regulation in municipal hospital and health and family welfare agency . 
it has erupt on the national level in the matter of include birth_control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped country . 
where it is not actually erupt , it rumble and smolder in sullen resentment like a volcano , ready to explode at any moment . 
the time has come for citizen of all faith to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation . 
the first_step toward the goal be the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good_will and friendly communication on other_than the polemical level . 
instead of emotional recrimination , loaded phrase and sloganeering , we need a dispassionate study of the fact , a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the area of agreement until a solution is reach . 
`` all_too frequently '' , point_out person , managing_editor of commonweal , `` catholic run_roughshod over protestant sensibility in this matter , by failure to consider the reasoning behind the protestant position and , particularly , by their jibe at the fact that protestant opinion on birth_control has change in recent decade '' . 
all_too often our language be unduly harsh . 
the second step be to recognize the substantial agreement - frequently blur by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting - already exist between catholic and non-catholic concern the overall objective of family_planning . 
instead of catholic ' be obliged or even encourage to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many non-catholic imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stress . 
family_planning is encourage , so that parent will be able to provide properly for their offspring . 
person , declare in 1951 that it be possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long_time and even for the whole duration of married life , if there be serious reason , such_as those often mention in the so-called medical , eugenic , economic and social `` indication '' . 
this mean that such factor as the health of the parent , particularly the mother , their ability to provide their child with the necessity of life , the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facility may legitimately be take into consideration in determine the number of offspring . 
these be substantially the same factor consider by non-catholic in family_planning . 
the law of many state permit birth_control only for medical reason . 
the roman_catholic_church , however , sanction a much more liberal policy on family_planning . 
catholic , protestant and jew be in_agreement over the objective of family_planning , but disagree over the method to be use . 
the roman_catholic_church sanction only abstention or the rhythm_method , also_known_as the use of the infertile or safe period . 
the roman_catholic_church consider this to be the method provide by nature and its divine author : it involve no frustration of nature 's law , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them . 
with the exception of the roman_catholic_church and the orthodox_catholic_church , most church make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptive , allow the couple free choice . 
here be a difference in theological belief where there seem little chance of agreement . 
the ground for the roman_catholic_church 's position be scriptural ( old_testament ) , the teaching of the father and doctor of the early roman_catholic_church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen century , the decision of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural_law . 
the latter play a prominent role in roman_catholic theology and is consider decisive , entirely apart from scripture , in determine the ethical character of birth_prevention method . 
the roman_catholic natural_law tradition regard as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act be procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouse be the secondary and subjective end . 
this conclusion is base on two proposition : that man by the use of his reason can ascertain god 's purpose in the universe and that god make known his purpose by certain `` given '' physical arrangement . 
thus , man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act be procreation , the propagation of the human_race . 
moreover , man may_not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangement establish by god , who through the law of rhythm has provide a natural method for the control of conception . 
believe that god be the author of this law and of all law_of_nature , roman_catholic believe that they be obliged to obey those law , not frustrate or mock them . 
let it be granted then that the theological difference in this area between protestant and roman_catholic appear to be irreconcilable . 
but people differ in their religious_belief on scores of doctrine , without take_up_arms against those who disagree with them . 
why be it so different in regard_to birth_control ? 
it be because each side has seek to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief , or at_least the practical consequence thereof , upon others . 
it be always a temptation for a religious organization , especially a powerful or dominant one , to impose through the clenched_fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others . 
both roman_catholic and protestant have succumb to this temptation in the past . 
consider what happen during world_war_1 , , when the protestant church unite to push the prohibition law through congress . 
many_of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree be intrinsically evil and sinful . 
with over four million american man away at war , protestant force their distinctive theological belief upon the general public . 
with the return of our soldier , it soon become apparent that the belief was not share by the great majority of citizen . 
the attempt to enforce that belief usher_in a reign of bootlegger , racketeer , hijacker and gangster that lead to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history . 
the so-called `` noble experiment '' come to an inglorious end . 
that tumultuous , painful and costly experience show clearly that a law express a moral judgment cannot be enforce when it have little correspondence with the general view of society . 
that experience hold a lesson for us all in regard_to birth_control today . 
up_to the turn_of_the_century , contraception was condemn by all christian_church as immoral , unnatural and contrary to divine_law . 
this was generally reflect in the civil_law of christian country . 
today , the roman_catholic_church and orthodox_church stand virtually alone in hold that conviction . 
the various lambeth_conferences , express the anglican viewpoint , mirror the gradual change that has take_place among protestant generally . 
in 1920 , the lambeth_conference repeat its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issue `` an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together_with the grave danger - physical , moral , and religious - thereby incur , and against the evil which the extension of such use threaten the human_race '' . 
denounce the view that the sexual_union be an end in itself , the conference declare : `` we steadfastly uphold what must always be regard_as the governing consideration of christian marriage . 
one be the primary purpose for which marriage exist , namely , the continuance of the human_race through the gift and heritage of child ; the other be the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control '' . 
the conference call_for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptive . 
in 1930 , the lambeth_conference again affirm the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of child , but concede that , in certain limited circumstance , contraception might be morally legitimate . 
in 1958 , the conference endorse birth_control as the responsibility lay by god on parent everywhere . 
many other protestant_denomination precede the anglican in such action . 
in march , 1931 , 22 out of 28 member of a committee of the group ratify artificial method of birth_control . 
`` as_to the necessity '' , the committee declare , `` for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of child , and consequently of control of conception , there can be no question . 
there be general_agreement also that sex union between husband and wife as an expression of mutual_affection without relation_to procreation be right '' . 
since then , many protestant_denomination have made separate pronouncement , in which they not_only approve birth_control , but declare it at_times to be a religious duty . 
what determine the morality , they state , be not the means use , but the motive . 
in_general , the means ( exclude abortion ) that prove most effective are consider the most ethical . 
this development is reflect in the action take in february , 1961 , by the general board of the group , the largest protestant organization in the us . 
the board approve and commend the use of birth_control device as a part of christian responsibility in family_planning . 
it call_for opposition to law and institutional practice restrict the information or availability of contraceptive . 
the general board declare : `` most_of the protestant church hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motive be right . 
the general protestant conviction be that motive , rather than method , form the primary moral issue , provided the method are limit to the prevention of conception '' . 
an action once universally condemn by all christian_church and forbid by the civil_law is now not_only approve by the overwhelming majority of protestant_denomination , but also deem , at certain time , to be a positive religious duty . 
this viewpoint has now been translate into action by the majority of people in this country . 
repeated poll have disclose that most married_couple are now use contraceptive in the practice of birth_control . 
for all concerned with social_welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habit of the vast majority of the american people be clear , profound and far reach . 
to try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasion by the ill-starred prohibition experiment . 
this bring us to the fact that the reality we are deal with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : they be moral judgment and matter of theological belief . 
conscience and religion be concerned with private sin : the civil_law be concerned with public crime . 
only confusion , failure and anarchy result when the effort is make to impose upon the civil_authority the impossible task of police private home to preclude the possibility of sin . 
among the chief victim of such an ill-conceived imposition would be religion itself . 
on april 17th , 1610 , the sturdy little three masted bark , discovery , weigh_anchor in location , london , and float down the location toward_the_sea . 
she carry , besides her captain , a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the arctic water of north_america . 
seventeen month later , on september 6th , 1611 , an irish fishing_boat sight the discovery limp eastward outside location . 
when she reach port , she was find to have onboard only eight men , all near starvation . 
the captain be gone , and the mate was gone . 
the man who now command her had start the voyage as an ordinary seaman . 
what disaster strike the discovery during those seventeen month ? 
what happen to the fourteen missing men ? 
these question have remain one of the great sea mystery of_all_time . 
for hundred of year , the evidence available consist_of ( 1 ) the captain 's fragmentary journal , ( 2 ) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivor , ( 3 ) a note find in a dead man 's desk onboard , and ( 4 ) several secondhand report . 
all_told , they offer a highly confused picture . 
but since 1927 , researcher dig_into ancient court record and legal file have be able to find illuminating piece of information . 
not enough to do away with all doubt , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the event of the voyage . 
historian have have two reason for persist so long in their investigation . 
first , they want to clarify a tantalizing , bizarre enigma . 
second , they believe it important to determine the fate of the captain - a man whose name is permanently stamp on our map , on american town and county , on a great american river , and on half a_million square_mile of arctic sea . 
the name : person . 
this be the story of his last tragic voyage , as_nearly_as we be able - or ever , probably , will be able - to determine : 
the sailing in the spring of 1610 be person 's fourth in four year . 
each time his objective had be the same - a direct water passage from western europe to the far_east . 
in 1607 and 1608 , the english group had send him northward to look_for a route over the north_pole or across the top of russia . 
twice he had fail , and the group indicate it would not back him again . 
in 1609 , the group hire person , give him two learned geographer , fit_out him out with a ship called the half_moon , and supply him with dutch sailor . 
this time he turn westward , to the middle_atlantic coast of north_america . 
his chief discovery be important - the location ( later , the hudson ) river - but it produce no northwest passage . 
when the half_moon put in at location , england , in the fall of 1609 , word of person 's finding leak_out , and english interest in him revive . 
the government forbid person to return to amsterdam with his ship . 
he thereupon go to london and spend the winter talk to man of wealth . 
by springtime , he was support by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of person , prince_of_wales . 
he had obtain and provision a veteran ship called the discovery and had recruit a crew of twenty-one , the large he had ever command . 
the purpose of this fourth voyage be clear . 
a century of exploration had establish that a great landmass , north and south america , lie between europe and the_indies . 
one_by_one , the opening in the coast that promise a passage through had been explore and discard . 
in_fact , person 's sail up the great_north_river had dispose of one of the last hope . 
but there remain one mysterious , unexplored gap , far to_the_north . 
nearly twenty-five year before , person had note , as he sail near the arctic_circle , `` a very great gulf , the water whirl and roar , as_it_were the meeting of tide '' . 
he name this opening , between baffin_island and labrador , the `` location '' . 
( later , it was to be call location . ) 
in 1602 , person , in the same little discovery that person now command , had sail 300 mile up the strait before his frightened men turn the ship back . 
person now propose to sail all_the_way through and test the sea beyond for the long sought waterway . 
even person , experienced in arctic sailing and determined as he be , must have have qualm as he slide down the location . 
ahead be perilous , ice filled water . 
on previous voyage , it had be in precisely such dangerous situation that he had fail as a leader and captain . 
on the second voyage , he had turn_back at the frozen island of location and meekly give the crew a certificate state that he did so of his own free_will - which be obviously not the case . 
on the third voyage , a near mutiny rise from a quarrel between dutch and english crew_member on the half_moon had almost force him to head the ship back to amsterdam in middle atlantic . 
worse , his present crew include five man who had sail with him before . 
of only one could he be sure - young person , his second son . 
the mate , person , who had keep the journal on the half_moon , be experienced - but he be a bitter old_man , ready to complain or desert at any opportunity . 
person , the ship 's carpenter , be a good worker , but perversely independent . 
person and person be like the rest - lukewarm , ready to swing against person in a crisis . 
but man willing to sail at_all into water where wooden ship could be crush like eggs be hard to find . 
person know he have to use these man as_long_as he remain an explorer . 
and he refuse to be anything else . 
it is believe that person be related to other seafaring man of the group and was train on company ship . 
he be a londoner , married , with three son . 
( the common misconception that he be dutch and that his first_name be person stem from dutch document of his third voyage . ) 
in 1610 , person be probably in his early forties , a good navigator , a stubborn voyager , but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession . 
person 's first error of the fourth voyage occur only a_few mile down the location . 
there at the river 's edge wait one person , whom person list as a `` clerk '' . 
person be in actuality a young ruffian from kent , who had break_with his parent in_order to keep_company the company he prefer - pimp , pander and whore . 
he be not the sort of sailor person want his backer to see onboard and he had person wait at location , where the discovery pick_up him up . 
for the first three week , the ship skirt up the east coast of great_britain , then turn westward . 
on may 11th , she reach iceland . 
poor wind and fog lock_up her up in a harbor the crew call `` location '' . 
the subsequent two_weeks wait make the crew quarrelsome . 
with person look_on , his protege person pick a fight with the ship 's surgeon , person . 
the issue was settle onshore , person win and person remain ashore , determined to catch the next fishing_boat back to england . 
with difficulty , person persuade him to rejoin the ship , and they sail from iceland . 
early in june , the discovery pass `` location '' ( southern greenland ) and in mid-june enter the `` location '' . 
floating ice bear_down from the north and west . 
fog hang over the route constantly . 
turbulent tide rise as_much_as fifty foot . 
the ship 's compass be useless because of the nearness of the magnetic north_pole . 
as the berg grow large , person was force to turn south into what be now location , an inlet of the great strait . 
after find that its coast lead nowhere , however , he turn north again , toward the main , ice filled passageway - and the crew , at_first uneasy , then frightened , rebel . 
the trouble be at_least partly person 's doing . 
for week he had been say that person 's idea of sail through to java be absurd . 
the great , crushing ice mass come into view make him sound like the voice of pure reason . 
a group of sailor announce to person that they would sail no far . 
instead of quell the dissension , as many captain of the era would have do ( person lop_off a man 's head off under similar circumstance ) , person decide to be reasonable . 
he go_to his cabin and emerge carry a large chart , which he set_up in_view of the crew . 
patiently , he explain what he know about their course and their objective . 
when person had finish , the `` town_meeting '' break_down into a general , wordy argument . 
one man remark that if he have a_hundred pound , he would give ninety of them to be back in england . 
up speak carpenter person , who say he would n't give ten pound to be home . 
the statement be effective . 
the meeting break_up . 
person be free to sail on . 
all through july the discovery pick her way along the 450 - mile long strait , avoid ice and rocky island . 
on august 3rd , two massive headland rear out of the mist - great gateway never before , so_far as person know , see by european . 
to starboard be a cape a_thousand foot high , patch with ice and snow , populate by thousand of screaming sea_bird . 
to port be a point 200 foot high rise behind to a precipice of 2000 foot . 
person name the cape person and person , for two of his backer . 
person point the discovery down the east coast of the newly discovered sea ( now called hudson_bay ) , confident he be on_the_way to the warm water of the pacific . 
after three week ' swift sailing , however , the ship enter an area of shallow marsh and river delta . 
the ship halt . 
the great `` sea to the westwards '' be a dead_end . 
this must have be person 's black discovery . 
for he seem to sense at_once that before him be no south_sea , but the solid bulk of the north-american continent . 
this was the bitter_end , and person seem to know he was destine to failure . 
feverishly , he try to brush away this intuition . 
north and south , east and west , back_and_forth he sail in the landlocked bay , plow furiously forward until land appear , then turn to repeat the process , day_after_day , week_after_week . 
hundred of mile to_the_north , the route back to england through the `` location '' was again fill with ice . 
the men be at_first puzzle , then anger by the aimless tack . 
once_more , person 's complaint be the loud . 
person 's reply be to accuse the mate of disloyalty . 
person demand that person prove his charge in an open trial . 
the trial was hold september tenth . 
person , preside , hear person 's defense , then call_for testimony from crew_member . 
person had make plentiful enemy , several man step_forward . 
hand on bible , seaman person and carpenter person swear that person had try to persuade them to keep musket and sword in their cabin . 
person say person had predict bloodshed on the ship . 
others add that person had want to turn the ship homeward . 
person depose person and cut his pay . 
the new mate be person , talented but inexperienced . 
there be other shift and pay_cut according to the way individual had conduct themselves . 
the important result , however , be that person and person , the deposed boatswain , become person 's sworn enemy . 
as person resume his desperate crisscross of the little bay , every incident lessen the crew 's respect for him . 
once , after the discovery lie for a week in rough weather , person order the anchor raise before the sea had calm . 
just as it was being haul inboard , a sea hit the ship . 
person and person were throw off the capstan and badly injure . 
the anchor cable would have be lost overboard , but person be on_hand to sever it with his axe . 
person , fifth earl of location , a noble humanitarian scot concerned with the plight of the crofter of his native location , conceive a plan to settle them in the valley of the red_river of the north . 
since the land he desire lie within the great northern empire of the group , he purchase great block of the group stock with the view to control its policy . 
having achieve this end , he be able to buy 116000 square_mile in the valley of the red and location river . 
the grant , which stretch southward to location - the headwaters of the red - was make in may , 1811 , and by october of that year a small group of scot was settle for the winter at location on hudson_bay . 
thus at the same time that person was prepare to pacify the aborigine of location and win fame at the battle of location , anglo-saxon settlement make a great leap into the center of the north-american continent to the west of the american agricultural frontier . 
seven hundred mile south of location , at `` the location '' of the red and the location , twenty-three man locate a settlement in august 1812 . 
by october the little colony about location ( present-day winnipeg ) number 100 . 
within a_few year the scot , engage in break the thick sod and stir the rich soil of the valley , were join by a group called person . 
the latter , member of two regiment of swiss mercenary transport by great_britain to canada to fight the american in the war_of_1812 , had settle in montreal and location at the close of the war in 1815 . 
person persuade eighty man and four officer to go_to red_river where they were to serve as a military_force to protect his settler from the hostile group which resent the intrusion of farmer into the fur trader ' empire . 
the mercenary be little interested in farming and add nothing to the output of the farm plot on which all work be still do with hoe as late as 1818 . 
it was the low yield of the person plot and the ravage of grasshopper in 1818 that lead to the dispersal of the settlement southward . 
when late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assess , all but fifty of the scot , swiss and metis move up the red to the mouth of the location river . 
here they build hut and a stockade named location after person barony in scotland . 
the new site be somewhat warm than location and much close to the great herd of buffalo on which the settlement must depend_on for food . 
the person settler had been anticipate in their move southward by british fur trader . 
for many year the group have its southern headquarters at location on the mississippi_river , some 300 mile southeast of present-day st._paul , minnesota . 
when in 1816 an act of congress force the foreign firm out of the united_states , its british born employee , now become american citizen - person , person and person - continue in the fur business . 
on location near the headwaters of the red_river , person , superintendent of the western group of canada , have a trading_post and plan in 1818 to build a fort to be defend by twenty man and two small artillery piece . 
his trading goods come from canada to the fork of red_river and from person settlement he bring them south in cart . 
these cart be of a type devise in location in the day of person the younger about a decade before the person colony was begin . 
in 1802 person refer to `` our new cart '' as be about four foot off the ground and carry five times as much_as a horse could pack . 
they were hold together by peg and withe and in later time draw by a single ox in thill . 
it was person who suggest to person that he return to the atlantic coast by way of the united_states . 
in september 1817 at location ( location ) person meet the noble lord whom , with the help of a band of sioux , he escort to location . 
during the trip person decide that the route through illinois territory to indiana and the eastern united_states be the best route for goods from england to reach red_river and that the united_states be a better source of supply for many goods than either canada or england . 
upon arrive_at baltimore , person on december 22 write to person , secretary_of_state at washington , inquire about law cover trade with `` location and location '' . 
this traffic , he declare prophetically , `` tho ' it might be of small account at_first , would increase with the progress of our settlement '' . 
the route which he had travel and which he believe might develop_into a trade_route was follow by his settler earlier than he might have expect . 
in 1819 grasshopper again destroy the crop at `` the fork '' ( location ) and in december 1819 , twenty man leave location for the most northerly american outpost at location . 
it be a three month journey in the dead of winter follow by three month of labor on mackinac boat . 
with these completed and ice gone from the location ( present-day minnesota river ) their 250 bushel of wheat , 100 bushel of oat and barley and 30 bushel of pea and some chicken were load onto the flat-bottomed boat and row up the river to location , across into location , and down the red . 
they reach location in june 1820 . 
this epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost person 1040 . 
nevertheless so short be the supply of seed that the settler were force to retreat to location for food . 
thereafter seed and food become more plentiful and the colony remain in the north the year round . 
activity by british trader and the presence of a colony on the red prompt the united_states war_department in 1819 to send person from detroit to put a post 300 mile northwest of location , until then the most advanced united_states post . 
in september 1822 two company of infantry arrive_at the mouth of the location , the head of navigation on the mississippi , and begin construction of location which , upon completion , was rename in_honor_of its commander , person . 
it was from the american outpost that red_river shortage of livestock were to be make good . 
person , fur trader and merchant at location , contract to supply person 's people with some 300 head of cattle , and person and person were hire as drover . 
person , after leave location in august 1821 , was force to leave some of the cattle at the group post on location `` in the location '' and reach location , as the person group center was now called , late in the fall . 
he set_out on his 700 - mile return journey with five family of discontented and disappoint swiss who turn their eye toward the united_states . 
observe their distressing condition , person allow these half starved immigrant to settle on the military reservation . 
as these swiss were move from the person settlement to become the first civilian resident of minnesota , person of location , michigan , and location was travel_to red_river to open a trade in merchandise . 
early in 1822 he be at location offer to bring_in pork , flour , liquor and tobacco . 
person , governor of location , and person , a chief factor of the group , order such `` sundry article '' to a value of 4500 . 
for its part the group was trouble by the approach of american settlement . 
as the time draw_near for the draw of the british american frontier by term of the agreement of 1818 , the company suspect that the group - its own post and group - be on american territory . 
accordingly person 's agent order the settler to move north , and by october , person had tear_down both post , float the timber to `` the location '' in raft . 
`` i have do everything '' , he write , `` to break_up the whole of that unfortunate establishment '' . 
despite group threat , duly carry_through , to cut_off supplies of powder , ball , and thread for fishing_net , about 350 person stay in the village . 
they would attempt to bring supplies from st._louis or location at `` great expense as well as danger '' . 
at location some of the_swiss also decide to cast their lot with the united_states , and in 1823 several family pay guide to take them to location . 
the disaster of 1825 - 1826 cause more to leave . 
after heavy rain and an onslaught of mouse , snow fall on october 15th , 1825 , and remain on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the red be five foot thick . 
in april come a rapid thaw that produce high water which did not recede until mid-june . 
on june 24th more than 400 family start the three month trip across the plain to the mississippi . 
by fall , 443 survivor of this arduous journey were cluster about location , but most_of them were send_on to location and st._louis , with a few go as far as location , indiana , a notable swiss center in the united_states . 
in 1837 , 157 red_river people with more than 200 cattle were live on the reservation at location . 
below the fort , high bluff extend uninterruptedly for six mile along the mississippi_river . 
at the point where they end , another settlement grow up around a chapel build at the boat landing by person in 1840 . 
its people , include person and other group employee and the refugee from location , were join by the remaining scot and swiss from location when person expel them from the reservation in may 1840 . 
the resultant town , plat in 1847 and name for the patron_saint of person 's mission , person , was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take_on a new interest for those selkirkers who remain at red_river . 
while population at location increase rapidly , from 2417 in 1831 to 4369 in 1840 , economic opportunity did not increase at a similar rate . 
accordingly , though the practice violate the no trade provision of the person charter which reserve all such activity in merchandise and fur to the group , some settler go into trade . 
the group maintain a store at which product of england could be purchase and bring_in goods for the new merchant on the understanding that they refrain_from trade in fur . 
despite this prohibition , by 1844 some of the location merchant were trade with the indian for fur . 
in june 1845 , the governor and council of location impose a 20 percent duty on import via location which were view_as aim at the `` very vitals of the group 's trade and power '' . 
to reduce further the flow of goods from england , the group 's local official ask that its london authorities refrain_from forwarding any more trade goods to these man . 
with their customary source of supply cut_off , the location free_trader engage three man to cart goods to them from the mississippi country . 
others carry pemmican from `` the location '' to st._paul and goods from st._paul to red_river , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , person , transport twenty barrel of whisky to the british settlement . 
this trade be subject to a tariff of 7.5 percent after february 1835 , but much was smuggle into location with the result that the duty was reduce by 1841 to 4 percent on the initiative of the london committee . 
the trade in a_few commodity note above was to grow in volume as a result of change both north and south of the 49 th parallel . 
the letter of the common_soldier be rich_in humor . 
indeed , no rich humor is to be find in the whole of american literature than in the letter of the semiliterate man who wear the blue and the gray . 
some of their figure_of_speech be colorful and expressive . 
a confederate observe that the yankee be : `` thick than louse on a hen and a dam site ornraier '' . 
another report that his comrade be `` in fine spirit pitch around like a blind dog in a meat_house '' . 
a third write that it was `` rain like pour pea on a rawhide '' . 
yank be equally adept at figurative expression . 
one write : `` [ i be so hungry ] i could eat a rider off his horse + snap_at the stirrup '' . 
a second report that the dilapidated house in virginia `` look_like the latter end of original_sin and hard_times '' . 
a third remark of slowness of southerner : `` they move about from corner to corner , as uneasy as a litter of hungry leech on the neck of a wooden god '' . 
still another , annoyed by the brevity of a recently receive missive , write : `` yore letter be short_and_sweet , jist like a roasted maggot '' . 
a yankee sergeant give the following description of his sweetheart : `` my girl be none of your one-horse girl . 
she be a regular stub_and_twister , double_geered . 
she be well-educated and refined , all wildcat and fur , and union from the muzzle to the crupper '' . 
humor find many mode of expression . 
a texan write to a male companion at home : `` what has become of person and person ? 
when you see them again give them my love - not best respects now , but love by god '' . 
person , an admirable georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserve in the group , like to tease his wife in his letter . 
after he had be away from home about a year he write : `` [ dear wife ] if i did not write and receive letter from you i believe that i would forget that i be married i do n't feel much like a married man but i never forget it sofar_as to court enny other lady but if i should you must forgive me as i be so forgetful '' . 
a yank , disturb by his increasing corpulence , write : `` i am grow so fat i be a burden 2 myself '' . 
another yank parody the familiar bedtime prayer : 
`` now i lie_down me down to sleep , the grayback o ' er my body creep ; if they should bite before i wake , i pray the lord their jaw to break '' `` . 
person , a splendid georgia soldier , differ from most_of his comrade in the rank in that he be the owner of a large plantation , well-educated , and nearly fifty year of_age . 
but he be very_much_like his associate in his hatred of camp routine . 
near the end of his service he write that when the war be over he was going to buy two pup , name one of them `` fall-in '' and the other `` close-up '' , and_then shoot them both , `` and that will be the end of ' fall-in ' and ' close-up '' ' . 
the soldier who comprise the rank_and_file of the civil_war army be an earthy people . 
they talk and write much about the elemental bodily_function of the body . 
one of the most common of camp malady be diarrhoea . 
man of more delicate sensibility refer to this condition as `` looseness_of_the_bowels '' ; but a much more common designation be `` the_shits '' . 
a michigan soldier station in georgia write in 1864 : `` i expect to be tough as a knot as_soon_as i get_over the georgia the_shits '' . 
johnny_reb from the deep_south who were plague with diarrhoea after transfer to the virginia front often inform their family that they were suffer from the `` the virginia quickstep '' . 
a georgia soldier give his wife the following description of the cause and consequence of diarrhoea : `` i have be a_little sick with diarrhea two or three day . 
i eat too_much eggs and pork it sour [ on ] my stomach and turn loose on me '' . 
a michigan soldier write his brother : `` i be well at_present with the exception i have get the diarrhea and i hope thease few line find you the same '' . 
the letter which pour forth from camp were usually write under adverse circumstance . 
save for brief period in garrison or winter quarters , soldier rarely enjoy the luxury of a writing_desk or table . 
most_of the letter were write in the hubbub of camp , on stump , piece of bark , drumhead , or the knee . 
in the south , after the first year of the war , paper and ink be very poor . 
scarcity of paper cause many southerner to adopt the practice of cross writing , i.e. , after write from left to right of the page in the usual manner , they give the sheet a half turn and write from end to end across the line previously written . 
sometimes soldier write letter while bullet were whiz about their head . 
a yank write from location , may twenty-eighth , 1863 , state `` not less_than 50 ball have pass_over me since i commence write . 
i could tell you of plenty narrow_escape , but we take no notice of them now '' . 
a reb station near location inform his mother : `` i need not tell you that i dodge pretty often , for you can see that very plainly by the blot in this letter . 
just count each blot a dodge and add in a_few for i do n't dodge every time '' . 
another reb write under similar circumstance before atlanta report : `` the yankee keep shoot so i be afraid they will knock_over my ink , so i will close '' . 
the most common type of letter be that of soldier husband to their wife . 
but father often address communication to their small child ; and these , full of homely advice , be among the most human and revealing of civil_war letter . 
reb who own slave occasionally would include in their letter admonition or greeting to member of the negro community . 
occasionally they would write to the slave . 
early in the war it be not uncommon for planter ' son to retain in camp negro `` body_servant '' to perform the menial chore such_as cooking , foraging , cleaning the quarters , shining shoe , and laundering clothes . 
sometimes these servant write or dictate for enclosure with the letter of their soldier master message to their relative and to member of their owner ' family . 
unmarried soldier carry_on correspondence with sweetheart at home . 
owing to the restrained usage characteristic of 19th century america , these letter usually be stereotyped and reveal little depth of feeling . 
occasionally gay young blade would write vividly to boon companion at home about their amorous exploit in richmond , location , washington , or nashville . 
but these comment be hardly printable . 
an alabama soldier whose feminine association be of the more admirable type write boastfully of his achievement among the virginia belle : `` they think i be a saint . 
i tell them some sweet lie and they believe it all . 
i would tell them i get a letter from home state that five of my negro had run_away and ten of papa but i wold say i reckon he did not mind it for he have a plenty more left and_then they would lean to me like a sore-eyed kitten to a basin of milk '' . 
some of the letter be pungently expressive . 
an ohio soldier who , from a comrade just return from leave , receive an unfavorable comment on the conduct of his sister , take pen in hand and delivered himself thus : `` [ dear sis ] person say he hear that you and person was a runing together all_the_time and he think he wod gust quit have any thing mor to doo with you for he think it be no_more use . 
i think you make a damn good choice to turn_off as nice a fellow as person and let that ornery thieving , drunkard , damned card-playing son_of_a_bitch come to see you , the goddamned thief and lop-eared pigeon-toed hellion , he be too ornery for hell . 
i will shoot him as_shore_as i see him '' . 
initiation into combat sometimes elicit from soldier correspondent choice comment about their experience and reaction . 
a federal infantryman write to his father shortly after his first skirmish in virginia : `` dear pa . 
go_out a scouting yesterday . 
we get to one house where there be five secessionist they break + run and person holler_out to shoot the ornery son_of_a_bitch and we all let_go at them . 
thay may say what they please but godamit pa it be fun '' . 
some of the choice remark make by soldier in their letter be in disparagement of unpopular officer . 
a mississippi soldier write : `` our person be a vain , stuck-up , illiterate ass '' . 
an alabamian write : `` person be [ an ignoramus ] fit for nothing higher than the cultivation of corn '' . 
a floridian state that his officer be `` not fit to tote_guts_to_a_bear '' . 
on december ninth , 1862 , person , an unusual louisianan who hold ab and ma degree from harvard_university and who before the war be headmaster of a private_school for boy in louisiana , write his wife : 
`` i see person and he be the most insignificant puke i ever see . 
his head cannot contain enough sense to command a regiment , much less a corps . 
person run first and his cavalry be well drilled to follow their leader . 
he be not worth shucks . 
but he be a group graduate and therefore must be born to command '' . 
similar comment about officer are to be find in the letter of northern soldier . 
a massachusetts soldier , who seem to have be a civil_war version of person , write : `` the officer consider themselves as make of a different material from the lowly fellow in the rank . 
they get all the glory and most_of the pay and do n't earn ten cent apiece on_the_average , the drunken rascal '' . 
private person of pennsylvania write : `` i be well convinced in my own mind that had it not been for officer this war would have end long ago '' . 
another yankee become so disgust as to state : `` i wish to god one-half of our officer were knock in the head by slinging them against [ the other half ] '' . 
no group of officer come_in_for more spirited denunciation than the doctor . 
one federal_soldier write : `` the doctor be no-account . 
hell will be fill with doctor and officer when this war be over '' . 
shortly after the beginning of person 's georgia campaign , an ailing yank write his homefolk : `` the surgeon insist on sending me to the hospital for treatment . 
i insist on take_the_field and prevail - think that i had_better die by rebel bullet than [ by ] union quackery '' . 
the attitude which the reb and yank take toward each other be very_much the same and range over the same gamut of feeling , from friendliness to extreme hatred . 
the reb be , to a massachusetts corporal , `` fighting madman or not man at_all but whiskey + gunpowder put into a human frame '' . 
a pennsylvania soldier write that `` they be the hard looking set of man that ever i see they look as if they had been feed on vinegar and shaving '' . 
private person of the group write in his diary : `` i stroll among the alabaman on the right , find some of the green specimen of humanity i think in the universe their ignorance be little less_than the slave they despise with as imperfect a dialect ' they reckon as how you ' uns all would be a heap worse to we ' uns all '' ' . 
in a similar vein , but write from the opposite side , person , a private in the 6th group , in a letter to his wife , state : `` you know that my heart be with you but i never could have be satisfied to have stay at home when my country is invade by a thieving foe by a set of cowardly skunk whose motto be booty . 
as part of the same arrangement , person had , in the spirit of peace and good_will , and in exchange for armed support in the april election campaign , bestow upon person a third share in the group proceeds and a cut in the person beer trade . 
the coalition was to prove inadvisable . 
person be a complex and frightening man , whose bright_blue eye stare with a kind_of frozen candour into others ' . 
he have a round , frank irish face , crease in a jovial grin that stay_in_place bleakly in_place even when he was pump bullet into someone 's body . 
he carry three gun - one in the right trouser pocket , one under his left armpit , one in the left outside coat pocket - and be equally lethal with both hand . 
he kill accurately , freely , and dispassionately . 
the police credit him with twenty-five murder but he was never bring to trial for one of them . 
like a fair number of bootlegger he dislike alcohol . 
he be an expert florist , tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquet and wreath . 
he have no apparent comprehension of morality ; he divide humanity into `` right guy '' and `` wrong guy '' , and the wrong ones he be always willing to kill and trample under . 
he have what was describe by a psychologist as a `` sunny brutality '' . 
he walk with a heavy list to the right , as that leg be four inch short than the other , but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his gun . 
person think him `` just a superior sort of plug-ugly '' but he be , in_fact , with his aggression and hostility , and nerveless indifference to risk or administer pain , a casebook psychopath . 
he be also at this time , although not so interweave in high politics and the racket as person and person , the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the chicago underworld , the roughneck king . 
person was bear in poverty , the son of an immigrant irish plasterer , in the location 's location , close by the sicilian quarter and location . 
he had be a choirboy at the group and also serve as an acolyte to person . 
the influence of mass be less pervasive than that of the congested , slum tenement among the bawdyhouse , honkytonk , and sawdust_saloon of his birthplace ; he run wild with the child gang of the neighbourhood , and go_through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving , police dodging , and housebreaking . 
at the age of ten , when he was work as a newsboy in the location , he was knock_down by a streetcar which result in his permanently shortened leg . 
because of this he be known_as person ( but , as with person and his nickname of person , never in his presence ) . 
in his teens person was enroll in the vicious location gang and he become a singing waiter in group , a notoriously low and rowdy dive in location , where befuddled customer were methodically loot of their money by the singing waiter before being throw_out . 
he then get a job with the group as a circulation_slugger , a rough fighter employ to see that his paper 's news pitch were not trespass upon by rival vendor . 
he was also at_the_same_time gain practical experience as a safebreaker and highwayman , and learn how to shoot to kill from a neanderthal convicted murderer name person , later commit to group as a homicidal maniac , but whose eye mist with tear when the young person sing a ballad about an irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor . 
person 's first conflict with the police come in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was commit to group for three month for burglary ; two year later he serve another three month for assault . 
those be his only interlude behind bar , although he collect four more charge on his police record in 1921 and 1922 , three for burglary and one for robbery . 
but by now person 's political pull was begin to be effective . 
on the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $ 10000 bond was furnish by an alderman , and the charge was nolle_prossed . 
on one of his 1921 venture he was actually come_upon by a person down on his knee with a tool embed in a labour office safe in the location ; the jury want better evidence than that and he was acquit , at a cost of $ 30000 in bribe , it was estimate . 
as promptly as person , person jump into bootlegging . 
he conduct it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous violence than the sicilian , but he have his huge location portion to exploit and he make a great_deal of money . 
unlike the sicilian , he additionally conduct holdup , robbery , and safe cracking expedition , and refuse to touch prostitution . 
he be also personally active in ward politics , and by 1924 person had acquire sufficient political might to be able to state : `` i always deliver my borough as per requirement '' . 
but whose requirement ? 
until 1924 person pistoleer and knuckle_duster bullyboy had keep his location domain solidly democratic . 
there was a question and answer gag that go_around at that time : q. `` who 'll carry the forty-second and forty-third ward '' ? 
a. `` person , in his pistol pocket '' . 
but as november 1924 draw close the democratic hierarchy was sorely trouble by grapevine report that person was being woo by the opposition , and was meet and confer with important republican . 
to forestall any change of allegiance , the democrat hastily organise a testimonial banquet for person , as public reward for his past service and as a reminder of where his loyalty lie . 
the reception was hold in a private dining_room of the location on location . 
it be an interesting fraternisation of ex convict , union racketeer , ward-heeler , sold-out official , and gunman . 
the guest list be in itself a little parable of the state of american civic life at this time . 
it include the top person men and person . 
when person hear of the banquet he summon person for an explanation of why he had been dishonour the police_department by consort with these felon and fixer . 
person say that he had understand the party was to be in honour of person , the proprietor of a location gambling_house . 
`` but when i arrive and recognize a number of notorious character i had throw into the detective bureau basement half_a_dozen time , i know i had been frame , and withdraw almost at_once '' . 
in_fact , person was honour during the ceremony with the presentation of a $ 2500 diamond stickpin . 
there was a brief interruption while one of person 's men jerk out both his gun and threaten to shoot a waiter who was pester him for a tip . 
then person was present with a platinum watch set with ruby and diamond . 
this dinner be the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gang and the politician , which , prior to 1924 , say person , `` had been maintain with more_or_less stealth '' , but which henceforth was mark by these ostentatious gathering , denounce by a clergyman as `` belshazzar feast '' , at which `` politician fraternize cheek_by_jowl with gangster , openly , in the big downtown hotel '' . 
person continue : `` they become an institution of the chicago scene and mark the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county government in 1928_-_29 '' . 
however , this inaugural feast do_good its sponsor no good whatever . 
person accept his platinum watch and the tribute to his loyalty , and proceed with the bigger and better republican deal . 
on election_day - november fourth - he energetically marshal his force of bludgeon man , briber , and expert in forge repeat vote . 
the result be a landslide for the republican candidate . 
this further demonstration of person 's ballooning power did not please person and person . 
in the past year there had be too many example of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement for their liking . 
he behave publicly with a cocky , swaggering truculence that offend their vulpine latin mind , and behave towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enrage them beneath their blandness . 
they were disturb by his idiotic bravado - as , when his bodyguard , person , complain that he had been snub by person , a prizefight referee , chieftain of a jewish gang and one of four brother of tough reputation , who be person , a gambler politician in loose beer run league with person and person , person , a policeman , and person , the young . 
to settle this slight , person go down to the group in the location , where , he had learn , person was attend the opening of a musical_comedy . 
at the end of the performance , person and person come_out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first-nighter . 
person draw his gun and fire at person , severely wound him in the stomach . 
a second bullet ricochet off person 's belt_buckle , leave him unhurt but in some distress . 
person tuck away his gun and walk out of the theatre ; he was neither prosecute nor even arrest . 
that sort of braggadocio , for that sort of reason , in the view of person and person , be a nonsense . 
a further example of the incompatible difference in personality be when two policeman hold_up a person beer convoy on a location street and demand $ 300 to let it through . 
one of the beer runner telephone person - on a line tap by the detective bureau - and report the situation . 
person 's reaction be : 
`` three_hundred dollar ! 
to them bum ? 
why , i can get them knock_off for half that_much '' . 
upon which the detective bureau despatch rifle squad to prevent trouble if person should send his gunman out to deal with the hijacking policeman . 
but in_the_meantime the beer runner , unhappy with this solution , telephone person and return to person with the message : `` say , person , i just been talk to person , and he say to let them cop have the three_hundred . 
he say he do n't want no trouble '' . 
but person and person have grave cause to hate and distrust the irishman . 
for three year , since the liquor territorial conference , person had , with his elastic patience , and because he know that retaliation could cause only violent warfare and disaster to business , tolerate person 's impudent double-crossing . 
they had suffer , in sulky silence , the sight of his sharp practice in location . 
when , as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunman in the april election , person had give person a slice of location , the profits from that district had be $ 20000 a month . 
in six month person had boost the profits to $ 100000 a month - mainly by bring_to_bear pressure to bear on fifty chicago speakeasy proprietor to shift out to the suburb . 
these booze customer had until then been buy their supplies from the person , person , and person gang , and now they were compete for trade with the person saloon ; once_again person 's brash recklessness had cause a proliferation of ill_will . 
the revenue from person 's location territory go_up still high , until the yield be more_than the person takings from the far bigger trade area of chicago 's location and location . 
but he still show no intention of share with the syndicate . 
at_last , even the controlled person be unable to hold still , and he tentatively suggest that person should take a percentage in the location brothel in_return for one from his location beer concession . 
person 's reply be a raucous laugh and a flat refusal . 
still more jealous bitterness was engender by the person gang 's seizure from a location marshalling_yard of a freight_car load of canadian whisky worth $ 100000 and by one of the big coup of the prohibition_era - the location warehouse robbery , which become famous for the cool brazenness of the operation . 
here was store $ 1000000 worth of bonded whisky . 
these 1750 case were cart_off in a one night operation by the person men , who leave in their stead the same number of barrel fill with water . 
a tsunami may be start by a sea_bottom slide , an earthquake or a volcanic_eruption . 
the most infamous of all was launch by the explosion of the island of location in 1883 ; it race across the pacific at 300 mile an hour , devastate the coast of java and sumatra with wave 100 to 130 foot high , and pound the shore as faraway as san_francisco . 
the ancient greek record several catastrophic inundation by huge wave . 
whether or not plato 's tale of the lost continent of location be true , skeptic concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient time . 
indeed , a tremendously destructive tsunami that arise in the arabian_sea in 1945 has even revive the interest of geologist and archaeologist in the biblical story of the flood . 
one of the most damaging tsunami on record follow the famous lisbon earthquake of november 1st , 1755 ; its wave persist for a week and were feel as faraway as the english coast . 
tsunami be rare , however , in the atlantic_ocean ; they be far more common in the pacific . 
japan has have 15 destructive ones ( eight of them disastrous ) since 1596 . 
the hawaiian_islands are strike severely an average of once every 25 year . 
in 1707 an earthquake in japan generate wave so huge that they pile into the location ; one wave swamp more than 1000 ship and boat in location . 
a tsunami in the hawaiian_islands in 1869 wash away an entire town ( location ) , leave only two forlorn tree stand where the community had be . 
in 1896 a japanese tsunami kill 27000 people and sweep_away 10000 home . 
the dimension of these wave dwarf all our usual standard_of_measurement . 
an ordinary sea wave be rarely more than a_few hundred foot long from crest to crest - no long than 320 foot in the atlantic or 1000 foot in the pacific . 
but a tsunami often extend more than 100 mile and sometimes as much as 600 mile from crest to crest . 
while a wind wave never travel at more than 60 miles_per_hour , the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be reckon in hundred of miles_per_hour . 
the great the depth of the water , the great be the speed of the wave ; person 's law say that its velocity be equal to the square_root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due_to gravity . 
in the deep water of the pacific these wave reach a speed of 500 miles_per_hour . 
tsunami be so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they be hardly detectable . 
their amplitude sometimes be as little as two foot from trough to crest . 
usually it be only_when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build_up to their terrifying height . 
on the fateful day in 1896 when the great wave approach japan , fisherman at_sea notice no unusual swell . 
not until they sail home at the end of the day , through a sea strewn with body and the wreckage of house , be they aware of what had happen . 
the seemingly quiet ocean had crash a wall of water from 10 to 100 foot high upon beach crowded with bather , drown thousand of them and flatten village along the shore . 
the giant wave be more dangerous on flat shore than on steep ones . 
they usually range from 20 to 60 foot in_height , but when they pour into a v shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportion . 
generally the first salvo of a tsunami be a rather sharp swell , not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observer . 
this is follow by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore as the first great trough arrive . 
reef are leave high-and-dry , and the beach are cover with stranded fish . 
at location large_number of people run out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach . 
many_of them pay for their curiosity with their life , for some minute later the first giant wave roar over the shore . 
after an earthquake in japan in 1793 people on the coast at location be so terrified by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurry to high ground . 
when a second quake come , they dash back to the beach , fear that they might be bury under landslide . 
just as they reach the shore , the first huge wave crash upon them . 
a tsunami be not a single wave but a series . 
the wave are separate by interval of 15_minutes to an hour or more ( because of their great length ) , and this has often lull people into think after the first great wave has crash that it be all_over . 
the wave may keep come for many hour . 
usually the third to the eighth wave in the series be the biggest . 
among the observer of the 1946 tsunami at location be person of the group , one of the world 's foremost marine geologist . 
he be able to make a detailed inspection of the wave . 
their onrush and retreat , he report , was accompany by a great hissing , roaring and rattling . 
the third and fourth wave seem to be the high . 
on some of the island ' beach the wave come_in gently ; they be steep on the shore face the direction of the seaquake from which the wave had come . 
in location they be from 21 to 26 foot high . 
the high wave , 55 foot , occur at location . 
scientist and fisherman have occasionally see strange by-product of the phenomenon . 
during a 1933 tsunami in japan the sea glow brilliantly at night . 
the luminosity of the water is now believe to have been cause by the stimulation of vast number of the luminescent organism noctiluca_miliaris by the turbulence of the sea . 
japanese fisherman have sometimes observe that sardine haul up in their net during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomach ; the fish have swallow vast number of bottom living diatom , raise to the surface by the disturbance . 
the wave of a 1923 tsunami in location bring to the surface and batter to death huge number of fish that normally live at a depth of 3000 foot . 
gratified fisherman haul them in by the thousand . 
the tsunami warning system develop since the 1946 disaster in hawaii rely_on mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devise by person of the group staff . 
it consist_of a series of pipe and a pressure measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface . 
ordinary water tide are disregard . 
but when wave with a period of between 10 and 40 minute begin to roll over the ocean , they set_in_motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which close an electric_circuit . 
this in_turn set_off an alarm , notify the observer at the station that a tsunami be in progress . 
such equipment has been install at location , location , location and location . 
the moment the alarm go_off , information is immediately forward to honolulu , which be the center of the warning system . 
this center also receive prompt report on earthquake from four group station in the pacific which are equip with seismograph . 
its staff makes a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alert tide station near the epicenter for a tsunami . 
by means of chart show wave travel time and depth in the ocean at various location , it be possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time_of_arrival at hawaii of a tsunami get underway at any spot in the pacific . 
the civil and military authority are then advise of the danger , and they issue warning and take all necessary protective step . 
all_of these activity are gear to a top priority communication_system , and practice test have been hold to assure that everything will work smoothly . 
since the 1946 disaster there have be 15 tsunami in the pacific , but only one be of any consequence . 
on november 4th , 1952 , an earthquake occur under the sea off the kamchatka_peninsula . 
at 17_:_07 that afternoon ( greenwich_time ) the shock was record by the seismograph alarm in honolulu . 
the warning system immediately go into action . 
within about an hour with the help of report from seismic station in alaska , arizona and california , the quake 's epicenter was place at 51 degree north latitude and 158 degree east longitude . 
while account of the progress of the tsunami come_in from various point in the pacific ( location report it was cover with nine foot of water ) , the hawaiian station made its calculation and notify the military_service and the police that the first big wave would arrive_at honolulu at 23_:_30 greenwich_time . 
it turn_out that the wave be not so high as in 1946 . 
they hurl a cement barge against a freighter in location , knock_down telephone_line , maroon automobile , flood lawn , kill six cows . 
but not a single human life was lose , and property damage in the hawaiian_islands did not exceed $ 800000 . 
there is little doubt that the warning system save life and reduce the damage . 
but it be plain that a warning system , however efficient , be not enough . 
in the vulnerable area of the pacific there should be restriction against build home on exposed coast , or at_least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or anchor strongly against wave . 
the key to the world of geology be change ; nothing remain the same . 
life has evolve from simple combination of molecule in the sea to complex combination in man . 
the land , too , is change , and earthquake be daily reminder of_this . 
earthquake result when movement in the earth twist rock until they break . 
sometimes this is accompany by visible shift of the ground surface ; often the shift cannot be see , but they be there ; and everywhere can be find scar of earlier break once deeply buried . 
today 's earthquake be most numerous in belt where the earth 's restlessness be presently concentrated , but scar of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not have them . 
the effect of earthquake on civilization have been widely publicize , even overemphasize . 
the role of an earthquake in start the destruction of whole city be tremendously frightening , but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular disaster . 
superstition has often blend with fact to color report . 
we have learn from earthquake much of_what we now know about the earth 's interior , for they send wave through the earth which emerge with information about the material through which they have travel . 
these wave have show that 1800 mile below the surface a liquid core begin , and that it , in_turn , have a solid inner core . 
earthquake originate as far as 400 mile below the surface , but they do not occur at greater depth . 
two unsolved mystery are base on these fact . 
( 1 ) as far down as 400 mile below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting force by sluggish flow rather than by break , as rigid surface rock do . 
( 2 ) if earthquake do occur at such depth , why not deeply ? 
knowledge gain from study earthquake wave has been apply in various field . 
in the search for oil and gas , we make similar wave under controlled condition with dynamite and learn from them where there be buried rock structure favorable to the accumulation of these resource . 
we have also develop technique for recognize and locate underground nuclear test through the wave in the ground which they generate . 
the following discussion of_this subject has been adapt from the book causes_of_catastrophe by person . 
at twelve minute after five on the morning of wednesday , april 18th , 1906 , san_francisco was shake by a severe earthquake . 
a sharp tremor was follow by a jerky roll . 
in ireland 's location , near the location , there be a quiet little suburb by the name of location , which mean `` garden of person '' . 
undoubtedly none of the resident realize the influence their town has have on american military history , or the deed of valor that have been do in its name . 
the battle_cry `` location '' ! 
burst from the lip of a charge cavalry trooper be the last sound hear on this earth by untold number of cheyenne , sioux and apache , mexican banditos under person , japanese in the location , and chinese and north_korean communist in korea . 
location be the battle_cry of the group , `` the group '' . 
today a battle_cry may seem an anachronism , for in the modern army , esprit_de_corps has been sacrifice to organizational chart and table . 
but do n't tell that to a veteran of the group , especially in a saloon on saturday night . 
of all the thousand of man who have serve in the 7_th_cav , perhaps no one know its spirit better than person . 
wiry and burr-headed , with steel_blue eye and a chest splattered with medal , person be the epitome of the old-time trooper . 
the truth be , however , that when person first report to the regiment the only steed he had ever ride be a swivel_chair and the only weapon he had ever wield be a pencil . 
person had been commission in the group and was serve as a personnel officer for the group when he decide that if he was going_to make the army his career , he want to be in the fighting part of it . 
though he know no more about military science and tactics than any other desk_officer , he manage to get transfer to the combat force . 
the next thing he know he was report for duty as commanding_officer of group , 7_th_cavalry , in_the_middle of corps maneuver in japan . 
outside of combat , he could n't have land in a tough spot . 
first_of_all , no unit like to have a new commanding_officer bring_in from the outside , especially when he be an armchair trooper . 
second , if there be ever a perfect time to pull_the_rug_out_from_under him , it be on maneuver . 
in combat , help your commanding_officer make a fool of himself might mean get yourself kill . 
but in maneuver , with the top brass watch him all_the_time , it be easy . 
person understand this and expect the worst . 
but his first few day with group be full of surprise , begin with person . 
person had expect a tough old trooper with a gravel voice . 
instead person be quiet , sharp and confident . 
he had enlist in the army straight out of high_school and had immediately set_about learn his new trade . 
there be no weapon person could not take_apart and reassemble blindfolded . 
he could lead a patrol and he know his paperwork . 
further , he had take_advantage full advantage of the army 's correspondence_course . 
he not_only know soldiering , but mathematics , history and literature as_well . 
but for all his erudite confidence , person be right out of the location mold . 
he be filled with the spirit of the group . 
that save person . 
person let the new commanding_officer know just how lucky he be to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the united_states army . 
he feed the captain bit of history about the troops and the regiment . 
for_example , it be a battalion of the group under person that had been wiped_out at the battle_of_the_little_big_horn . 
it did n't take person long to realize that he have to carry a heavy load of tradition on his shoulder as commander of group . 
but what make the load light be the realization that every officer , noncom and trooper be ready and willing to help him carry it , for the good of the troop and the regiment . 
maneuver over , the group return to garrison duty in tokyo , person still with them . 
it be the group whose trooper were charge with guard the location . 
but still person be not completely convinced that man would really die for a four syllable word , `` location '' . 
the final proof be a small incident . 
it happen at the st._patrick 's_day party , a big affair for a regiment which had go_into battle for over three quarter of a century to the strain of an irish march . 
in_the_middle of the party person look up to see four smiling face bear_down upon him , each beam above the big , green shamrock he had ever see . 
the face belong_to person , his wife and their two child . 
and when the singing begin , it be the person who sing the old irish song the best . 
though there be an occasional good-natured chuckle about person , the jewish officer from chicago , sing tearfully about the old sod , no_one really think it be strange . 
for person , like person , the bugler boy who carry person 's last message , or person , the one-man army on leyte , be a location , through and through . 
it be no coincidence that person be one of the most beloved platoon leader in the regiment . 
and so person get the spirit of location . 
he set_out to keep group the best troop in the best regiment . 
one of his innovation be to see_to_it that every man - cook and clerk as_well_as rifleman - qualify with every weapon in the troop . 
even the mess sergeant , person , a dapper , cocky transfer from an airborne division , go_out on the range . 
the troop receive a new leader , person , fresh out of rotc and buck for regular_army status . 
person be sharp and military , but he be up against tough competition for that group berth , and he want to play it cool . 
so person set_out to sell him on the spirit of location , just as he himself had been sell a short time before . 
when the korean_war begin , on june 25 , 1950 , the anniversary of the day person had go_down fight at the location and the day the regiment had assault the beachhead of leyte during world_war_2 , , the group be not in the best fighting condition . 
its entire complement of noncommissioned officer on the platoon level had depart as cadre for another unit , and its vehicle be still those used in the drive across location in world_war_2 , . 
just a month after the korean_war break_out , the group was move_into the line , ready for combat . 
from then on the group be in the thick of the bitter fighting in korea . 
one night on the location , person call_on that fabled esprit_de_corps . 
the regiment was dig_in on the east_side of the river and the north_korean were steadily build_up a concentration of crack troop on the other side . 
the trooper know an attack be coming , but they did n't know when , and they did n't know where . 
at 6_o_'_clock on the morning of august 12 , they be in doubt no_longer . 
then it come , against group . 
the enemy had filter across the river during the night and a full force of 1000 man , armed with russian machine_gun , attack the position hold by person 's man . 
they come in wave . 
first come the cannon_fodder , white clad civilian being drive into death as a massive human battering_ram . 
they were follow by crack north_korean troop , who mount one charge after another . 
they overrun the group 's forward machine_gun position through sheer weight of number , over pile of_their_own dead . 
another force flank the company and take_up a position on a hill to the rear . 
person see that it was build_up strength . 
he assemble a group of 25 man , composed of wounded trooper await evacuation , the company clerk , supply man , cook and driver , and lead them to the hill . 
one of the more seriously wounded be person , the young officer buck for the regular_army . 
person leave person at the bottom of the hill to direct any reinforcement he could find to the fight . 
then person start up the hill . 
he take one step , two , break_into a trot and_then into a run . 
the first thing he know the word `` location '' ! burst from his throat . 
his follower shout the old battle_cry after him and charge the hill , fire as they run . 
the korean fall_back , but regroup at the top of the hill and pin down the cavalryman with a screen of fire . 
person , look_to right and left to see how his man were fare , suddenly see another figure bound up the hill , hurl grenade and holler the battle_cry as he run . 
it be person , who had suddenly find himself imbued with the spirit of location . 
he had form his own task_force of three straggler and lead them up the hill in a person charge . 
because of this diversionary_attack the main group that had been pin down on the hill be able to surge forward again . 
but an enemy grenade hit person in the head and detonate simultaneously . 
he go_down like a wet rag and the attacker hit_the_dirt in the face of the withering enemy fire . 
enemy reinforcement come pour down , seek a soft_spot . 
they find it at the junction between group , and prepare to counterattack . 
person see what was happen . 
he turn_to his platoon . 
`` okay , man '' , he say . 
`` follow me '' . 
person leap to his foot and start forward , `` location '' ! on his lip , his man follow . 
but the bullet whack home before he finish his battle_cry and person fall dead . 
for an instant his man hesitate , unable to believe that their lieutenant , the most popular officer in the regiment , be dead . 
then they let_out a bellow of anguish and rage and , curse , scream and holler `` location '' ! they charge into the enemy like wild_man . 
that finish the job that person and person had begin . 
person 's platoon push_back the enemy soldier and break_up the timing of the entire enemy attack . 
reinforcement come_up quickly to take_advantage of the opening make by person 's platoon . 
the north_korean throw_away their gun and flee across the rice_paddy . 
artillery and air strike were call_in to kill them by the hundred . 
though person seem to have had his head practically blow_off by the explode grenade , he live . 
today he be a major - in the regular_army . 
so fill be person with the spirit of location that after korea be over , he take_on the job of write the complete history of the regiment . 
after year of digging , night and weekend , he put_together the big , profusely illustrated book , of_garryowen_and_glory , which be probably the most complete history of any military_unit . 
the battle of the location be just one example of how the battle_cry and the spirit of the group have pay_off . 
for nearly a century the battle_cry has never fail to rally the fighting man of the regiment . 
take the case of person , who survive the battle_of_the_little_big_horn in 1876 . 
from the enlisted_man he pistol-whip to the subordinate officer whose wife he try to rape , a lot of man have plenty of reason heartily to dislike person . 
many_of his fellow officer refuse to speak_to him . 
but when a board of inquiry was call to look_into the charge of cowardice make against him , the man who had see person leave the battlefield and the officer who had hear person suggest that the wounded be leave to be torture by the sioux , refuse to say a harsh word against him . 
he be a member of the group . 
although it be at the battle_of_the_little_horn , about which more word have been write than any other battle in american history , that the group first make its mark in history , the regiment be ten year old by then . 
person be the regiment 's first permanent commander and , like such general as person and person in their rise to military prominence , person be a believer in blood-and-guts warfare . 
during the civil_war , person , who achieve a brilliant record , was make brigadier_general at the age of 23 . 
he finish the war as a major-general , command a full division , and at 25 be the young major-general in the history of the u.s. army . 
i do not mean to suggest that these assumption be self-evident , in the sense that everyone agree with them . 
if they be , person would be write the same column as person , and person would have nothing to draw cartoon about . 
i do mean , however , that i take_for_granted them for granted , and that everything i shall be say would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumption . 
the ultimate objective of american policy be to help establish a world in which there be the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity ; and in_particular - since this be our special responsibility - that these condition be enjoy by the people of the united_states . 
i speak_of `` the large possible measure '' because any person who suppose that these condition can be universally and perfectly achieve - ever - reckon without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human_being , and be therefore a dangerous man to have around . 
these condition be unobtainable - be not even approachable in the qualified sense i have indicate - without the prior defeat of world communism . 
this be true for two reason : because communism be both doctrinally , and in_practice , antithetical to these condition ; and because communist have the will and , as long as soviet power remain intact , the capacity to prevent their realization . 
moreover , as communist power increase , the enjoyment of these condition throughout the world diminish pro_rata and the possibility of their restoration become increasingly remote . 
it follow that victory over communism be the dominant , proximate goal of american policy . 
proximate in the sense that there be more distant , more `` positive '' end we seek , to which victory over communism be but a means . 
but dominant in the sense that every other objective , no_matter how worthy intrinsically , must defer to it . 
peace be a worthy objective ; but if we must choose between peace and keep the communist out of berlin , then we must fight . 
freedom , in the sense of self-determination , be a worthy objective ; but if grant self-determination to the algerian person entail sweep that area into the location orbit , then algerian freedom must be postpone . 
justice be a worthy objective ; but if justice for bantus entail drive the government of the south_africa away from the west , then the bantus must be prepared to carry their identification card yet a while longer . 
prosperity be a worthy objective ; but if provide high standard_of_living get in the way of produce sufficient gun to resist communist aggression , then material sacrifice and denial will have to be make . 
it may be , of_course , that such objective can be pursue consistently with a policy design to overthrow communism ; my point be that where conflict arise they must always be resolve in_favor_of achieve the indispensable condition for a tolerant world - the absence of soviet communist power . 
this much having been say , the question remain whether we have the resource for the job we have to do - defeat communism - and , if so , how those resource ought to be use . 
this bring us squarely to the problem of power , and the use a nation make of power . 
i submit that this be the key problem of international relations , that it always has be , that it always will be . 
and i suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we be in has be the failure of american policy_maker , ever since we assume free_world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously . 
in the recent political_campaign two charge were level affect the question of power , and i think we might begin by try to put them into proper focus . 
one be demonstrably false ; the other , for_the_most_part , true . 
the first be that america had become - or was in_danger_of become - a second-rate military power . 
i know i do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention . 
you may have misgiving about certain aspect of our military establishment - i certainly do - but you know any comparison of overall american strength with overall soviet strength find the united_states not_only superior , but so superior both in present weapon and in the development of new ones that our advantage promise to be a permanent feature of u.s. - soviet relations for the foreseeable future . 
i have often search for a graphic way of impress our superiority on those americans who have doubt , and i think person has do it well in his new book american_might_and_soviet_myth . 
suppose , he say , that the turn_the_tables , and we be in the soviets ' position : `` there would be more_than 2000 modern soviet fighter , all better than ours , station at 250 base in mexico and the caribbean . 
overwhelming russian naval power would always be within a_few hundred mile of our coast . 
half of the population of the u.s. would be need to work_on arms just to feed the people '' . 
add this to the unrest in the country around us where oppressed people would be ready to turn_on us at the first opportunity . 
add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep_abreast of the soviets even in the missile field which is repute to be our main strength . 
if we look_at the situation this way , we can get an idea of person 's nightmarish worry - or , at_least , of the worry he might have if his enemy were dispose to exploit their advantage . 
the other charge be that america 's political position in the world has progressively deteriorate in recent years . 
the contention needs to be formulate with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign , but once that has been do , i fail to see how any serious student of world_affairs can quarrel with it . 
the argument was typically advance in_terms_of u.s. `` prestige '' . 
prestige , however , be only a minor part of the problem ; and even then , it be a concept that can be highly misleading . 
prestige be a measure of how other people think_of you , well or ill . 
but contrary to what was imply during the campaign , prestige be surely not important for its own sake . 
only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign people are not as impress by our strength as they ought to be . 
the thing to lose sleep over be what people , having conclude that we be weak than we are , be likely to do about it . 
the evidence suggest that foreign people believe the united_states be weak than the soviet_union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the year ahead . 
this ignorant estimate , i repeat , be not of any interest in itself ; but it become very important if foreign people react the way human_being typically do - namely , by take step to end_up on what appear to be the winning side . 
to the extent , then , that declining u.s. prestige mean that other nation will be tempt to place their bet on an ultimate american defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to soviet intimidation , there be reason for concern . 
still , these guess about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the soviet_union and ourselves . 
here i do not speak_of military power where our advantage be obvious and overwhelming but of political power - of influence , if you will - about which the relevant question be : 
be soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it be ten year ago ? 
and be western influence greater or less than it used to be ? 
in answer these question , we need to ask not merely whether communist troops have cross over into territory they did not occupy before , and not merely whether disciplined agent of the cominform be in control of government from which they were formerly exclude : 
the success of communism 's war against the west does not depend_on such spectacular and definitive conquest . 
success may mean merely the displacement of western influence . 
communist political warfare , we must remember , is wage insidiously and in deliberate stage . 
fearful of invite a military showdown with the west which they could not win , the communist seek to undermine western power where the nuclear might of the west be irrelevant - in backwoods guerrilla skirmish , in mob uprising in the street , in parliament , in clandestine meeting of undercover conspirator , at the united_nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conference - preferably at the high level . 
the soviets understand , moreover , that the first_step in turn a country toward communism be to turn it against the west . 
thus , typically , the first stage of a communist takeover be to `` neutralize '' a country . 
the second stage be to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist '' , while in_fact turn the country into an active advocate and adherent of soviet policy . 
and this may be as far as the process will go . 
the group 's goal be the isolation and capture , not of ghana , but of the united_states - and this purpose may be serve very well by country that masquerade under a `` neutralist '' mask , yet in_fact be dependable auxiliary of the soviet foreign_office . 
to recite the particular of recent soviet success be hardly reassuring . 
six year ago location , though in trouble , be in the western camp . 
today location be overtly communist ; laos is teeter between communism and pro communist neutralism ; cambodia be , for_all_practical_purposes , neutralist . 
indonesia , in the early_days of the republic , lean toward the west . 
today person 's government is heavily besiege by avowed communist , and for all_of its `` neutralist '' pretension , it be a firm ally of soviet policy . 
ceylon has move from a pro western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the west . 
in the middle_east , iraq , syria and egypt be , a short while ago , in the western camp . 
today the group and group government be adamantly hostile to the west , be dependent for their military power on soviet equipment and personnel ; in almost every particular follow the group 's foreign_policy line . 
a short time ago all africa be a western preserve . 
never_mind whether the kikiyus and the bantus enjoy wilsonian self-determination : the point be that in the struggle for the world that vast landmass be under the domination and influence of the west . 
today , africa is swerve violently away from the west and plunging , it would seem , into the soviet orbit . 
latin_america be once an area as `` safe '' for the west as nebraska be for person . 
today it be up_for_grabs . 
one latin-american country , cuba , has become a soviet bridgehead ninety mile off our coast . 
in some country the trend has go far than others : 
mexico , panama , and venezuela are display open sympathy for castroism , and there be no country - save the dominican_republic whose funeral service we recently arrange - where castroism and anti americanism does not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espouse the american cause . 
only in europe have our line remain_firm - and there only on the surface . 
the strain of neutralism are run strong , notably in england , and even in germany . 
what have we to show by_way_of counter success ? 
we have have opportunity - clear invitation to plant our influence on the other side of the iron_curtain . 
there be the hungarian revolution which we praise and mourn , but do nothing about . 
there be the polish revolution which we misunderstand and then help guide along a course favorable to soviet interest . 
there be the revolution in tibet which we pretend did not exist . 
only in one instance have we move purposely and effectively to dislodge existing communist power : 
in guatemala . 
and contrary to what has been say recently , we did not wait for `` outside pressure '' and `` world opinion '' to bring_down that communist government ; we move decisively to effect an anti communist coup . 
we serve our national interest , and by so doing we save the guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery . 
the first rattle of the machine_gun , at 7 : 10 in the evening , roused around me the varied voice and face of fear . 
`` sound exactly like last time '' . 
the young_man speak steadily enough , but all_at_once he look grotesquely unshaven . 
the middle-aged man say over_and_over , `` why did i come here , why did i come here '' . 
then he be sick . 
amid the crackle of small-arm and automatic weapon , i hear the thumping of mortar . 
then the light go_out . 
this be my second day in vientiane , the administrative capital of laos , and my thought be none too brave . 
where be my flashlight ? 
where should i go ? 
to my room ? 
better stay in the hotel lobby , where the wall look good and thick . 
chinese and indian merchant across the street were slam their steel shutter . 
hotel attendant pull parked bicycle into the lobby . 
a woman with a small boy slip in between them . 
`` please '' , she say , `` please '' . 
she hold_out her hand to show that she have money . 
the american newspaperman worry about get to the cable office . 
but what be the story ? 
had the communist led group finally come this far ? 
or be it another revolt inside vientiane ? 
`` let 's play hero '' , i say . 
`` let 's go to the roof and see '' . 
by 7 : 50 the answer be plain . 
there had be an eclipse of the moon . 
a traditional lao explanation be that the moon was being swallow by a toad , and the remedy be to make all possible noise , ideally with firearm . 
the din be successful , too , for just before the moon disappear , the frightened toad had begin to spit_out it out again , which mean good_luck all around . 
how quaint it all seem the next day . 
a restaurant post a reminder to patron `` who become excited and leave without pay their check '' . 
but everyone i meet had seek cover first and ask question later . 
and no wonder , for vientiane , the old city of location , had become the city of bullet_hole . 
i see hole in plane at the airport and in car in the street . 
along the main thoroughfare hardly_a house had not been pepper . 
in place of the police_headquarters be a new square fill with rubble . 
mortar had demolish the defense ministry and set fire to the american embassy next_door . 
what had be the ambassador 's suite be now jagged wall of blackened brick . 
this damage had been do in the battle of vientiane , fight less_than three month earlier when four successive government had rule here in three day ( december 9 - 11 , 1960 ) . 
and now , in march , all laos suffer a state of siege . 
the group force hold two northern province and openly take the offensive in three more . 
throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorist spread fear of ambush and death . 
`` and it be all the more tragic because it be so little deserved '' , say person , a belgian official of the group group . 
we talk after i hail his jeep mark with the group flag . 
practically all the people of laos , he explain - about two million of them - be rice farmer , and the means and motive of modern war be as strange to them as clock and steel plow . 
they look_after their field and child and water_buffalo in ten or eleven thousand village , with an average of 200 soul . 
nobody can tell more closely how many village there be . 
they spread over an area no larger than oregon ; yet they include people as different from one another as person be from person . 
`` what matter here be family loyalty ; faith in the_buddha and stay at peace with the phis , the spirit ; and to live in harmony with nature '' . 
harmony in laos ? 
`` precisely '' , say person . 
he speak_of the season of dryness and dust , bring by the monsoon from the northeast , in_harmony with the season of rain and mud , bring by the monsoon from the southwest . 
the slim pirogue in_harmony with the majestically meandering mekong_river . 
shy , slender-waisted girl at the loom in_harmony with the frangipani by the wayside . 
even life in_harmony with death . 
for so_long_as death be not violent , it be natural and to be welcome , make a funeral a feast . 
to many_a frenchman - they come 95 year ago , colonize , and stay until laos become independent in 1953 - the land had be even more delightfully tranquil than tahiti . 
yet laos be now one of the most explosive headache of statesman around the globe . 
the group , stiffen by communist veteran from neighboring north viet_nam , were supply by soviet aircraft . 
the group , on_the other hand , was pay and equip with american fund . 
in six year , u.s. aid had amount to more_than $ 1.60 for each american - a total of three hundred million dollar . 
we be there at a moment when the situation in laos threaten to ignite another war among the world 's giant . 
even if it did not , how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenade and submachine_gun ? 
to find_out , we travel throughout that part of laos still nominally control , in the daytime at_least , by the group : from location , the city of buffalo dung in the southeast , to location , the city of lion in the northwest , close to communist_china ( map , page 250 ) . 
we ride over road so rough that our jeep come to rest atop the soil between rut , all four wheel spin uselessly . 
we fly in rickety plane so overloaded that we wonder why they did n't crash . 
in_the_end we run_into communist artillery_fire . 
`` we '' be person of the group group , whose three camera and eight lens make him look as formidable as any fighting man we meet ; person , our interpreter ; and myself . 
person - the name mean one who have a boun , a celebration , and be therefore lucky - be born in location , the border of paradise . 
he had attend three university in the united_states . 
but he had never see the mountainous half of his native_land north of vientiane , include the royal capital , location . 
before the airplane come , he say , travel in laos be just_about impossible . 
alas , so it almost prove for us , too . 
to go outside the few city require permit . 
and get them seem a life 's work . 
nobody want american to be hurt or capture , and few soldier could be spare as escort . 
we were tell that to the group , a kidnaped american be worth at_least $ 750 , a fortune in laos . 
everyone had hear of the american contractor who had spurn an escort . 
now group propagandist were report march him barefoot from village to village , as evidence of evil american intervention . 
although we enjoy our round of the government_office in vientiane , with official offer tea and pleasing conversation in french , we were get nowhere . 
we had nearly decide that all the tale of lao lethargy must be true , when we were invite to take a trip with the prime_minister . 
could we be ready in 15_minutes ? 
his highness had decide only two hour ago to go_out of town , and he be eager to be off . 
and so , after a flight southeast to location , we find ourselves bounce along in a jeep right behind the landrover of person of location , a tall man of churchillian mien in a bush_jacket and a ten-gallon_hat from texas . 
from his shoulder_bag peeked the seven inch barrel of a luger . 
the temperature rise to 105 ` . 
with our company of soldier , we make one long column of reddish dust . 
in location , the city of silkworm , the prime_minister buy fried chicken and fried cicada , and two notebook for me . 
then we drive on , until there be no more road and we traverse dry rice field , bounce across their squat earth wall . 
it was a spleen crushing day . 
an hour of bouncing , a brief stop in a village to inspect a new school or dispensary . 
more bouncing , another stop , a new house for teacher , a new well . 
then off again , rush to keep_up . 
we be miserable . 
but our two jeep mate - person from location and person from location , pennsylvania - were beam under their coating of dust . 
together they had probably do more than any other man to help push laos toward the 20th th century - constructively . 
person , once a diplomat in paris and washington , be person . 
person , an engineer and anthropologist with a doctorate from the group , head the rural development division of group , the group administer u.s. aid . 
`` what you see be self-help project '' , person say . 
`` we ask the people what they want , and they supply the labor . 
we send shovel , cement , nail , and corrugated_iron for roof . 
that way they have an infirmary for $ 400 . 
we have 2500 such project , and they add_up to a_lot more_than just road and well and school . 
ask person '' . 
person agree . 
`` our people have been used_to accept thing as they find them '' , he say . 
`` where there was no road , they live without one . 
now they learn that man can change their surroundings , through their traditional village elder , without violence . 
that be a big step toward a modern state . 
you might say we be in the nation building business '' . 
in the village people line_up to give us flower . 
then come coconut , eggs , and rice wine . 
the prime_minister pay his respects to the buddhist monk , stride rapidly among the house , joke with the local soldiery , and make a speech . 
the soldier are fight and the american are help , he say , but in the fight against the group the key factor be the villager himself . 
then we be off again . 
we did it for three day . 
but our stumping tour of the south be n't all misery . 
cross the 4000 - foot width of the mekong at location , on a raft with an outboard_motor , we take_off our dusty shirt and enjoy a veritable ocean breeze . 
then we hang overboard in the water . 
briefly we roll over a paved road up_to location , on the cool location . 
the prince visit the hospital of operation brotherhood , support by the group of the philippines , and feed rice to two pet elephant he keep at his residence at location . 
in the village of location , which mean `` peaceful '' , we have a baci . 
this be the most endearing of lao ceremony . 
it take_place in the household , a rite of well-wishing for myriad occasion - for the traveler , a wedding , a newborn child , the sick , the new year , for any good purpose . 
the preparation be elaborate : flower , candle , incense stick , rice wine , dozens of delicacy , and piece of white cotton string . 
the string be draped around flower in tall silver bowl ( page 261 ) . 
the candle be lighted , and we sit on split bamboo mat among the village notable . 
i be careful to keep my foot , the seat of the least worthy spirit , from point at anyone 's head , where the worthy spirit reside . 
now a distinguished old_man call_on nine divinity to come and join us . 
next he address himself to our soul . 
a man have 32 soul , one for each part of the body . 
those soul like to wander off , and must be call back . 
with the divinity present and our soul in_place , we were wish health , happiness , and power . 
then , one_after_another , the villager tie the waiting cotton string around our wrist . 
these were to be keep on , to hold_in the 32 soul . 
as we step_out into the sunlight , a man come_up_to person and silently show him his hand . 
it have a festering hole as big as a silver_dollar . 
we could see maggot move . 
person say : `` i have some antiseptic salve with me , but it be too late for that '' . 
my interview with teenager confirm this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bond . 
jewish identity was often confuse with social and economic striving . 
`` be jewish give you tremendous drive '' , a boy remark . 
`` it mean that you have_to get_ahead '' . 
when i press for a purely religious definition , i encounter the familiar blend of liberal piety , interfaith good_will , and a small residue of ethnic loyalty . 
`` i like the tradition '' , a girl say . 
`` i like to follow the holiday when they come_along . 
but you do n't have_to worship in the traditional way . 
you can communicate in your own way . 
as i see it , there 's no real difference between be jewish , catholic , or protestant '' . 
another teenager remark : `` most jew do n't believe_in god , but they believe_in people - in help people '' . 
still another boy assert : `` to be a good jew be to do no wrong ; it be to be a good_person '' . 
when ask how this be different from be a good protestant , the boy answer , `` it be the same thing '' . 
this accord with the study by person and person . 
they discover that , although 42 percent of a sample of catholic student and 15 percent of the protestant believe it important to live in accordance with the teaching of their religion , only 8 percent of the jewish student have this conviction . 
the most important aim of the jewish student be as_follows : to make the world a better place to live in - 30 percent ; to get happiness for yourself - 28 percent ; and financial independence - 21 percent . 
nevertheless , most_of the teenager i interview believe_in maintain their jewish identity and even envision join a synagogue or temple . 
however , they be hostile to jewish orthodoxy , profess to believe_in judaism `` but in a moderate way '' . 
one boy say querulously about orthodox jew : `` it 's the twentieth century , and they do n't have_to wear beard '' . 
the reason offer for cling to the ancestral faith lack force and authority even in the teenager ' mind . 
`` we were bring_up that way '' be one statement which win general assent . 
`` i want to show respect for my parent ' religion '' be the way in_which a boy justify his inhabiting_a_halfway_house of judaism . 
still another suggest that he would join a temple `` for social reason , since i 'll be live in a suburb '' . 
intermarriage , which is generally regard_as a threat to jewish survival , was regard not with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild , clinical disapproval . 
most_of the teenager i interview reject it on pragmatic ground . 
`` when you marry , you want to have thing in common '' , a girl say , `` and it 's hard when you do n't marry someone with your own background '' . 
a fourteen year old girl from the middle_west observe wryly that , in her community , religion inconveniently interfere with religious activity - at_least with the peripheral activity that many middle-class jew now regard_as religious . 
it appear that an orthodox girl in the community disrupt plan for an outing sponsor by one of the jewish service group because she would not travel on saturday and , in_addition , require kosher food . 
another girl from a relatively large midwestern city describe herself as `` the only orthodox girl in town '' . 
this be , no_doubt , inaccurate , but it does convey how isolated she feel among the vast army of the nonobservant . 
one of the significant thing about jewish culture in the old teen years be that it be largely college oriented . 
sixty_five percent of the jewish teenager of college age attend institution of higher learning . 
this be substantially high than the figure for the american population at_large - 45.6 percent for male and 29.2 percent for female . 
this may help explain a phenomenon describe by a small_town jewish boy . 
in their first two year in high_school , jewish boy in this town make strenuous exertion to win position on the school team . 
however , in their junior and senior year , they generally forego their athletic pursuit , presumably in the interest of better academic achievement . 
it be significant , too , that the old teenager i interview believe , unlike the young ones , that jewish student tend to do better academically than their gentile counterpart . 
the percentage of jewish girl who attend college be almost as high as that of boy . 
the motivation for both sex , to_be_sure , be different . 
the vocational motive be the dominant one for boy , while jewish girl attend college for social reason and to become culturally developed . 
one of the significant development in american jewish life be that the cultural consumer be largely the woman . 
it be they who read - and make - jewish best_seller and then persuade their husband to read them . 
in upper teen jewish life , the non college group tend to have a sense of marginality . 
`` people automatically assume that i be in college '' , a nineteen year old machinist observe irritably . 
however , among the girl , there are some morale enhance compensation for not go_to college . 
the jewish working_girl almost invariably work in an office - in contradistinction to gentile factory_worker - and , buttressed by a respectable income , she be likely to dress better and live more expansively than the college_student . 
she be even prone to regard_as the college_girl as immature . 
one of the reason for the high percentage of jewish teenager in college be that a great many urban jew are enable to attend local college at modest cost . 
this be particularly true in large center of jewish population like new_york , chicago , and philadelphia . 
what be noteworthy about this large group of teenager be that , although their attitude hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterpart , they actually lead their life in a vast self-enclosed jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non jewish world . 
perhaps the jewish student at group - constitute 85 percent of those who attend the day session - can serve as a paradigm of the urban , lower-middle-class jewish student . 
there is , to begin , an important sex difference . 
typically , in a lower-middle-class jewish family , a son will be send to an out-of-town school , if financial resource warrant it , while the daughter will attend the local college . 
there are two reason for this . 
first , the girl 's education have a lower priority than the son 's . 
second , the attitude in jewish family be far more protective toward the daughter than toward the son . 
most jewish mother be determined to exercise vigilance over the social and sexual life of their daughter by keep them home . 
the consequence of this be that the girl at group outnumber the boy and do somewhat better academically . 
one can assume that some of the bright boy be out of town . 
group student have an ambivalent attitude toward their school . 
on_the_one_hand , there is a sense of not having move beyond the ambiance of their high_school . 
this be particularly acute for those who attend group directly across the street from group . 
they have a sense of marginality at being deny that special badge of status , the out-of-town school . 
at_the_same_time , there is a good_deal of self congratulation at attend a good college - they be even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtue - and they express pleasure at the cozy ingroup feeling that the college generate . 
`` it 's people of your own kind '' , a girl remark . 
`` you do n't have_to watch what you say . 
of_course , i would like to go_to an out-of-town school where there are all kind of people , but i would want lots of jewish kid there '' . 
for most group student , college be at_once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachment and a breaking_away from the cage of neighborhood and family . 
group be unequivocally jewish in tone , and effort to detribalize the college by bring_in unimpeachably midwestern type on the faculty have be unavailing . 
however , a growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitude impart by course in psychology and anthropology make the student increasingly critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parent . 
and the rebellion of these third generation jew be not the traditional conflict of culture but , rather , a protest against a culture that they view_as softly and insidiously enveloping . 
`` as_long_as i be home , i 'll never grow_up '' , a nineteen year old boy observe sadly . 
`` they do n't like it if i do anything away from home . 
it be so much trouble , i do n't usually bother '' . 
for girl , the overprotection be far more pervasive . 
parent will drive on friday night to pick_up their daughter after a sorority or house plan meeting . 
a freshman girl 's father not too long_ago call a dean at group and demand the `` low-down '' on a boy who was go_out with his daughter . 
the domestic tentacle even extend to the choice of a major field . 
under pressure from parent , the majority of group girl major in education since that coordinate best with marriage plan - limited graduate study requirement and convenient working hours . 
this mean that a great many academically talented girl are discourage from pursue graduate work of a more demanding nature . 
a kind of double_standard exist here for jewish boy and girl as it does in the realm of sex . 
the breaking_away from the prison_house of brooklyn be gradual . 
first , the student train on his hapless parent the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological and sociological insight . 
then , with the new affluence , there is actually a sallying_forth into the wide , wide world beyond the precinct of new_york . 
it be significant that the location , which used_to be the summer playground for old teenager , a kind of summer suburb of new_york , no_longer attract them in great number - except for those who work there as waiter , busboy , or counselor in the day_camp . 
the great world beyond beckon . 
but it should be point_out that some of the new watering_place - location , location , location , long_island , for_example - tend to be homogeneously jewish . 
although group does not_yet have a junior year abroad program , a good number of student spend summer in europe . 
in_general , however , the timetable of travel lag considerably behind that of the student at harvard or group . 
and acculturation into the world at_large be likely to occur for the group student after college rather_than during the four school_year . 
group be person territory , as much_as the_bronx or location . 
there are horde of nubile young_woman there who , prod by their impatient mother , be determined to marry . 
it be interesting that , although the percentage of married student be not appreciably high at group than elsewhere - about 30 percent of the woman and 25 percent of the man in the graduating_class - the anxiety of the unmarried has puff_up the estimate . 
`` almost everybody in the senior_class be married '' , student say dogmatically . 
and the school newspaper sell space to jubilant fraternity , sorority , and house ( in the group ) that have good news to impart . 
these announcement be , in_effect , advertisement for themselves as thriving marriage_mart . 
there are boxed proclamation in the newspaper of watching , pinning , ringing , engagement , and marriage in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity . 
`` group happily announce the engagement of person to person of group '' . 
the group student show some striking departure from prevailing collegiate model . 
the group enjoy no easy dominion here , and the boy be as likely to dress in rather foppish continental fashion , or even in nondescript working-class manner , as they be in the restrained , button-down group way . 
the girl be prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterpart out of town , and eyeshadow , mascara , and elaborate bouffant hairdo - despite the admonition of cautious guidance personnel - be not unknown even in early morning class . 
among the boy , there is very little bravado about drinking . 
group be distinctive for not have an official drinking place . 
the location encampment for drinking be foreign to most group boy . 
in a_few school district one find a link between school and job . 
in those vocational_program organize with group money , there may be a close tie between the labor_union and a local employer on_the_one_hand and the vocational teacher on the other . 
in these case a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program , save a year because of his vocational course in grade 11 and 12 . 
the apprentice program will involve further education on a part-time basis , usually at night , perhaps use some of the same equipment of the high_school . 
these opportunity are to be find in certain city in such_as craft as auto_mechanics , carpentry , drafting , electrical_work , tool-and-die_work , and sheet_metal work . 
formally organized vocational_program support by federal funds allow high_school student to gain experience in a field of work which be likely to lead to a full-time job on graduation . 
the `` diversified occupation '' program be a part-time trade preparatory program conduct over two school_year on a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business employer . 
the `` distributive education '' program operate in_a_similar_way , with arrangement between the school and employer in merchandising field . 
in both case the student attend school half-time and work in a regular job the other half . 
he receive remuneration for his work . 
in a_few place cooperative program between school and employer in clerical work have show the same possibility for allow the student , while still in school , to develop skill which be immediately marketable upon graduation . 
adult_education course , work-study_program of various sort - these be all evidence of a continuing interest of the school in further educational opportunity for out-of-school youth . 
in_general , however , it may be say that when a boy or a girl leave the high_school , the school authority play little or no part in the decision of what happen next . 
if the student drop_out of high_school , the break with the school be even more complete . 
when there be employment opportunity for youth , this arrangement - or lack of arrangement - work_out quite well . 
indeed , in some period of our history and in some neighborhood the job opportunity have be so good that undoubtedly a great many boy who be potential member of the profession quit school at an early age and went to work . 
statistically this has represent a loss to the nation , although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have be a wise one . 
i make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high_school and be highly successful in the business which he enter . 
he may or may_not be `` better_off '' than his classmate who go_on to a college and professional school . 
but in the next decade the nation needs_to educate for the profession all the potential professional talent . 
in a later chapter deal with the suburban school , i shall discuss the importance of arrange a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any high_school where he is find . 
in the negro neighborhood and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhood the problem may be one of identification and motivation . 
high motivation towards higher_education must start early enough so_that by the time the boy or girl reach grade 9 he or she has at_least develop those basic skill which be essential for academic work . 
undoubtedly far more can be do in the lower grade in this regard in the negro school . 
however , the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family be anti-intellectual . 
and the fact remain that there be today few shining example of negro in position of intellectual leadership . 
this be not due_to any policy of discrimination on_the_part_of the northern university . 
quite the contrary , as i can testify from personal experience as a former university president . 
rather we see here another vicious_circle . 
the absence of successful negro in the world of scholarship and science has tend to tamp_down enthusiasm among negro youth for academic career . 
i believe the situation is improve , but the success story need_to be heavily publicize . 
here again we run_into the roadblock that negro do not like to be designate as negro in the press . 
how can the vicious_circle be break ? 
this be a problem to which leader of opinion , both negro and white , should devote far more attention . 
it be at_least as important as the more dramatic attempt to break_down barrier of inequality in the south . 
i should_like to underline four point i made in my first report with respect_to vocational education . 
first_and_foremost , vocational course should not replace course which be essential part of the required academic_program for graduation . 
second , vocational course should be provide in grade 11 and 12 and not require more_than half the student 's time in those year ; however , for slow learner and prospective dropout these course ought_to begin earlier . 
third , the significance of the vocational course be that those enrolled be keenly interested in the work ; they realize the relevance of what they are learn to their future career , and this sense of purpose is carry_over to the academic course which they are study at_the_same_time . 
fourth , the type of vocational training_program should be related to the employment opportunity in the general locality . 
this last point be important because if high_school pupil be aware that few , if any , graduate who have choose a certain vocational_program have obtain a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappear . 
vocational training which hold no hope that the skill develop will be in_fact a marketable skill become just another school `` chore '' for those whose interest in their study has begin to falter . 
those who , because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employer to train their own employee , would limit vocational education to general rather_than specific skill ought_to bear_in_mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience . 
i have been use the word `` vocational '' as a layman would at_first_sight think it should be use . 
i intend to include under the term all the practical course open to boy and girl . 
these course develop skill other_than those we think_of when we use the adjective `` academic '' . 
practically all_of these practical skill be of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtain in high_school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at_once on the basis of the skill . 
they be in this sense skill marketable immediately on graduation from high_school . 
to_be_sure , in tool-and-die_work and in the building trade , the first job must be often on an apprentice basis , but two year of half-time vocational training enable the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status . 
similarly , a girl who graduate with a good working knowledge of stenography and the use of clerical machine and who be able to get a job at_once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community_college or secretarial_school . 
of_course , it can be argue that an ability to write english correctly and with some degree of elegance be a marketable skill . 
so , too , be the mathematical competence of a college graduate who has major in mathematics . 
in_a_sense almost all high_school and college course could be consider as vocational to the extent that later in life the student in his vocation ( which may be a profession ) will be call_upon to use some of the skill develop and the competence obtain . 
in_spite_of the shading of one type of course into another , i believe it be useful to talk_about vocational course as apart from academic course . 
perhaps a course in typewriting might be regard_as the exception which prove the rule . 
today many college bound student try to take a course in personal typing , as they feel a certain degree of mastery of this skill be almost essential for one who propose to do academic work in college and a professional school . 
most_of our largest city have one or more separate vocational or technical high_school . 
in this respect , public education in the large city differ from education in the smaller city and consolidated school district . 
the neighborhood high_school be not , strictly_speaking , comprehensive school , because some of the boy and girl may be attend a vocational or technical high_school instead of the local school . 
indeed , one school_superintendent in a large city object to the use of the term comprehensive high_school for the senior_high_school in his city , because these school do not offer strictly vocational_program . 
he prefer to designate such school as `` general '' high_school . 
the suburban high_school , it be worth note , also be not a widely comprehensive high_school because of the absence of vocational_program . 
the reason be that there be a lack of interest on the part of the community . 
therefore employment and education in all the school in a metropolitan area be related in different way from those which be characteristic of the comprehensive high_school describe in my first report . 
the separate vocational or technical high_school in the large city must be reckon as permanent institution . 
by_and_large their program be satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the reality of the apprentice system . 
it is not often realize to_what_degree certain trade be in many community closed area of employment , except for a lucky few . 
one has_to talk confidentially with some of the director of vocational high_school to realize that a boy cannot just say , `` i want to be a plumber '' , and then , by do good work , find a job . 
it be far more difficult in many community to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involve union approval than to get_into the most selective medical_school in the nation . 
two story will illustrate what i have_in_mind . 
one vocational instructor in a city vocational_school , speak of his course in a certain field , say he have no difficulty place all student in job outside of the city . 
in the city , he say , the waiting_list for those who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy have an inside_track he can n't get_in . 
in a far distant part of the united_states , i was talk to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade was do special work . 
`` what does he have_in_mind to do when he graduate '' ? 
`` oh , he 'll be a plumber '' , come the answer . 
`` but is n't it almost impossible to get_into the union '' ? 
i ask . 
`` he 'll have no difficulty '' , i was tell . 
`` he have very good connection '' . 
in my view , there should be a school which offer significant vocational_program for boy within easy reach of every family in a city . 
ideally these school should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical course be at the highest . 
an excellent example of a successful location of a new vocational high_school be the group in chicago . 
located in a bad slum_area now undergo redevelopment , this school and its program are especially tailor to the vocational aim of its student . 
hardly_a window has been break since group first was open ( and vandalism in school be a major problem in many slum_area ) . 
i discover in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupil be negro . 
they were learn trade as diverse as shoe_repairing , bricklaying , carpentry , cabinet making , auto_mechanics , and airplane_mechanics . 
the physical facility at group be impressive , but more impressive be the attitude of the pupil . 
in_general , religious interest seem to exist in all part of the metropolis ; congregational membership , however , be another thing . 
a congregation survive only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership ; that_is , when it can preserve economic integration . 
religious faith can be consider a necessary condition of membership in a congregation , since the decision to join a worshiping group require some motive force , but faith be not a sufficient condition for join ; the presence of other member of similar social and economic level be the sufficient condition . 
the breakdown of social homogeneity in inner_city area and the spread of inner_city blight account_for the decline of central_city church . 
central_city reveal two adverse feature for the major denomination : 
( 1 ) central_city tend to be area of residence for lower social_class ; ( 2 ) central_city tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition . 
the central_city area , in_other_words , exhibit the two characteristic which violate the life_principle of congregation of the major denomination : they have too few middle-class people ; they mix middle-class people with lower-class resident . 
central_city area have become progressively poor locale for the major denomination since the exodus of middle-class people from most central_city . 
with few exception , the major denomination are rapidly lose their hold on the central_city . 
the key to protestant development , therefore , be economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation . 
member of high and lower social_status often cluster around this nucleus , so_that protestant figure on social_class give the impression of spread over all social_class ; but this be deceptive , for the core of membership be concentrated in a single social and economic stratum . 
the congregation perish when it is no_longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood ; moreover , residential mobility be so high in metropolitan area that church have_to recruit constantly in their core stratum in_order to survive ; they can lose high - and lower status member from the church without collapse , but they need adequate recruit for the core stratum in_order to preserve economic integration . 
the congregation be first_and_foremost an economic peer_group ; it be secondarily a believe and worshiping fellowship . 
if it be primarily a believe fellowship , it would recruit believer from all social and economic rank , something which most congregation of the new protestantism ( with a_few notable exception ) have not be able to do . 
they survive only when they can recruit social and economic peer . 
the vulnerability of protestant congregation to social difference has often been attribute to the `` folksy spirit '' of protestant religious life ; in_fact , a contrast is often draw in this regard with the `` impersonal '' roman_catholic parish . 
we have see that the folksy spirit is confine to economic peer ; consequently , the vulnerability to social difference should not be attribute to the stress on personal community in protestant congregation ; actually , there be little evidence of such personal community in protestant congregation , as we shall see in another connection . 
the vulnerability of protestantism to social difference stem from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation be a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform_to , therefore , to the principle of economic integration . 
this fact be evident in the recruitment of new member . 
the rule of economic integration in congregational life can be see in the missionary outreach of the major denomination . 
there be much talk in theological circle about the `` church as mission '' and the `` church 's mission '' ; theologian have been stress the fact that the church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world . 
a crucial question , therefore , be what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan protestantism . 
if economic integration really shape congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extend economic integration . 
the task of a congregation would be define , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opt individual and family of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation . 
( co-optation mean to choose by joint action in_order to fill a vacancy ; it can also mean the assimilation of center of power from an environment in_order to strengthen an organization . ) 
in a mobile society , congregational health depend_on a constant process of recruitment ; this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather_than proclamation - like element will have_to be assimilate . 
evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully study in the church ; one study in pittsburgh , however , has illuminate the situation . 
in a sample of new member of pittsburgh church , almost 60 percent were recruit by initial `` contact with friendly member '' . 
if we add to these contact with friendly member the `` contact with an organization of the church '' ( 11.2 percent of the case ) , then a substantial two third of all recruitment be through friendly contact . 
on the surface , this seem a sound approach to christian mission : member of the congregation show by their friendly attitude that they care_for new people ; the new people respond in_kind by join the church . 
missionary outreach by friendly contact look somewhat different when one reflect on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhood ; the majority of such contact be with people of similar social and economic position ; association by level of achievement be the dominant principle of informal relations . 
this mean that the antenna of the congregation are extend into the community , pick_up the wavelength of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation ; the mission of the church be actually a process of informal co-optation ; the lay ministry be a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social_class nucleus of the congregation . 
church can be strengthen through this process of co-optation so_long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration ; once the pool of recruit diminish , the congregation be helpless - friendly contact no_longer keep it go . 
the transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicate by the insignificance of educational_activity , worship , preaching , and publicity in reach new member . 
the proclamation of the church is almost totally confine to pastoral contact by the clergy ( 17.3 percent of new member ) and friendly contact by member ( over two third if organizational activity are include ) . 
publicity account_for 1.1 percent of the initial contact with new member . 
in_general , friendly contact with a member follow by contact with a clergyman will account_for a major share of recruitment by the church , make it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation be the principal form of mission in the contemporary church ; economic integration and co-optation be the two method by which protestant associate with and recruit from the neighborhood . 
the inner life of congregation will prosper so_long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together ; the outer life of congregation - the suitability of the environment to their survival - will be propitious so_long as the people in the area be of the same social and economic level as the membership . 
economic integration cease when the social and economic status in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation . 
in a rapidly changing society congregation will run_into difficulty repeatedly , since such nice balance of economic integration be hard to sustain in the metropolis for more_than a single generation . 
the fact that metropolitan church of the major denomination have move approximately every generation for the last hundred year become somewhat more intelligible in the light of_this struggle to maintain economic balance . 
the expense of_this type of organization in religious life , when one recall the number of city church which deteriorate beyond repair before being abandon , raise fundamental question about the principle of protestant survival in a mobile society ; nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregation illumine the nature of the protestant development . 
it was observe in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trend - expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal grouping . 
these trend seem to be work at cross-purpose in the metropolis . 
residential association struggle to insulate themselves against intrusion . 
the motif of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential community have polarize ; the schism between central_city and suburb , negro and white , blue-collar and white-collar can be view_as symptomatic_of this deep polarization of trend in the metropolis . 
it now become evident that the denominational church is intimately involved_with the economy of middle-class culture , for it serve to crystallize the social_class identity of middle-class residential grouping . 
the accelerated pace of metropolitan change has accentuate the drive to conformity in congregation of the major denomination . 
this conformity represent a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment . 
more_than creature of metropolitan force , the church have take the lead in counteract the interdependence of metropolitan life , crystallize and perpetuate the stratification of people , give form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous people . 
since american life be committed above_all to productivity and a high standard of economic life , the countervailing force of residential and religious exclusiveness have fight a desperate , rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis . 
consumer community have suffer at_the_hands_of the productive interest . 
negro , puerto_rican , and rural newcomer are slowly make_one's_way their way into the city . 
soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburb , and the church will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterize their history for a century . 
the identification of the basic unit of religious organization - the parish or congregation - with a residential area be self-defeating in a modern metropolis , for it simply mean the closing of an iron_trap on the outreach of the christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation . 
mission to the metropolis contradict survival of the congregation in the residential community , because the middle_class are fight metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion . 
this interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projection for the church . 
it could be argue that any fellowship which center in residential neighborhood is doom to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle_class . 
it could be argue that only such neighborhood can sustain religious activity , since worship presuppose some local stability . 
whatever projection one makes , the striking fact about congregational and parochial life be the extent to_which it be a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people . 
attention will be give in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational church ; this style be characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle_class . 
the keynote of_this style be activism and emphasis on achievement in gain self-esteem . 
these values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman , dictate the method of child rearing , determine the pattern of community participation , set the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness , and inform the congregational life of the major denomination . 
`` fellowship by likeness '' and `` mission by friendly contact '' form the iron_cage of denominational religion . 
its content be another matter , for they reveal the kind of interest pursue by the congregation . 
what go_on in the cage will occupy our attention under the rubric of the organization church . 
an understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serve to illuminate the force which have fashion the iron_cage of conformity which imprison the church in their suburban captivity . 
the perplexing question still remain as to why the middle_class turn_to the church as a vehicle of social identity when their club and charity should fill the same need . 
nothing like person , he arrive before the hour . 
his letter had suggest we meet at my hotel at noon on sunday , and i come into the lobby as the clock strike twelve . 
he was wait . 
my wish to meet person had been prompt by simple curiosity and interest in his work . 
american newspaper reviewer like to call his play nihilistic . 
they find deep pessimism in them . 
even so astute a commentator as person of the group has say that `` waiting_for_godot '' be `` the concentrate of the contemporary european mood of despair '' . 
but to me person 's writing had seem permeated with love for human_being and with a kind of humor that i could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism . 
could it be that my own eye and ear had deceive me ? 
is his a literature of defeat , irrelevant to the social crisis we face ? 
or is it relevant because it teach us something useful to know about ourselves ? 
i know that a conversation with the author would not settle such question , because a man be not the same as his writing : in_the_last_analysis , the question had to be settle by the work itself . 
nevertheless i be curious . 
my curiosity was sharpen a day or two before the interview by a conversation i have with a well-informed teacher of literature , a jesuit father , at a conference on religious drama near paris . 
when person 's name come into the discussion , the priest grow loud and tell me that person `` hate life '' . 
that , i think , be at_least one thing i can find_out when we meet . 
person 's appearance be roughhewn irish . 
the feature of his face be distinct , but not fine . 
they look as if they had been sculpture with an unsharpened chisel . 
unruly hair go straight up from his forehead , stand so high that the top fall gently over , as if to show that it really be hair and not bristle . 
one might say it combine the man ; own pride and humility . 
for he have the pride that come of self_acceptance and the humility , perhaps of the same genesis , not to impose himself upon another . 
his light blue eye , set deep within the face , are actively and continually look . 
he seem , by some unconscious division of labor , to have give them that one function and no other , leave communication to the rest of the face . 
the mouth frequently break_into a disarming smile . 
the voice be light in timbre , with a rough edge that correspond to his visage . 
the irish accent is , as one would expect , combine with slight inflection from the french . 
his tweed suit be a baggy gray and green . 
he wear a brown knit sport_shirt with no tie . 
we walk down the location , thence along beside the location and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church . 
the conversation that ensue may have been engrossing but it could hardly be call world-shattering . 
for_one_thing , the world that person see be already shattered . 
his talk turn_to what he call `` the mess '' , or sometimes `` this buzzing confusion '' . 
i reconstruct his sentence from note make immediately after our conversation . 
what appear here be short than what he actually say but very close to his own words . 
`` the confusion be not my invention . 
we cannot listen to a conversation for five minute without be acutely aware of the confusion . 
it be all around us and our only chance now be to let it in . 
the only chance of renovation be to open our eye and see the mess . 
it be not a mess you can make sense of '' . 
i suggest that one must let it in because it be the truth , but person did not take_to the word truth . 
`` what be more true than anything else ? 
to swim be true , and to sink be true . 
one be not more true than the other . 
one cannot speak anymore of being , one must speak only of the mess . 
when person and person speak of a contrast between being and existence , they may be right , i do n't know , but their language be too philosophical for me . 
i be not a philosopher . 
one can only speak of what be in_front of him , and that now be simply the mess '' . 
then he begin to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form . 
until recently , art has withstand the pressure of chaotic thing . 
it has hold them at_bay . 
it realize that to admit them was to jeopardize form . 
`` how could the mess be admit , because it appear to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art hold itself to be '' ? 
but now we can keep_out it out no_longer , because we have come into a time when `` it invade our experience at every moment . 
it be there and it must be allow_in '' . 
i grant this might be so , but find the result to be even more attention to form than be the case previously . 
and why not ? 
how , i ask , could chaos be admit to chaos ? 
would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art ? 
if we look_at recent art we find it preoccupied with form . 
person 's own work be an example . 
play more highly formalized than `` waiting_for_godot '' , `` endgame '' , and `` krapp 's_last_tape '' would be hard to find . 
`` what i am say does not mean that there will henceforth be no form in art . 
it only mean that there will be new form , and that this form will be of such a type that it admit the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos be really something else . 
the form and the chaos remain separate . 
the latter is not reduce to the former . 
that is why the form itself become a preoccupation , because it exist as a problem separate from the material it accommodate . 
to find a form that accommodate the mess , that be the task of the artist now '' . 
yet , i respond , could not similar thing be say about the art of the past ? 
is it not characteristic of the greatest art that it confront us with something we cannot clarify , demand that the viewer respond to it in his own never predictable way ? 
what be the history of criticism but the history of man attempt to make sense of the manifold element in art that will not allow themselves to be reduce to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory ? 
is n't all art ambiguous ? 
`` not this '' , he say , and gesture toward the madeleine . 
the classical line of the church which person think_of as a temple of glory , dominate all the scene where we sit . 
the location , the location , and the location run to it with graceful flattery , bear tidings of the age_of_reason . 
`` not this . 
this be clear . 
this does not allow the mystery to invade us . 
with classical art , all be settled . 
but it be different at location . 
there be the unexplainable , and there art raise question that it does not attempt to answer '' . 
i ask about the battle between life and death in his play . 
person and person hover on the edge of suicide ; person 's world be death and person may or may_not get_out of it to join the living child outside . 
is this life_death question a part of the chaos ? 
`` yes . 
if life and death did not both present themselves to us , there would be no inscrutability . 
if there be only darkness , all would be clear . 
it is because there be not_only darkness but also light that our situation become inexplicable . 
take person 's doctrine of grace give and grace withhold : have you ponder the dramatic quality in this theology ? 
two thief are crucify with christ , one saved and the other damned . 
how can we make sense of this division ? 
in classical drama , such problem do not arise . 
the destiny of racine 's phedre is seal from the beginning : she will proceed into the dark . 
as she go , she herself will be illuminate . 
at the beginning of the play she have partial illumination and at the end she have complete illumination , but there has be no question but that she move toward the dark . 
that be the play . 
within this notion clarity be possible , but for us who be neither greek nor jansenist there be not such clarity . 
the question would also be remove if we believe in the contrary - total salvation . 
but where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable . 
the key word in my play be ' perhaps '' ' . 
give a theological lead , i ask what he think about those who find a religious significance to his play . 
`` well , really there be none at_all . 
i have no religious feeling . 
once i have a religious emotion . 
it be at my first communion . 
no_more . 
my mother be deeply religious . 
so be my brother . 
he kneel down at his bed as long as he could kneel . 
my father have none . 
the family be protestant , but for me it be only irksome and i let it go . 
my brother and mother get no value from their religion when they die . 
at the moment of crisis it have no_more depth than an old school tie . 
irish catholicism be not attractive , but it be deep . 
when you pass a church on an irish bus , all the hand flurry in the sign_of_the_cross . 
one day the dog of ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pig '' . 
but do the play deal with the same facet of experience religion must also deal with ? 
`` yes , for they deal with distress . 
some people object to this in my writing . 
at a party an english intellectual - so-called - ask me why i write always about distress . 
as if it be perverse to do so ! 
he want to know if my father had beat me or my mother had run_away from home to give me an unhappy childhood . 
i tell him no , that i had have a very happy childhood . 
then he think me more perverse than ever . 
i leave the party as soon as possible and get_into a taxi . 
on the glass partition between me and the driver be three sign : 
one ask for help for the blind , another help for orphan , and the third for relief for the war refugee . 
one does not have to look_for distress . 
it is scream at you even in the taxi of london '' . 
lunch be over , and we walk back to the hotel with the light and dark of paris scream at us . 
the personal quality of person be similar to quality i had find in the play . 
he say nothing that compress experience within a closed pattern . 
`` perhaps '' stand in_place of commitment . 
at_the_same_time , he be plainly sympathetic , clearly friendly . 
if there be only the mess , all would be clear ; but there be also compassion . 
as a christian , i know i do not stand where person stand , but i do see much of what he see . 
as a writer on the theater , i have pay_attention close attention to the play . 
person be right to say that `` waiting_for_godot '' be a reflection ( he call it a distorted reflection ) `` of the impasse and disarray of europe 's present politics , ethic , and common way_of_life '' . 
yet it is not only europe the play refer to . 
`` waiting_for_godot '' sell even better in america than in france . 
the consciousness it mirror may have come earlier to europe than to america , but it be the consciousness that most `` mature '' society arrive_at when their success in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examine the not strictly practical end of culture . 
america is now join europe in this `` mature '' phase of development . 
whether any of us remain in it long will depend_on what happen as a result of the technological and economic revolution now go_on in the country of asia and africa , and also of_course on how long the cold_war remain cold . 
there were fence in the old day when we be child . 
across the front of a yard and down the side , they be iron , either spiked along the top or arched in half circle . 
alley fence were make of solid board high than one 's head , but not so high as the golden_glow in a corner or the hollyhock that grow in a line against them . 
side fence be hidden beneath lilac and hundred_leaf rose ; front fence were cover with virginia_creeper or trumpet_vine or honeysuckle . 
square corner_post - and gatepost be an openwork pattern of cast_iron foliage ; they were top by steeple complete in every detail : high-pitched roof , pinnacle , and narrow gable . 
on these post the gate swing open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang . 
the only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fence be that obtain from an upper bough of the apple_tree . 
the primary quality of that view seem , now , to have be its quietness , but that cannot at the time have impress us . 
what one actually remember be its greenness . 
from high in the tree , the whole block lie within range of the eye , but the ground be almost nowhere visible . 
one look down on a sea of leaf , a breaking wave of flower . 
every path from back door to barn was cover by a grape_arbor , and every yard have its fruit_tree . 
in the center of any open space remaining our grandfather had plant syringa and sweet_shrub , snowball , rose_of_sharon and balm_of_gilead . 
from above one could only occasionally catch_a_glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea : a neighbor 's gingham skirt flash into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape_arbor , or the movement of hand above a clothesline and the flutter of garment hang there , halfway down the block . 
that be one epoch : the apple_tree epoch . 
another had end before it begin . 
time be a queer thing and memory a queer ; the trick that time plays_with memory and memory with time be queer of all . 
from maturity one look_back at the succession of year , count them and make them many , yet cannot feel length in the number , however large . 
in a stream that turn a millwheel there be a_lot of water ; the millpond be quiet , its surface dark and shadowed , and there does not seem to be much water in it . 
time in the sum be nothing . 
and yet - a year to a child be an eternity , and in the memory that phase of one 's being - a certain mental landscape - will seem to have endure without beginning and without end . 
the part of the mind that preserve date and event may remonstrate , `` it could have been like that for only a_little while '' ; but true memory does not count nor add : it hold fast to thing that be and they be outside of time . 
once , then - for how many year or how few does not matter - my world be bound round by fence , when i be too small to reach the apple_tree bough , to twist my knee over it and pull_up myself up . 
that world be in scale with my own smallness . 
i have no picture in my mind of the garden as_a_whole - that i could not see - but certain aspect of certain corner linger in the memory : windblown , frostbitten , white chrysanthemum beneath a window , with their brittle brown leaf and their sharp scent of november ; ripe pear lie in long grass , to be turn_over by a dusty slippered foot , cautiously , lest bee still work in the ragged , brown edged hole ; hot colored verbena in the corner between the dining_room wall and the side porch , where we pass on_the_way to the pump with the half gourd tie to it as a cup by my grandmother for our childish pleasure in drink from it . 
it be mother who plant the verbena . 
i think that my grandmother be not an impassioned gardener : 
she be too indulgent a lover of dog and grandchild . 
my great_grandmother , i have been tell , make her garden her great pride ; she cherish rare and delicate plant like oleander in tub and wallflower and lemon verbena in pot that have to be winter in the cellar ; she fill the waste spot of the yard with common thing like the garden_heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed , and the plantain_lily along the west_side of the house . 
these my grandmother leave in their place ( they be still there , more persistent and long-lived than the generation of man ) and plant others like them , that flourish without careful tending . 
three of these only were protect from us by stern commandment : the rose , whose petal may_not be collect until they had fall , to be make into perfume or rose tea to drink ; the peony , whose tight sticky bud would be blight by the laying_on of_a finger , although they were not apparently harm by the ant that crawl over them ; and the poppy . 
i have more_than once sit cross-legged in the grass through a long summer morning and watch without touch while a poppy bud high than my head slowly but visibly push off its cap , unfold , and shake out like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petal . 
other flower we might gather as we please : myrtle and white_violet from beneath the lilac ; the lilac themselves , that bloom so prodigally but for_the_most_part beyond our reach ; snowball ; hollyhock blossom that , turn upside-down , make pink petticoated lady ; and the little , dark_blue larkspur that scatter its seed everywhere . 
more potent a charm to bring back that time_of_life than this record of a_few picture and a_few remembered fact would be a catalogue of the minutia which be of the very stuff of the mind , intrinsic , because they were known in_the_beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that hold them . 
flower , stone , and small creature , living and dead . 
pale yellow snapdragon that by pinch could be make to bite ; seedpod of the balsam that snap like firecracker at a touch ; red and yellow columbine whose round tipped spur were pick_off and eat for the honey in them ; morning_glory bud which could be so grasp and squeeze that they burst like a blown-up paper_bag ; bright flower from the trumpet_vine that make `` gloves '' on the end of ten waggle finger . 
fuzzy caterpillar , snail with their sensitive horn , struggling grasshopper hold by their long hind_leg and command to `` spit tobacco , spit '' . 
dead fledgling bird , their squashed looking nakedness and the odor of decay that cling_to the hand when they had been bury in our graveyard in_front_of the purple flag . 
and the cast shell of a locust , straw colored and transparent , weigh nothing , fragile but entire , with eye like bubble and a gaping slit down its back . 
every morning early , in the summer , we search the trunk of the tree as high as we could reach for the locust shell , carefully detach their hooked claw from the bark where they hang , and stable them , a weird faery herd , in an angle between the high root of the tulip_tree , where no grass grow in the dense shade . 
we collect `` lucky stone '' - all the creamy translucent pebble , wear smooth and round , that we could find in the driveway . 
when these had been pocket , we could still spend a morning crack open other pebble for our delight in see how much pretty they be inside than their dull exterior indicate . 
we show them to each other and say `` would you have guess '' ? 
squat on our haunch beside the flat stone we break them on , we be safe behind the high closed gate at the end of the drive : safe from interruption and the observation and possible amusement of the passerby . 
thus shielded , we play many foolish game in comfortable unselfconsciousness ; even when the fence become a part of the game - when a vine embowered gatepost be the sleeping_beauty 's enchanted castle , or when person let_down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire , even then we pay little heed to those who go_by on the path outside . 
we enjoy a paradoxical freedom when we be still too young for school . 
in the heat of the summer , the garden solitude be ours alone ; our elder stay in the dark house or sit fan on the front_porch . 
they never trouble_oneself about us while we were play , because the fence form such a definite boundary and `` do n't go_out outside the gate '' be a command so impossible of misinterpretation . 
we be not , however , entirely unacquainted_with the varying aspect of the street . 
we be forbidden to swing on the gate , lest they sag on their hinge in a poor_white_trash way , but we could stand on them , when they be latched , rest our chin on the top , and stare and stare , commit to memory , quite unintentionally , all the detail that lie before our eye . 
the street that be full now of traffic and parked car then and for many year drowse on an august afternoon in the shade of the curbside tree , and silence be a weight , almost palpable , in the air . 
every slight sound that rise against that pressure fall_away again , crushed beneath it . 
a hay wagon move slowly along the gutter , the top of it sweep by the low bough of the maple tree , and loose straw were leave hang tangled among the leaf . 
a wheel squeak on a hub , be still , and squeak again . 
if a child watch its progress he whisper , `` hay , hay , load of hay - make a wish and turn_away '' , and then stare rigidly in the opposite direction until the sound of the horse ' foot return no_more . 
when the hay wagon had go , and an interval pass , a huckster 's cart might turn the corner . 
the horse walk , the rein be slack , the huckster ride with bowed shoulder , his forearm across his knee . 
sleepily , as if half reluctant to break the silence , he lift his voice : `` rhubarb nice fresh rhubarb today '' ! 
the lazy singsong be spaced in time like the drone of a bumblebee . 
no one seem to hear him , no one heed . 
the horse plod on , and he repeat his call . 
it become so monotonous as to seem a part of the quietness . 
after his passage , the street be empty again . 
the sun move slantwise across the sky and down ; the tree ' shadow circle from street to sidewalk , from sidewalk to lawn . 
at four o'clock , or four thirty , the coming of the newsboy mark the end of the day ; he toss a paper toward every front_door , and housewife come down to their steps to pick_up them up and read what their neighbor had been do . 
the street of any county town be like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer ; they be like this fifty odd year ago , and yesterday . 
but the fence be still in_place fifty odd years ago , and when we stand on the gate to look over , the sidewalk under our eye be not cement but two row of paving_stone with grass between and on both side . 
the curb be a line of stone lay edgewise in the dirt and tilt this way and that by frost in the ground or the root of tree . 
opposite every gate be a hitching_post or a stone carriage step , set with a rusty iron ring for tie a horse . 
the street be unpaved and rise steeply toward the center ; it be mud in wet weather and dust , ankle-deep , in dry , and could be cross only at the corner where there were stepping_stone . 
it have a bucolic atmosphere that it has lose long_since . 
the hoofmark of cattle and the footprint of bare foot in the mud or in the dust be as numerous as the trace of shod horse . 
cows were keep in backyard barn , boy were hire to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge of town , and familiar to the ear , morning and evening , be the boy ' coaxing voice , the thud of hoof , and the thwack of a stick on cowhide . 
the `` reality '' to which they respond be rationally empty and their art be an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and empty world . 
their artistic rationale be given to the witness of unreason . 
these polar concern ( imitation vs. formalism ) reflect a philosophical and religious situation which has been develop over a long period_of_time . 
the breakdown of classical structure of meaning in all realm of western culture has give_rise to several generation of artist who have document the disintegrative process . 
thus the image of man has suffer complete fragmentation in personal and spiritual quality , and complete objectification in subhuman and quasi mechanistic power . 
the image of the world tend to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or_else to dissolve into empty space and overwhelming mystery . 
the image of god has simply disappear . 
all such imitation of negative quality have give_rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism : if man can neither know nor love reality as it be , he can at_least invent an artistic `` reality '' which be its own world and which can speak_to man of purely personal and subjective quality capable of being know and worthy of being love . 
the person of the artist become a final bastion of meaning in a world render meaningless by the march of event and the decay of classical religious and philosophical system . 
whatever pole of this contrast one emphasize and whatever the tension between these two approach to understand the artistic imagination , it will be readily see that they be not mutually_exclusive , that they belong together . 
without the decay of a sense of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulate into being . 
and although these insight into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age require that they be take seriously and give promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapter in the philosophy of art may be write . 
for better or worse we cannot regard `` imitation '' in the art in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism . 
a broad concept of imitation be needed , one which acknowledge that true invention be important , that the artist 's creativity in part transcend the non artistic causal_factor out of which it arise . 
on_the_other_hand , we cannot regard artistic invention as pure , uncaused , and unrelated to the times in which it occur . 
we need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism . 
accordingly , it be the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation ( which i shall call mimesis in_order to distinguish it from earlier theory of imitation ) and a new theory of invention ( which i shall call symbol for reason to be state hereafter ) . 
the word `` mimesis '' ( `` imitation '' ) is usually associate with plato and aristotle . 
for plato , `` imitation '' be twice removed from reality , be a poor copy of physical appearance , which in itself be a poor copy of ideal essence . 
all artistic and mythological representation , therefore , be `` imitation of imitation '' and are completely supersede by the truth value of `` dialectic '' , the proper use of the inquiring intellect . 
in plato 's judgment , the art play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young , prior to the full development of their intellectual power . 
presuppose in plato 's system is a doctrine of level of insight , in which a certain kind of detached understanding be alone capable of penetrate to the most sublime wisdom . 
aristotle also tend to stratify all aspect of human nature and activity into level of excellence and , like plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level . 
the poetics , in affirm that all human art be `` mode of imitation '' , give a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did plato . 
but aristotle keep the principle of level and even augment it by describe in the poetics what kind of character and action must be imitate if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truth . 
for both plato and aristotle artistic mimesis , in_contrast_to the power of dialectic , be relatively incapable of express the character of fundamental reality . 
the central concern of person 's impressive volume called mimesis be to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of level of truth ) to a christian theory of imitation in which the level are dissolve . 
follow the theme of incarnation in the gospels , the christian artist and critic see in the most commonplace and ordinary event `` figure '' of divine power and reality . 
here artistic realism involve the audience in an impassioned participation in event whose overtone and implication be transcendent . 
artistic mimesis under christian influence record the involvement of all person , however humble , in a divine drama . 
the artist , unlike the philosopher , be not a removed observer aim at neutral and rarified high level of abstraction . 
he be the conveyor of a sacred reality by which he has been grasp . 
i have choose to use the word `` mimesis '' in its christian rather than its classic implication and to discover in the concrete form of both art and myth power of theological expression which , as in the christian mind , be the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience , which are not reserve , as in the greek mind , only to moment of theoretical reflection . 
in the first instance , `` mimesis '' is here use to mean the recall of experience in_terms_of vivid image rather than in_terms_of abstract idea or conventional designation . 
by `` image '' is mean not_only a visual presentation , but also remembered sensation of any of the five sense plus the feeling which are immediately conjoin therewith . 
this be the primary function of the imagination operate in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the image were first appropriate . 
mimesis be the near possible thing to the actual reliving of experience , in which the imagine person recover through image something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself . 
the image themselves , like their counterpart in experience , be not neutral quality to be survey dispassionately ; they be fields_of_force exert a unique influence on the sensibility and a unique relatedness to one_another . 
they bring an inextricable component of value within themselves , with attraction and repulsion native to their own quality . 
as in experience one is seize by given entity and their interrelation and is force to respond in value feeling to them , so one is similarly seize in the mimetic presentation of image . 
mimesis here is not to be confuse with literalism or realism in the conventional sense . 
a word taken in its dictionary meaning , a photographic image of a recognizable object , the mere picturing of a `` scene '' tend to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstraction as to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feeling . 
similarly experience itself can be conventionalize so that people react to certain preconceived clue for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field . 
a truly vivid imagination move beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy . 
the mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tend to express itself in the presentation of artistic form and material . 
when word can be use in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sight and sound , when tone of sound and color of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibility with an undeniable force of datum in and of themselves , compel the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitate the way experience itself in its deep character strike upon the door of consciousness and clamor for entrance . 
these be like the initial way in which the world force itself upon the self and thrust the self into decision and choice . 
the presence of genuine mimesis in art is mark by the persistence with which the work demand attention and compel valuation even_though it is but vaguely understand . 
underlie these conception of mimesis are certain presupposition concern the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed . 
experience is not see , as it is in classical rationalism , as present us initially with clear and distinct object simply located in space and register their character , movement , and change on the tabula_rasa of an uninvolved intellect . 
neither is primary experience understand according_to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing is think to be receive other_than signal of sensory quality produce their response in the appropriate sense_organ . 
primary feeling of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known object ( house , tree , implement , etc . ) nor a collection of isolated and neutral sensory quality . 
in_contrast_to all this , primary datum be datum of a self involved in environ process and power . 
the most primitive feeling be rudimentary value feeling , both positive and negative : a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself ; a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part . 
these desire presuppose a sense of causally efficacious power in which one be involved , some work for one 's good , others threaten ill . 
gone be the tabula_rasa of the mind . 
in its place be a passionate consciousness grasp and mold to feeling of positive or negative value even as the action of one 's life are determine by constellation of process in which one is catch . 
the principal defender of this view of primary experience as `` causal efficacy '' be person . 
our most elemental and unavoidable impression , he say , be those of be involved in a large arena of power which have a long past than our own , which be interrelated in a vast movement through the present toward the future . 
we feel the quality of these power initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening . 
later abstractive and rational process may indicate error of judgment in these apprehension of value , but the apprehension themselves be the primary stuff of experience . 
it take a great_deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unity of power and influence and to view one 's world simply as a collection of sense_datum arranged in such-and-such sequence and pattern , devoid_of all power to move the feeling and action except in_so_far as they present themselves for inspection . 
person is here question person 's understanding of the nature of experience ; he is question , also , every epistemology which stem from person 's presupposition that experience be merely sense_datum in abstraction from causal efficacy , and that causal efficacy be something intellectually impute to the world , not directly perceive . 
what person call `` sensation '' be what person call `` perception in the mode of presentational immediacy '' which be a sophisticated abstraction from perception in the mode of causal efficacy . 
as_long_as perception is see as composed only of isolated sense_datum , most_of the quality and interconnectedness of existence lose its objectivity , become an invention of consciousness , and the result be a philosophical scepticism . 
person contend that the human way of understand existence as a unity of interlocking and interdependent process which constitute each_other and which cause each_other to be and not to be be possible only because the basic form of such an understanding , for all its vagueness and tendency to mistake the detail , is initially give in the way man feel the world . 
in this respect experience be broad and full of a rich variety of potential meaning than the mind of man or any of his art or culture be capable of make clear and distinct . 
a chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy be one of derivation from the past . 
both i and my feeling come_up out of a chain of event that fan_out into the past into source that be ultimately very unlike the entity which i now be . 
after only eighteen year of noninterference , there were already indication of melioration , though `` in a slight degree '' , to_be_sure . 
there were more indication by the mid twentieth century . 
i leave it to the statistician to say what they be , but i notice several a_few year ago , during an automobile ride from memphis to location . 
in town after town my companion point_out the negro school and the white school , and in every instance the former make a better appearance ( it be new , for_one_thing ) . 
it really look as if a change of the sort predict by person had been go_on . 
but with the renewal of interference in 1954 ( as with its beginning in 1835 ) , the improvement was impair . 
for over a_hundred year southerner have feel that the north was pick on them . 
it be infuriating , this feeling that one is being pick on , continually , constantly . 
by what right of superior virtue , southerner ask , do the people of the north do this ? 
the traditional strategy of the south has been to expose the vice of the north , to demonstrate that the north possess no superior virtue , to `` show the world that '' ( as person 's person say to his adversary ) `` however bad i may be , you be not quite the people to say it '' . 
in the pre civil_war year , the south argue that the slave was not less humanely treat than the factory_worker of the north . 
at the present_time , the counterattack take the line that there 's no more of the true spirit of `` integration '' in the north than in the south . 
the line be a pretty good one . 
people talk_about `` the law of the land '' . 
the expression has become quite a cliche . 
but people can n't be make to integrate , socialize ( the two be inseparable by southern standard ) by law . 
i was have lunch not_long ago ( apology to person ) with three distinguished historian ( one specialize in the european middle_ages , one in american history , and one in the far_east ) , and i ask them if they could name instance where the general mores had been radically change with `` deliberate speed , majestic instancy '' ( person 's words for the hound_of_heaven 's pursuit ) by judicial fiat . 
they did n't seem to be able to think_of any . 
a virginia judge a while back cite a roman jurist to the effect that ten year might be a reasonable length of time for such a change . 
but i suspect that the old roman was refer to change make under military occupation - the sort of change which person was talk_about when he say , `` they make a desert , and call it peace '' ( `` solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant '' . ) 
. 
moreover , the law of the land be not irrevocable ; it can be change ; it has been , many time . 
person 's person decision in 1857 be unpopular in the north , and soon become a dead_letter . 
prohibition be the law of the land , but it be unpopular ( how many of us oldster take_up drinking in prohibition day , drinking be so gay , so fashionable , especially in the sophisticated northeast ! ) 
and was repeal . 
the cliche lose its talismanic virtue in the light of a_little history . 
the declaration_of_independence say that `` government derive their just power from the consent of the governed '' . 
the phrase `` consent of the governed '' need a hard look . 
how do we define it ? 
be the consent of the governed a numerical majority ? 
person deal with this question in his `` disquisition_on_government '' . 
to guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority , person develop his theory of `` concurrent majority '' , which , he say , `` by give to each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the action of government , a negative on the others , prevent all partial or local legislation '' . 
who will say that our country be even now a homogeneous community ? 
that regional peculiarity do not still exist ? 
that the court_order does not unequally affect the southern region ? 
who will deny that in a vast portion of the south the federal action be incompatible with the jeffersonian concept of `` the consent of the governed '' ? 
circumstance alter case . 
a friend of mine in new_mexico say the court_order had cause no particular trouble out there , that all had go as merry as a marriage bell . 
he seem a_little surprised that it should have cause any particular trouble anywhere . 
i murmur something about a possible difference between new_mexico 's history and mississippi 's . 
one can meet_with aloofness almost anywhere : the thank-heaven-we 're_-_not-involved viewpoint , it does n't affect us ! 
southern liberal ( there be many ) - especially if they be rich - often exhibit blithe insouciance . 
the trouble here be that it be almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it does n't cost you anything . 
you 've already send your daughter to person 's select academy for girl and your son to person 's select academy for boy , and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity . 
if there 's no suitable academy in your own neighborhood , there 's always new_england . 
new_england academy welcome fugitive from the province , south as_well_as west . 
they may even enroll a colored student or two for show , though he usually turn_out to be from thailand , or any place other_than the american south . 
it would be interesting to know how much `` integration '' there is in the famous , fashionable college and prep_school of new_england . 
a recent newspaper report say there were five negro in the 1960 graduating_class of nearly one_thousand at yale ; that_is , about one-half of one percent , which look pretty `` tokenish '' to me , especially in an institution which profess to be `` national '' . 
i must confess that i prefer the liberal who be personally affected , who be willing to send his own child to a mixed school as proof of his faith . 
i leave_out of account the question of the best interest of the child , the question of what their best interest really be . 
i 'm talk_about the grand manner of the liberal - north and south - who be not affected personally . 
if these people were deny a voice ( do they have a moral right to a voice ? ) 
, what voice would be left ? 
who be involved willy-nilly ? 
well , after everybody has follow the new_england pattern of segregate one 's child into private_school , only the poor folk be left . 
and it be precisely in this poor economic class that one find , and has always find , the most racial friction . 
a dear , respected friend of mine , who like myself grow_up in the south and has spend many year in new_england , say to me not_long ago : `` i can n't forgive new_england for reject all complicity '' . 
be a teacher of american literature , i remember person 's `` massachusetts_to_virginia '' , where he say : `` but that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone , and reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sow '' . 
there is a legend ( person record it in his `` english_notebooks '' . 
and one find it again in thomas_nelson_page ) to the effect that the mayflower on its second voyage bring a cargo of negro slave . 
whether historically a fact or not , the legend have a certain symbolic value . 
complicity be an embarrassing word . 
it be something which most_of us try to get_out from under . 
like the cowboy in person 's `` blue_hotel '' , we run around cry , `` well , i did n't do anything , did i '' ? 
person put it this way in `` brother_to_dragons '' : 
`` the recognition of complicity be the beginning of innocence '' , where innocence , i think , mean about the same thing as redemption . 
a man must be able to say , `` father , i have sin '' , or there is no hope for him . 
person understand this better than most when he say in his `` second inaugural '' that god `` give to both north and south this terrible war , as the woe due to those by whom the offense come '' . 
he also speak_of `` the wealth pile_up by the bondsman 's two_hundred_and_fifty year in unrequited toil '' . 
person be historian and economist enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulate in the hands of the descendants of new_englander engage in the slave_trade . 
after how many generation is such wealth ( mount all the while through the manipulation of high_finance ) purify of taint ? 
it be a question which new_englander long_ago put out of their mind . 
but did n't they get_off too easy ? 
the slave never share in their profits , while they did share , in a very real sense , in the profits of the slave owner : they were feed , clothe , doctor , and_so_forth ; they be the beneficiary of responsible , paternalistic care . 
person - platonist , idealist , doctrinaire - sound_off a high transcendental note in his `` boston_hymn '' , deliver in 1863 in the boston location amidst thundering applause : `` pay ransom to the owner and fill the bag to the brim . 
who be the owner ? 
the slave be owner , and ever be . 
pay him '' ! 
it be the abstractionism , the unrealism , of the pure idealist . 
it ignore the sordid financial aspect ( quite conveniently , too , for his audience , who could indulge in moral indignation without visible , or even conscious , discomfort , their money from the transaction having been put_away long_ago in a good antiseptic brokerage ) . 
like person , they had washed_their_hands . 
but can one , really ? 
can god be mock , ever , in_the_long_run ? 
new_englander be a_bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the declaration_of_independence , as person explain in his `` autobiography '' : `` the clause reprobate the enslaving the inhabitant of africa was strike_out in complaisance to south_carolina and georgia , who had never attempt to restrain the importation of slave , and who on_the_contrary still wish to continue it . 
our northern brother also i believe feel a_little tender under those censure ; for though their people have very few slave themselves , yet they had be pretty considerable carrier of them to others '' . 
but that be a long_time ago . 
the new_england conscience become desensitized . 
person ( naturalize new_englander ) , write in 1889 from `` paradise_road , location '' ( lovely symbolic name ) , agitate continuously the `` southern question '' . 
it be nice to be able to isolate it . 
new_england , as everyone know , has long be schoolmaster to the nation . 
there one find concentrate in a comparatively small area the chief university , college , and preparatory_school of the united_states . 
why should this be so ? 
it be true that new_england , more_than any other section , be dedicated to education from the start . 
but i think that something more than this be involved . 
how did it happen , for_example , that the state university , that great symbol of american democracy , fail to flourish in new_england as it did in other part of the country ? 
be n't it a_bit odd that the three state of southern new_england ( massachusetts , connecticut , and rhode_island ) have have state institution of university status only in the very recent past , these institution having previously be group ? 
was it suppose , perchance , that group ( vocational_training , that_is ) be quite sufficient for the immigrant_class which flood that part of the new_england world in the post civil_war period , the immigrant having been bring_in from southern europe , to work in the mill , to make_up for the labor shortage cause by migration to the west ? 
be it not ironical that person 's state , rhode_island , should have be the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university ? 
the state university of maine , new_hampshire , and vermont be old and more `` respectable '' ; they have less immigration to contend with . 
a yale historian , write a_few year ago in the yale_review , say : `` we in new_england have long_since segregate our child '' . 
he was refer not_only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory_school . 
and what a galaxy of those adorn that fair land ! 
i do n't propose to go into their history , but i have one or two surmise . 
one be that they were establish , or gain eminence , under pressure provide by these same immigrant , from whom the old family wish to segregate their child . 
in the early_days of a homogeneous population , the public_school be quite satisfactory . 
among the recipient of the nobel_prize for literature more_than half be practically unknown to reader of english . 
of these there be surely few that would be more rewarding discovery than person , the swedish poet and novelist who receive the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrate two year ago . 
equally a master of prose and verse , he recreate the glory of sweden in the past and continue it into the present . 
in the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as_much_as_possible speak_for himself . 
person be born in 1859 , of a prosperous family . 
on his father 's side he be of german descent , on his mother 's he come of the old swedish nobility . 
the family estate was situate near location on location ^ location in south central sweden . 
it be a lonely , rather desolate region , but full of legendary and historic association . 
as a boy in a local school he be shy and solitary , absorbed in his fondness for nature and his vision of sweden 's ancient glory . 
he like to fancy himself as a chieftain and to dress for the part . 
be somewhat delicate in health , at the age of sixteen he was send to southern europe , for which he at_once develop a passion , so that he spend nearly all_of the following ten year abroad , at_first in italy , then in greece , egypt , asia_minor , and palestine . 
in one of his summer at home he marry , to the great disapproval of his father , who object because of his extreme youth . 
decide to become a painter , he enter the studio of person in paris , where he enjoy the life of the artist , but soon find that whatever talent he might have did not lie_in that direction . 
he give us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem , `` the_happy_artists '' . 
`` i scan the world through printed_symbol swart , and through the beggar 's rag i strive to see the inner man . 
i look unceasingly with my cold mind and with my burning heart '' . 
in this final line , we have the key to his nature . 
few writer have better understand their deep self . 
person could never be satisfy by surface . 
it may , however , be note that his gift for color and imagery must have been greatly stimulate by his stay in paris . 
the first result of person 's long sojourn abroad be a volume of poem , pilgrimage_and_wander_years ( vallfart_och_vandringsar ) , publish in 1888 . 
it be a brilliant debut , so_much_so indeed that it arouse a new vitality in the young poet , as did person 's childe_harold . 
person ^ o ^ k , sweden 's foremost critic of the period , acclaim it as_follows : `` in this we have the verse of a painter ; strongly colorful , plastic , racy , vivid . 
in a bold , sometimes careless , form there be nothing academic ; all is see and feel and experience , the observation be sharp and the imagination lively . 
the young poet painter reproduce the french life of the street ; he tell story of the thousand_and_one_nights , and conjure_up before us the bazaar of damascus . 
in the carefree indolence of the east he see the last reflection of the old happy existence , and for that reason he love it . 
and yet amid all the gay hedonism in pilgrimage and wander-years be a cycle of short poem , '' thoughts_in_loneliness `` , filled with brooding , melancholy , and sombre longing '' . 
of the long piece of the volume none be so memorable as `` nameless_and_immortal '' , which at_once took rank among the finest poem ever written in the swedish language . 
it celebrate the unknown architect who design the temple of neptune at location , next to the parthenon the noble example of grecian classic style now in existence . 
on the eve of his return to their native location he speak with his wife of the masterpiece which rise before them in its completed perfection . 
the supreme object of their life is now fulfil , say the wife , her husband has achieve immortality . 
not so , he answer , it is not the architect but the temple that be immortal . 
`` the man 's true reputation be his work '' . 
the short poem group at the end of the volume as `` thoughts_in_loneliness '' be , as person ^ o ^ k indicate , in sharp contrast with the others . 
it consist_of fragmentary personal revelation , such_as `` the_spark '' : 
`` there be a spark dwell deep within my soul . 
to get_out it out into the daylight 's glow be my life 's aim both first and last , the whole . 
it slip_away , it burn and torture me . 
that little spark be all the wealth i know , that little spark be my life 's misery '' . 
a dominant motive be the poet 's longing for his homeland and its boyhood association : `` not man folk , but the field where i would stray , the stone where as a child i used_to play '' . 
he be utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory life he has been lead . 
what he really want be to find `` a sacred cause '' to which he can honestly devote himself . 
this restless individualism find its answer when he return to live nearly all the rest of his life in sweden . 
his cause be to commemorate the glory of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present . 
he did not , however , find_oneself at_once . 
his next major work , complete in 1892 , be a long fantastic epic in prose , entitle hans_alienus , which person ^ o ^ k describe as a monument on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth . 
the hero , who be himself , is represent as a pilgrim in the storied land of the east , a sort_of person type , who , to quote from person ^ o ^ k again , `` even in the pleasure garden of sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life . 
he is drive back by his yearning to the wintry homeland of his father in the forest of location '' . 
from this time on person proceed to find his deep self . 
by the death of his father in 1888 he had come_into possession of the family estate and had re-assume its tradition . 
he did not , however , settle back into acquiescence with thing as they be . 
like his friend and contemporary person he have little patience with collective mediocrity . 
he see sweden as a country of smug and narrow provincialism , indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory . 
person 's remedy for this condition be to tear_down the old structure and build anew from the ground up . 
person 's conception , on_the_contrary , be to revive the present by the memory of the past . 
whether in prose or poetry , all_of person 's later work be concerned with sweden . 
with the first of a group of historical novel , the_charles_men_(_karolinerna ) , publish in 1897_-_8 , he achieve the masterpiece of his career . 
in scope and power it can only be compare to person 's war_and_peace . 
about one-third as long , it be less intimate and detailed , but better coordinate , more concise and more dramatic . 
though it center around the brilliant and enigmatic figure of person , , the true hero be not finally the king himself . 
hence the title of the book , refer to the soldier and subject of the king ; on the fatal battlefield of location , to quote from the novel , `` the wreath he twine for himself slip down upon his people '' . 
the_charles_men consist_of not of a connected narrative but of a group of short_story , each depict a special phase of the general subject . 
somewhat uneven in interest for an average reader , eight or ten of these be among the finest of their kind in literature . 
they comprise a great variety of scene and interest : grim episode of war , idyllic interlude , superb canvas of world-shaking event , and delightfully humorous sketch of odd character . 
the general effect be tragic . 
almost nothing is say of person ' spectacular victory , the central theme be the heroic loyalty of the swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune and defeat . 
to carry_out this exalted conception the author has combine the vivid realism and imaginative power we have notice in his early poetry and carry_out them out on a grand scale . 
his peculiar gift , as had been suggest before , be his intensity . 
person has say that fervor be the core of style . 
of few author be this more true than of person . 
the_charles_men have a tremendous range of character , of common folk even more_than of major figure . 
the career of person , be obviously very similar to that of napoleon . 
his ideal be person , as napoleon 's be julius_caesar . 
his purpose , however , be not to establish an empire , but to assert the principle of divine justice . 
each aspire to be a god in human form , but with each it be a different kind of god . 
each fail catastrophically in an invasion of russia and each bring ruin on the country that worship him . 
each is still glorify as a national hero . 
the first half of the_charles_men , end on the climax of the battle of location in 1709 , be more dramatically coherent than the second . 
after the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerate for a time into a futility that be not merely pitiable but often ridiculous . 
like napoleon , he be the worst of loser . 
there be , however , some wonderful chapter at the beginning of the second part , concern the reaction of the swede in adversity . 
then more_than ever before did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness . 
this come_out in `` when_the_bells_ring '' , which describe the rallying of the peasant in southern sweden to repel an invasion by the dane . 
in `` the_king 's_ride '' , person break_out of a long period of petulance and inertia , regain his old self , escape from turkey , and finally reach his own land after an absence of eighteen year . 
he find it in utter misery and desolation . 
all his people ask for be no more war . 
but he plunge into yet another , this time with norway , and is kill in an assault on the fortress of location , being only thirty-six year of_age when he die . 
he had become king at fifteen . 
then suddenly there be a tremendous revulsion of popular feeling . 
from be a hated tyrant and madman he be now the symbol of all that be noble and best in the history of sweden . 
this is bring_out in the next-to-last chapter of the book , `` a_hero 's funeral '' , write in the form of an impassioned prose_poem . 
slowly the procession of warrior and statesman pass_through the snow beside the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral , the shrine of so many precious memory . 
the gun are fire , the hymn are sing , and the body of person is carry down to the vault and lay beside the tomb of his ancestor . 
as he had long to be , he become the echo of a saga . 
person write four other work of fiction about early figure revere in swedish memory . 
excellent in their way , they lack the wide appeal of the_charles_men , and need not detain us here . 
it be different with his volume the_swedes_and_their_chieftains ( svenskarna_och_deras_ho ^_vdingar ) , a history intend for the general reader and particularly suited for high_school student . 
admirably write , it be a perfect introduction to swedish history for reader of other country . 
some of the early episode have touch of the supernatural , as suit to the legendary background . 
these be suggestive_of person ^ f . 
especially touching be the chapter , `` the_little_sister '' , about a king 's daughter who become a nun in the convent of location . 
the record teem with romance and adventure . 
person be a superb example , and person , , the conqueror of denmark , hardly less so . 
of person and person , it be unnecessary to speak_of . 
today the private_detective will also investigate insurance_claim or handle divorce case , but his primary function remain what it has always be , to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not . 
it is from this unpromising background that the fictional private_detective was recruit . 
the mythological private_eye differ from his counterpart in real life in two essential way . 
on_the_one_hand , he does not work for a large agency , but be almost always self-employed . 
as a freelance investigator , the fictional detective be responsible to no person but himself and his client . 
for this reason , he appear as an independent and self-reliant figure , whose rugged individualism need not be press into the mold of a 9 to 5 routine . 
on_the_other_hand , the fictional detective does not break strike or handle divorce case ; no client would ever think_of ask him to do such thing . 
whatever his original assignment , the fictional private_eye end_up by investigate and solve a crime , usually a murder . 
operate as a one-man police_force in fact if not in_name , he be at_once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves . 
he catch criminal not merely because he is pay to do so ( frequently he does not receive a fee at_all ) , but because he enjoy his work , because he firmly believe that murder must be punish . 
thus the fictional detective be much more_than a simple businessman . 
he be , first_and_foremost , a defender of public morals , a servant of society . 
it is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which account_for the great appeal of the mythological detective . 
by_virtue_of his self-reliance , his individualism and his freedom from external restraint , the private_eye be a perfect embodiment of the middle_class conception of liberty , which amount to do what you please and let_the_devil_take_the_hindmost . 
at_the_same_time , because the personal code of the detective coincide with the legal dictate of his society , because he like to catch criminal , he be in middle_class eyes a virtuous man . 
in this way , the private_detective get the best of two possible world . 
he be an individualist but not an anarchist ; he be a public servant but not a cop . 
in_short , the fictional private_eye be a specialized version of person 's ideal entrepreneur , the man whose private ambition must always and everywhere promote the public welfare . 
in the mystery_story , as in the_wealth_of_nations , individualism and the social good be two side of the same benevolent coin . 
there is only one catch to this idyllic arrangement : 
person be wrong . 
not_only did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest number , he end by destroy himself , by give birth to monopoly capitalism . 
the rise of the giant corporation in western europe and the united_states date_from the period 1880 - 1900 . 
now , although the root of the mystery_story in serious literature go_back as far as balzac , person , and person , it was not until the closing decade of the 19th century that the private_detective become an established figure in popular fiction . 
sherlock_holmes , the ancestor of all private_eye , was bear during the 1890 s . 
thus the transformation of person 's ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincide closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life . 
drive from the marketplace by the course of history , our hero disguise himself as a private_detective . 
the birth of the myth compensate for the death of the ideal . 
even on the fictional level , however , the contradiction which give_rise to the mystery_story are not fully resolve . 
the individualism and public service of the private_detective both stem from his dedication to a personal code_of_conduct : he enforce the law without being tell to do so . 
the private_eye be therefore a moral man ; but his morality rest_on upon that of his society . 
the basic premise of all mystery_story be that the distinction between good and bad coincide with the distinction between legal and illegal . 
unfortunately , this assumption does not always hold good . 
as capitalism in the 20th century has become increasingly dependent upon force and violence for its survival , the private_detective is place in a serious dilemma . 
if he be good , he may not be legal ; if he be legal , he may not be good . 
it be the gradual unfolding and deepening of_this contradiction which create the inner dialectic of the evolution of the mystery_story . 
with the advent of person 's sherlock_holmes , the development of the modern private_detective begin . 
sherlock_holmes be not merely an individualist ; he be very close to be a mental_case . 
a brief list of the great detective 's little idiosyncrasy would provide person with ample food_for_thought . 
holmes be addicted to the use of cocaine and other refreshing stimulant ; he be prone to semi catatonic trance induce by the playing of the violin ; he be a recluse , an incredible egotist , a confirmed misogynist . 
holmes rebel against the social convention of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds . 
his eccentricity begin as a defense against boredom . 
it was in_order to avoid the stuffy routine of middle_class life that holmes become a detective in_the_first_place . 
as he inform person , `` my life is spend in one long effort to escape_from the commonplace of existence . 
these little problem help me to do so '' . 
holmes be a public servant , to_be_sure ; but the society which he serve bore him to tears . 
the curious relationship between holmes and scotland_yard provide an important clue to the deep significance of his eccentric behavior . 
although he be perfectly willing to cooperate with scotland_yard , holmes have nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality of the police . 
they for their part be convinced that holmes be too `` unorthodox '' and `` theoretical '' to make a good detective . 
why do the police find holmes `` unorthodox '' ? 
on_the_face_of_it , it is because he employ deductive technique alien to official police routine . 
another , more interesting explanation , is hint at by person when he observe on several occasion that holmes would have make a magnificent criminal . 
the great detective modestly agree . 
person 's insight is verify by the mysterious link between holmes and his arch opponent , person . 
the two man resemble each other closely in their cunning , their egotism , their relentlessness . 
the first series of sherlock_holmes adventure end with holmes and person grapple together on the edge of a cliff . 
they are presume to have plunge to a common grave in_this fatal embrace . 
link to holmes even in death , person represent the alter_ego of the great detective , the image of_what our hero might have become be he not a public servant . 
just as holmes the eccentric stand behind holmes the detective , so holmes the potential criminal lurk behind both . 
in the modern english `` whodunit '' , this insinuation of latent criminality in the detective himself has almost entirely disappear . 
person and person ( the respective creation of person and person ) have retain holmes ' egotism but not his zest for life and eccentric habit . 
person and his counterpart be perfectly respectable people ; it be true that they be also extremely dull . 
their dedication to the status_quo has been affirm at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism of a sherlock_holmes . 
the latter 's real descendent be unable to take_root in england ; they flee from the victorian parlor and make_one's_way their way across the stormy atlantic . 
in the american `` hard-boiled '' detective_story of the ' 20 s and ' 30 s , the spirit of the mad genius from location live on . 
like holmes , the american private_eye reject the social convention of his time . 
but unlike holmes , he feel his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt . 
surrounded by crime and violence everywhere , the `` hard-boiled '' private_eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed isolation . 
his alienation be far more acute than holmes ' ; he be not an eccentric but rather an outcast . 
with person 's person , alienation is represent on a purely physical plane . 
person refuse to ever leave his own house , and spend most_of his time drink beer and play with orchid . 
more profound and more disturbing , however , be the moral isolation of person 's person . 
in a society where everything be for_sale , person be the only man who cannot be buy . 
his tough honesty condemn him to a solitary and difficult existence . 
beaten , bruised and exhausted , he pursue the elusive killer through the demimonde of high_society and low morals , always alone , always despised . 
in_the_end , he get his man , but no one seem to care ; virtue be its own and only reward . 
a similar tone of underlying futility and despair pervade the spy thriller of person and dominate the most famous of all american mystery_story , person 's the maltese_falcon . 
person join_forces with a band of adventurer in search of a priceless jeweled statue of a falcon ; but when the bird is find at_last , it turn_out to be a fake . 
now the detective must save his own skin by inform on the girl he love , who be also the real murderer . 
for person , neither crime nor virtue pay ; moreover , it be increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two . 
because the private_eye intend to save society in_spite_of himself , he invariably find himself in_trouble with the police . 
the latter be either too stupid to catch the killer or too corrupt to care . 
in either case , they do not appreciate the private_detective 's zeal . 
person and person , person and person spend more time fight each other than they do in look_for the criminal . 
frequently enough , the police be themselves in_league_with the killer ; person 's red_harvest provide a classic example of_this theme . 
but even when the police be honest , they do not trust the private_eye . 
he be , like person , too alienated to be reliable . 
finally , in the maltese_falcon among others , the clash between detective and police is carry to its logical conclusion : person become the chief murder_suspect . 
in_order to exonerate himself , he is compel to find the real criminal , who happen to be his girlfriend . 
what be only a vague suspicion in the case of sherlock_holmes now appear as a direct accusation : the private_eye be in danger of turn_into his opposite . 
it is the growing contradiction between individualism and public service in the mystery_story which create this fatal dilemma . 
by uphold his own personal code_of_behavior , the private_detective has place himself in opposition to a society whose fabric be permeated with crime and corruption . 
that society respond by condemn the private_eye as a threat to the status_quo , a potential criminal . 
if the detective insist upon retain his personal standard , he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society . 
he must , in_short , cease to be a detective and become a rebel . 
on_the_other_hand , if he wish to continue in his chosen profession , he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism . 
person resolve this contradiction by cease to write mystery_story and turn_to other pursuit . 
his successor have adopt the opposite alternative . 
in_order to save the mystery_story , they have convert the private_detective into an organization man . 
the first of two possible variation on this theme is symbolize by person 's person . 
at_first_glance , this hero seem to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessor . 
for person , nothing be forbidden . 
he kill when he please , take his woman where he find them and always act_as judge , jury and executioner rolled_into_one . 
it will be show that the objective of the cooperative people in an organization determine the type of network require , because the type of network function according to the characteristic of the message enumerate in table 1 . 
great stress is place on the role that the monitoring of information send play in maintain the effectiveness of the network . 
by monitoring , we mean some system of control over the type of information send from the various center . 
as a word of caution , we should be aware that in actual practice no message be purely one of the four type , question , command , statement , or exclamation . 
for_example , suppose a man wear a $ 200 watch , drive a 1959 rolls_royce , stop to ask a man on the sidewalk , `` what time be it '' ? 
this sentence would have most_of the characteristic of a question , but it have some of the characteristic of a statement because the questioner has convey the fact that he have no faith in his own timepiece or the one attach to his car . 
if the man on the sidewalk is surprise at this question , it has serve as an exclamation . 
also , since the man question feel a strong compulsion to answer ( and thereby avoid the consequence of being think queer ) the question has assume some measurable property of a command . 
however , for convenience we will stick_to the idea that information can be classify according to table 1 . 
on this basis , certain extreme kind of network will be discuss for illustrative purpose . 
presumably a cocktail_party is expect to fulfill the host 's desire to get_together a number of people who be inadequately acquainted and thereby arrange for bring the level of acquaintance up to adequacy for future cooperative endeavor . 
the party be usually in a room small enough so that all guest be within sight and hearing of one another . 
the information is furnish by each of the guest , is send by oral broadcast over the air_wave , and is receive by the ear . 
since the air be a continuum , the network of communication remain intact regardless of the position or motion of the point ( the people ) in the net . 
as show in figure 1 , there be a connection for communication between every pair of point . 
this , and other qualification , make the cocktail_party the most complete and most chaotic communication_system ever dream_up . 
all four type of message list in table 1 are permit , although decorum and cocktail_party tradition require hold the command to a minimum , while exclamation have complimentary intonation are more_than customarily encourage . 
the completeness of the connection provide that , for n people , there be * * f line of communication between the pair , which can become a large_number ( 1225 ) for a party of fifty guest . 
look at the diagram , we see that * * f connection line come in to each member . 
thus the cocktail_party would appear to be the ideal system , but there be one weakness . 
in_spite_of the dream of the host for oneness in the group , the * * f incoming message for each guest overload his receiving_system beyond comprehension if n exceed about six . 
the crowd consequently break_up into temporary group range in size from two to six , with a half_life for the cluster range from three to twenty minute . 
for the occasion on which everyone already know everyone else and the host wish them to meet one or a_few honored newcomer , then the `` open_house '' system be advantageous because the honored guest be fixed connective point and the drifting guest make and break connection at the door . 
we consider a rural community as an assemblage of inhabited dwelling whose configuration is determine by the location and size of the arable land_site necessary for family subsistence . 
we assume for this illustration that the size of the land plot be so great that the distance between dwelling be greater than the voice can carry and that most_of the communication be between near neighbor only , as show in figure 2 . 
information beyond near neighbor is carry secondhand - , third - , and fourth hand as a distortable rumor . 
in figure 2 , the point in the network are designate by a letter accompany by a number . 
the number indicate the number of near neighbor . 
it will be note that point f have seven near neighbor , h and e have six , and p have only one , while the remaining point have intermediate number . 
in any social_system in which communication have an importance comparable_with that of production and other human factor , a point like f in figure 2 would ( other thing be equal ) be the dwelling place for the community leader , while e and h would house the next most important citizen . 
a point like p get information directly from n , but all information beyond n is indirectly relay through n . 
the dweller at p be last to hear about a new cure , the slow to announce to his neighbor his urgent distress , the one who go the farthest to trade , and the one with the great difficulty of all in put_over an idea or get people to join him in a cooperative effort . 
since the hazard of poor communication be so great , p can be justify as a habitable site only on the basis of unusual productivity such_as be make available by a waterfall for mill purpose , a mine , or a sugar_maple camp . 
location theorist have give these matter much consideration . 
the network for military communication be one of the best example of network which not_only must be change with the change in objective but also must be change with the addition of new machine of war . 
they also furnish proof that , in modern war , message sending must be monitor . 
without monitor , a military hookup become a noisy party . 
the need for monitor become greater when radio was adopt for military signaling . 
alexander_the_great , who use runner as message carrier , did not have to worry about have every officer in his command hear what he say and have hundred of them comment at_once . 
as time has pass and science has progress , the speed of military_vehicle has increase , the range of missile has been extend , the use of target-hunting nose on the projectile has been adopt , and the range and breadth of message send has increase . 
next to the old problem of the slowness of decision_making , network structure seem to be paramount , and without monitor no network have value . 
on the parade_ground the net may be similar to that show in figure 3 . 
the monitoring be the high and most restrictive of any organization in existence . 
no question , statement , or explanation are permit - only command . 
command go only from an officer to the man of near lower_rank . 
the same command is repeat as_many time as there be level in rank from general to corporal . 
all order originate with the officer of high rank and terminate with action of the man in the rank . 
even the officer in_charge , be it a captain ( for small display ) or a general , is restrain by monitor . 
this is do for simplicity of command and to bring the hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding have almost zero possibility . 
the command are specify by the military regulation ; be few in number , briefly word , all different in sound ; and be combinable into sequence which permit any march maneuver that could be desire on a parade_ground . 
this monitoring be necessary because , on a parade_ground , everyone can hear too_much , and without monitor a confused social_event would develop . 
with troops disperse on field_of_battle rather than on the parade_ground , it may seem that a certain amount of monitor is automatically enforce by the line of communication . 
years ago this be true , but with the replacement of wire or runner by radio and radar ( and perhaps television ) , these restriction have disappear and now again too_much is hear . 
in contrast to cocktail_party , military organization , even in the field , be more formal . 
in the extreme and oversimplified example suggest in figure 3 , the organization is more easily understand and more predictable in behavior . 
a military organization have an objective choose by the high command . 
this objective is adhere to throughout the duration of the action . 
the connective system , or network , is tailor to meet the requirement of the objective , and it be therefore not surprising that a military body act_as a single coordinated unit have a different communication network than a factory , a college , or a rural village . 
the assumption upon which the example show in figure 3 is base be : ( a ) one man can direct about six subordinate if the subordinate are choose carefully so that they do not need too_much personal coach , indoctrinate , etc. . 
( b ) a message run_a_risk too great a risk of being distort if it is to be relay more than about six consecutive time . 
( c ) decision of a general kind are make by the central command . 
and ( d ) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission is relegate to the line of man on the lower_rank . 
these assumption lead to an organization with one man at the top , six directly under him , six under each of these , and_so_on until there be six level of personnel . 
the number of people act_as one body by this scheme give a surprisingly large army of * * f 55987 man . 
this organizational network would be of no avail if there be no regulation pertaining to the type of message send . 
of type of message list in table 1 , command and statement be the only ones send through the vertical network show in figure 3 . 
a further regulation be that command always go_down , unaccompanied by statement , and statement always go_up , unaccompanied by command . 
question and , particularly , exclamation are usually channel along informal , horizontal line not indicate in figure 3 and seldom are carry beyond the near neighbor . 
it will readily be see that in this suggested network ( not materially different from some of the network in_vogue today ) greater emphasis on monitor is imply than is usually put into practice . 
furthermore , the network in figure 3 be only the basic net through which other network pertaining to logistics and the_like are interlace . 
not discuss here are some military problem of modern_times such_as undersea warfare , where the surveillance , sending , transmitting , and receiving be all so inadequate that network and decision_making be not the bottleneck . 
such problem be of extreme interest as well as importance and be so much like fight in a rain_forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to reexamine primitive conflict for what they could teach . 
this be an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigate , although one frequently hear the comment that we have insufficient specialist of the kind who can compete with the german or swiss , for_example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the finn in geochemistry . 
we hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalist who can see the overall picture and combine our national skill and knowledge for useful purpose . 
this problem of the optimum balance in the relative number of generalist and specialist can be investigate on a communicative network basis . 
since the difficulty of draw the net be great , we will merely discuss it . 
first , we realize that a pure specialist does not exist . 
but , for practical purpose , we have people who can be consider as such . 
for_example , there be person who be in physical_science , in the field of mineralogy , train in crystallography , who use only x_ray , apply only the powder_technique of x-ray_diffraction , to clay mineral only , and who have spend the last fifteen year concentrate_on the montmorillonites ; or person in the social_science in the field of anthropology , study the lung capacity of seven andean indian . 
so we see that a specialist be a man who know more and more about less and less as he develop , as contrast to the generalist , who know less and less about more and more . 
american democratic thought , point_up the relation between the protestant movement in_this country and the development of a social religion , which he call the american democratic faith . 
those familiar_with his work will remember that he place the incipience of the democratic faith at around 1850 . 
and he describe it as a balanced polarity between the notion of the free individual and what he call the fundamental_law . 
i want to say more about person 's so-called fundamental_law . 
but first i want to quote him on the relationship that he find between religion and politics in_this country and what happen to it . 
he point_out that from the time of person on through world_war_1 , , evangelical protestantism be a dominant influence in the social and political life of america . 
he term this early enthusiasm `` romantic_christianity '' and conclude that its similarity to democratic belief of_that day be so great that `` the doctrine of liberty seem but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical protestantism '' . 
let me quote him even more fully , for his analysis be important to my theme . 
he say : `` beside the protestant philosophy of progress , as express in radical or conservative millenarianism , should be place the doctrine of the democratic faith which affirm it to be the duty of the destiny of the united_states to assist in the creation of a better world by keep lighted the beacon of democracy '' . 
he specify , `` in the middle period of the nineteenth century it was color by christian supernaturalism , in the twentieth century it was affect by naturalism . 
but in every period it has be humanism '' . 
and let me add , utopianism , also . 
some fourteen or fifteen year ago , in an essay i call the leader_follows - where ? 
i use his polarity to illustrate what i think had happen to us in_that form of liberalism we call progressivism . 
it seem to me that the liberal had scrap the balanced polarity and repose both liberty and the fundamental_law in the common_man . 
that_is_to_say person 's fundamental_law had been so much modify by this time that it be neither fundamental nor law anymore . 
it be a weakness of person 's analysis that he never seem to realize that his so-called fundamental_law had already been cut loose from its foundation when it was adapt to democracy . 
and with progressivism the religion_of_humanity was replace what person call christian supernaturalism . 
and the common_man was develop mythic power , or charisma , on_his_own . 
during the decade that follow , the common_man , as that piece put it , grow uncomfortable as the voice of god and flee from behind person ) only to learn from science , to his shocked relief that after_all there be no god he had to speak_for and that he be just an animal anyhow - that there was a chemical_formula for him , and that too much could n't be expect of him . 
the socialism implicit_in the slogan of the roosevelt revolution , freedom from want and fear , seem a far cry from the individualism of the first_amendment to the constitution , or of the jacksonian frontier . 
what had happen to the common_man ? 
french egalitarianism had have only nominal influence in_this country before the day of popularism . 
the riotous onrush of industrialism after the war_for_southern_independence and the general secular drift to the religion_of_humanity , however , prepare the way for a reception of the french_revolution 's socialistic offspring of one sort of another . 
the first of_which to find important place in our federal_government be the graduated income_tax under person . 
moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920 s , the dislocation of the depression , the common ethos of materialism everywhere , all contribute in various way to the face_lifting that replace person and the great_gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy of the little_people . 
however , it be important to trace the philosophy of the french_revolution to its source to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence of the latter on the former . 
that john_locke 's philosophy of the social_contract father the american_revolution with its declaration_of_independence , i believe , we generally accept . 
yet , after rousseau had give the social_contract a new twist with his notion of the general will , the same philosophy , it may be say , become the idea source of the french_revolution also . 
the importance of rousseau 's twist has not always be clear to us , however . 
this notion of the general will give_rise to the commune_of_paris in the revolution and later bring napoleon to dictatorship . 
and it is clearly argue by person of newcastle , in his remarkable long essay , the heresy_of_democracy , and in a more general way by person , in his new_science_of_politics , that this same rousseauan idea , descend through european democracy , be the source of person 's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat . 
this be important to understand the position that doctrinaire liberal find themselves in after world_war_2 , and our great democratic victory that bring no peace . 
the long road that had take liberal in_this country into the social religion of democracy , into a worship of man , lead logically to the marxist dream of a classless society under a socialist state . 
and the ussr exist as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar . 
and by the time the war end , liberal leadership in_this country be spiritually marxist . 
we will recall that the still confident liberal of the person administration gather with other western utopian in san_francisco to set_up the legal framework , finally and at_last , to rationalize war - to rationalize want and fear - out of the world : the united_nations . 
we of the liberal led world get all set for peace and rehabilitation . 
then suddenly we find ourselves in the middle of another fight , an irrational , an indecent , an undeclared and immoral war with our strong ( and some had think noble ) ally . 
during the next five year the leaders of the fair_deal reluctantly back_down from the optimistic expectation of the new_deal . 
during the next five year liberal leaders in the united_states sink in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifest in a negative policy of containment - and the bitter irony - enforce and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we feel the greatest distaste for but could not abandon : 
the atom_bomb . 
in 1952 , it will be remember , the group without positive program campaign on the popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and win overwhelmingly . 
all_of this , i know , be recent history familiar to you . 
but i have be at some pains to review it as the drama of the common_man , to point_up what happen to him under person 's leadership . 
a perceptive journalist , person , has phrase it in the title of one of his book as the revolt of the moderate . 
he open his discourse , however , with a review of the person inaugural festivity at which a sympathetic press had assemble its massive talent , all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age . 
the show be colorful , indeed , exuberant , but the press for all its assiduity could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny . 
person offer his book as an explanation of why there was no clue . 
and i select this sentence as its pertinent summation : `` in_essence the drama of his ( person 's ) presidency can be describe as the ordeal of a nation turn conservative and struggle - thus_far with but limited and precarious success - to give effective voice and force to_that conservatism '' . 
i will assume that we be all aware of the continuing struggle , with its limited and precarious success , toward conservatism . 
it has move_on various level , it has be clamorous and confused . 
obviously there has be no agreement on what american conservatism be , or rather , what it should be . 
for it was neglect , not to say nascent , when the struggle begin . 
i see a piece the other day assail person , author of man_and_god_at_yale and publisher of the national_review , as no conservative at_all , but an old liberal . 
i would agree with this view . 
but i be not here to define conservatism . 
what i be here to do be to report on the gyration of the struggle - a struggle that amount to self redefinition - to see if we can predict its future course . 
one of the obvious conclusion we can make on the basis of the last election , i suppose , be that we , the majority , be dissatisfied with person conservatism . 
though , to_be_sure , we give person no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment . 
this be , however , symptomatic_of our national malaise . 
but before i try to diagnose it , i would offer other evidence . 
i will mention two volume of specific comment on this malaise that appear last year . 
the earlier of them be an unofficial enterprise , sponsor by life magazine , under the title of the national purpose . 
the contributor to this testament be all well-known : 
a former democratic candidate for president , a new_deal poet , the magazine 's chief editorial writer , two newspaper_columnist , head of a national broadcasting_company , a popular protestant evangelist , etc. . 
what i want to point_out here be that all_of them be ex liberal , or modified liberal , with perhaps one exception . 
i suppose we might classify person as an old liberal . 
and i would further note that they all - with one exception again - sing in one key or another the same song . 
its refrain be : `` let us return to the individualistic democracy of our forefather for our salvation '' . 
person express some reservation about this return . 
others invoke technology and common_sense . 
only person envision the possibility of our having `` outlive most_of what we used_to regard_as the program of our national purpose '' . 
but the most notable thing about the incantation of these ex liberal be that the onetime shibboleth of socialism be conspicuously absent . 
the second specific comment be the report of person 's commission_on_national_goals , titled goals_for_americans . 
they , perhaps , give the pitch of their position in the preface where it was say that person request that the commission be administer by the group , because it be nonpartisan . 
the commission seem to represent the viewpoint of_what i would call the unconscious liberal , but not unconscious enough , to invoke the now taboo symbolism of socialism . 
and here again we hear the same refrain mention above : `` the paramount goal of the united_states , set long_ago , was to guard the right of the individual , ensure his development , enlarge his opportunity '' . 
this group be secularist and their program tend to be technological . 
but it be the need to undertake these testament that i would submit here as symptom of the common_man 's malaise . 
and let me add person 's new book as another symptom of_it , particularly so in_view_of the attention time magazine give it when it come_out recently . 
person go_back to the declaration_of_independence , too , though i may add , with considerably more historical perception . 
i will reserve discussion of_it for a moment , however , to return to person . 
as symptomatic_of the common_man 's malaise , he be most significant : a liberal and a catholic , elect by the skin_of_his_teeth . 
does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy , not to say confused , state of the public mind ? 
what be the common_man 's complaint ? 
let 's take a panoramic look back over the course we have come . 
has not that way been light always by the lamp of liberalism up until the turning back under person ? 
and the basic character of_that liberalism has be spiritual rather than economic . 
person give it the name of protestant philosophy of progress . 
but there be a subjective side to_that utopian outlook . 
does our society have a runaway , uncontrollable growth of technology which may end our civilization , or a normal , healthy growth ? 
here there may be an analogy with cancer : we can detect cancer by their rapidly accelerating growth , determinable only_when related_to the more normal rate of healthy growth . 
should the accelerating growth of technology then warn us ? 
note such evidence be the first_step ; and almost the only `` cure '' be early detection and removal . 
one way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology would be to check the strength of our society 's organs to see if their functioning be as healthy as before . 
so an objective look at our present procedure may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation . 
in_any_event , whether society may have cancer , or merely a virus infection , the `` disease '' , we shall find , be political , economical , social , and even medical . 
have not our physical_ability already deteriorate because of the more sedentary life we are now live ? 
hence the prime issue , as i see it , be whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind , or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own need as a force of nature . 
we are already commit to establish man 's supremacy over nature and everywhere on earth , not merely in the limited social political economical context we be fond of today . 
otherwise , we go_on endlessly try to draw_the_line , color and other , as to which kind_of man we wish to see dominate . 
we have prove so able to solve technological problem that to contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else . 
we must believe we have the ability to affect our own destiny : otherwise why try anything ? 
so in these page the term `` technology '' is use to include any and all means which could amplify , project , or augment man 's control over himself and over other man . 
naturally this include all communication form , e.g. language , or any social , political , economic or religious structure employ for such control . 
properly mindful of all the culture in existence today throughout the world , we must employ these resource without war or violent revolution . 
if we were create a wholly new society , we could insist that our social , political , economic and philosophic institution foster rather than hamper man ; best growth . 
but we cannot start off with a clean_slate . 
so we must first analyze our present institution with_respect_to the effect of each on man 's major need . 
ask which institution most need correction , i would say the corporation as it exist in america today . 
at_first_glance this appear strange : of all people , was not america found by rugged_individualist who establish a new way_of_life still inspire `` undeveloped '' society abroad ? 
but hear person , former moscow correspondent of group , and author of `` to_moscow_-_and_beyond '' . 
in a book review of `` the_soviet_cultural_offensive '' , he say , `` long before the state_department organize its bureaucracy into an group in_order to wage a cultural counteroffensive within soviet border , the sharp cutting_edge of american culture had carve its mark across the russian steppe , as when the enterprising promoter of ' porgy_and_bess ' override the state_department to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare ' behind the enemy line . 
they be not diplomat or jazz_musician , or even organizer of reading_room and photomontage display , but rugged capitalist entrepreneur like henry_ford , person , person , the group , and person . 
their kind create an american culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrate russia as it do almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directive or program a series of consultation of interested agency . 
this favorable image of america in the mind of russian man and woman be still there despite years of energetic anti american propaganda '' . 
perhaps the public 's present attitude toward business stem from the fact that the `` rugged capitalist entrepreneur '' no_more exist in america . 
in his stead be a milquetoast version known_as `` the corporation '' . 
but even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristic in this new image of america , foreigner can ; and our loss of `` prestige '' abroad be the direct result . 
no amount of ballyhoo will cover_up the sordid fact . 
if we want respect from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it . 
first , let us realize that whatever good this setup achieve in earlier time , now the corporation per_se cannot take economic leadership . 
business must develop as a result of the idea , energy and ambition of an individual have purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind . 
when we `` force '' individual to assume the corporate structure by means of tax and other legal statute , we adopt what i would term `` pseudo capitalism '' and so take a major step toward socialism . 
the biggest loss , of_course , be the individual 's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy . 
socialism , i grant , have a definite place in our society . 
but let us not complain of the evil of capitalism by refer to a form that be not truly capitalistic . 
some form of capitalism do indeed work - superb organization , a credit to any society . 
but the pseudo capitalism which dictate our whole economy as_well as our politics and social life , will not stand close scrutiny . 
its pretense to operate in the public interest be little more than a sham . 
it serve only its own stockholder and poorly at that . 
as a creative enterprise , its ability be primarily in `` swallow '' creative enterprise develop outside its own organization ( an ability make possible by us , and almost mandatory ) . 
as to benefit to employee , it be notorious for its callous disregard except where it depend_on them for services . 
the corporation in america be in_reality our form of socialism , vie in_a_sense with the other socialistic form that has emerge within governmental bureaucracy . 
but while the corporation have all the disadvantage of the socialist form of organization ( so cumbersome it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status_quo ) , unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism , the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as_a_whole . 
so we are face with a vast network of amorphous entity perpetuate themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard_to the need of society , control society and force upon it a regime represent only the corporation 's need for survival . 
the corporation have a limited , specific place in our society . 
ideally speak , it should be allow to operate only where the public have a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the action of a single proprietor be secondary to the need of society . 
example be in public utility , make military aircraft and accessory , or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by_any_means other_than the corporate form , e.g. construct major airport or dam . 
thus , if corporation are not to run_away with us , they must become quasi governmental institution , subject_to public control and need . 
in all other area , private initiative of the `` proprietorship '' type should be urge to produce the desired goods and services . 
avoid runaway technology can be do only by assure a humane society ; and for this human_being must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rest . 
such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer , corporation cannot . 
it can project long-range goal for itself . 
corporation react violently to short-range stimulus , e.g. , quarterly and annual dividend report . 
proprietorship can establish a unity and integrity of control ; corporation , be more amorphous , cannot . 
proprietorship can establish a meaningful identity , represent a human personality , and thus establish sincere relationship with customer and community . 
corporation be apt by_nature to be impersonal , inhumane , shortsighted and almost exclusively profit motivated , a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public . 
the proprietor be able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate structure with its board_of_directors and stockholder . 
leadership be lacking in our society because it have no legitimate place to develop . 
man continuously at the head of grow enterprise can acquire experience of the most varied , complicated and trying type so that at maturation they have develop the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so sorely need now . 
hence government must establish great control upon corporation so that their activity promote what is deem essential to the national interest . 
proprietorship should get the tax_advantage now accrue to corporation , e.g. the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth . 
corporation should pay added tax , to be use for educational purpose ( not necessarily of the formal type ) . 
the right to leave legacy should be substantially reduce and ultimately eliminate . 
to perpetuate wealth control lead by small group of individual who play no role in its creation prevent those with real initiative from come_to_the_fore , and be basically anti democratic . 
when the proprietor die , the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquire by another proprietor or the government decide to drop it . 
strike should be declare illegal against corporation because disagreement would have to be settle by government representative act_as controller of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would now be define against proprietorship because employee and proprietor must be completely interdependent , as they be each a part of the whole . 
strike threaten the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship . 
certainly external force should not be apply arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so . 
if we cannot stop warfare in our own economic_system , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ? 
these proposal would go_far toward create the economic atmosphere favor growth of the individual , who , in_turn , would help us to cope_with runaway technology . 
individual human strength is need to pit against an inhuman condition . 
the battle be not easy . 
we are tempt to blame others for our problem rather than look them straight in the face and realize they be of_our_own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed , enlightened , competent leader . 
person develop in today 's corporation cannot hope to serve here - a judgment base on experience of my own in business and in activity outside . 
in my own company , in_effect a partnership , although legally a corporation , i have be able to do many thing for my employee which `` normal '' corporation of comparable size and nature would have be unable to do . 
also , i be convinced that if my company be a sole proprietorship instead of a partnership , i would have be even able to solve long-range problem for myself and my fellow employee . 
any ability i may have were achieve in their present shape from experience in share_in the growth and control of my business , couple with raise my family . 
this combined experience , on a foundation of very average , i assure you , intelligence and background , has help me do thing many well-informed people would bet heavily against . 
perhaps a list of some of the `` practice '' of my company will help here . 
the company grow out of effort by two completely inexperienced man in their late twenties , neither have a formal education applicable to , or experience in , manufacturing or selling our type of article . 
from an initial investment of $ 1200 in 1943 , it has grow , with no additional capital investment , to a present value estimate by some as exceed $ 10000000 ( we do n't disclose financial figure to the public ) . 
its growth continue steadily on a par with past growth ; and no limitation be in_evidence . 
our pin-curl clip and self-locking nut achieve dominance in just a_few year time , despite substantial , well established competition . 
during the last year of person 's administration , a red_scare develop in our country . 
many american react irrationally to the challenge of russia and turn_to the repression of idea by force . 
postmaster_general person set_about to protect the american people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the mail . 
attorney_general person make a series of raid that send more_than 4000 so-called radical to the jail , in direct violation of their constitutional right . 
then , not many year later , the group , under the leadership of person , pillory hundred of decent , patriotic citizen . 
anyone who try to remedy some of the most glaring defect in our form of democracy was denounce as a traitorous red whose real purpose be the destruction of our government . 
this hysteria reach its height under the leadership of person . 
demagogue of this sort find communist bogey lurk behind any new idea that would run counter to stereotyped notion . 
new idea be dangerous and must be repress , no_matter_how . 
those who would suppress dangerous thought , credit idea with high potency . 
they give strict interpretation to william_james ' statement that `` every idea that enter the mind tend to express itself '' . 
they seem to believe that a person will act automatically as_soon_as he contact something new . 
hence , the only defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion , unless it give evidence that it be perfectly safe . 
despite this danger , however , we are inform on every hand that idea , not machine , be our fine tool ; they be priceless even_though they cannot be record on a ledger page ; they be the most valuable of commodity - and the most salable , for their demand far exceed supply . 
so all-important be idea , we are tell , that person successful in business and happy in social life usually fall_into two class : those who invent new idea of their own , and those who borrow , beg , or steal from others . 
seemingly , with an unrestricted flow of idea , all will be well , and we are even assure that `` an idea a day will keep_away the sheriff away '' . 
that , however , may also bring the police , if the thinking does not meet with social approval . 
criminal , as_well_as model citizen , exercise their mind . 
merely have a mental_image of some sort be not the all-important consideration . 
of_course , there must be clarity : a single distinct impression be more valuable than many fuzzy ones . 
but clarity be not enough . 
the writer take a class of college_student to the state hospital for the mentally_ill in location , missouri . 
an inmate , a former university professor , expound to us , logically and clearly , that someone was pilfer his thought . 
he appeal_to us to bring his case to the attention of the authority that justice might be do_justice . 
despite the clarity of his presentation , his idea be not of einsteinian calibre . 
true , idea be important , perhaps life 's most precious treasure . 
but have we not go overboard in stress their significance ? 
have we not actually develop idea worship ? 
idea we must have , and we seek them everywhere . 
we scour literature for them ; here we find store the wisdom of great mind . 
but be all these work worthy of consideration ? 
can they stand rigid scrutiny ? 
shakespeare 's wit and wisdom , his profound insight into human nature , have stand the test of century . 
but be he infallible in all thing ? 
what of his treatment of the jew in the_merchant_of_venice ? 
shakespeare give us a vivid picture of person , but probably he never see a jew , unless in some of his travel . 
the jew had been banish from england in 1290 and were not permit to return before 1655 , when shakespeare had be dead for thirty-nine year . 
if any had escape expulsion by hide , they certainly would not frequent the marketplace . 
shakespeare did not usually invent the incident in his play , but borrow them from old story , ballad , and play , weave them together , and then breathe into them his spark of life . 
rather than from a firsthand study of jewish people , his delineation of person stem from a collection of italian story , il_pecorone , publish in 1558 , although write almost two century earlier . 
he could learn at second_hand from book , but could not thus capture the real jewish spirit . 
person , in shaking_the_dust_from_shakespeare ( 216 ) , write : `` there is not a word speak by person which one would expect from a real jew '' . 
he take the story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone . 
the jew be the safe victim . 
no jew be on_hand to boycott his financially struggling theater . 
it would have be unwise policy , for_instance , to apply the pound of flesh characterization to the thrifty scotchman . 
just as now anyone may hurl insult at a citizen of mars , or even of location , and no senatorial investigation will result . 
who care about them ! 
shakespeare does not tell us that person be an aberrant individual . 
he set_forth him forth as be typical of the group . 
he tell of his `` jewish heart '' - not a shylockian heart ; but a jewish heart . 
this would make anyone crafty and cruel , capable of fiendish revenge . 
there be no justification for such misrepresentation . 
if living jew be unavailable for study , the bible be at_hand . 
read the old_testament would have show the dramatist that the idea attribute to person be abhorrent to the jew . 
be we better_off for have shakespeare 's idea of person ? 
study the_merchant_of_venice in high_school and college has give many young people their notion about jew . 
does this help the non-jew to understand this group ? 
person , inquisitor-general of the group , put_to_death many person to death . 
his name become synonymous with cold-blooded cruelty . 
would we gain by keep alive his memory and besmirch today 's roman_catholic by say he have a catholic heart ? 
let his bone and his memory rest in the fifteenth century where they belong ; he be out_of_place in our times . 
shakespeare 's person , too , be of dubious value in the modern_world . 
idea , in and of themselves , be not necessarily the greatest good . 
a successful businessman recently preface his address to a luncheon group with the statement that all economist should be send to the hospital for the mentally deranged where they and their theory might rot together . 
will his words come to be treasure and quote through the year ? 
frequently we are give assurance that automatically all idea will be sift and resift and in_the_end only the good ones will survive . 
but be that not like go_to a chemistry_laboratory and blindly pour_out liquid and powder from an array of bottle and then , after stir , expect a new wonder_drug inevitably to result ? 
what of the efficiency of this natural instrument of free discussion ? 
be there some magic in it that assure result ? 
when person ( pride_of_palomar , 43 ) inform us in 1921 that we have an instinctive dislike for the japanese , did the heated debate of the californian settle the truth or falsity of the proposition ? 
the leopard 's_spots come from the pen of person in 1902 , and in_this he announce an `` unchangeable '' law . 
if a child have a single drop of negro blood , he would revert to the ancestral line which , except as slave under a superior race , had not make one step of progress in 3000 year . 
that doctrine has been accept by many , but has it produce good result ? 
in the same vein , a certain short_story plot has been overwork . 
the son and heir of a prominent family marry a girl who have telltale shadow on the half-moon of her fingernail . 
in_time she present her aristocratic husband with a coal-black child . 
be the world better for having this idea thrust upon it ? 
will argument and debate decide its truth or falsity ? 
for answer to such question we must turn_to the anthropologist , the biologist , the historian , the psychologist , and the sociologist . 
long_ago they consign the notion of person and person to the scrapheap . 
false idea surfeit another sector of our life . 
for several generation much fiction has appear deal with the steprelationship . 
the stepmother , almost without exception , has been present as a cruel ogress . 
child , condition by this mistaken notion , have fear stepmother , while adult , by their antagonistic attitude , have make the role of the substitute parent a difficult one . 
debate be not likely to resolve the tension and make the lot of the stepchild a happy one . 
research , on_the_other_hand , has show many stepmother to be eminently successful , some far better than the real mother . 
person inform us ( the_psychology_of_women , vol. 2 , , 434 ) that in all culture `` the term ' stepmother ' automatically evoke deprecatory implication '' , a conclusion accept by many . 
will mere debate on that proposition , even_though it be free and untrammeled , remove the dross and leave a residue of refined gold ? 
that be questionable , to say the least . 
research into several culture has prove her position to be a mistaken one . 
most assuredly idea be invaluable . 
but idea , just for the sake of have them , be not enough . 
in the 1930 's , cure for the depression literally flood washington . 
for a time the president receive hundred of them every_day , most_of them worthless . 
idea need to be test , and not merely by argument and debate . 
when some question arise in the medical field concern cancer , for_instance , we do not turn_to free and open discussion as in a political_campaign . 
we have recourse to the scientifically trained specialist in the laboratory . 
the merit of the person anti polio vaccine were not establish on the forensic platform or in newspaper editorial , but in the laboratory and by test in the field on thousand of child . 
our presidential campaign provide much debate and argument . 
but be the result new barnful of tested knowledge on the basis of which we can with_confidence solve our domestic and international problem ? 
man , we are tell , be endowed with reason and be capable of distinguish good from bad . 
but what a super herculean task it be to winnow anything of value from the mud-beplastered argument use so freely , particularly since such common use is make of cliche and stereotype , in themselves declaration of intellectual bankruptcy . 
we are remind , however , that freedom_of_thought and discussion , the unfettered exchange of idea , be basic under our form_of_government . 
assuredly in our political_campaign there be freedom to think , to examine any and all issue , and to speak without restraint . 
no_holds_are_barred . 
but have the result be heartening ? 
may we state with_confidence that in such an exhibition a republic will find its greatest security ? 
we must_not forget , to_be_sure , that free discussion and debate have produce beneficial result . 
in_truth , we can say that this break the power of person , who was finally expose in full light to the american people . 
if he had been `` liquidate '' in_some_way , he would have become a martyr , a rallying_point for people who share his idea . 
debate in the political_arena can be productive of good . 
but it be a clumsy and wasteful process : it can produce negative result but not much that be positive . 
debate rid us of person but did not give us much that be positive . 
it do something to clear the ground , but it erect no striking new structure ; it did not even provide the architect 's plan for anything new . 
in the field of the natural_science , scientifically verify data be quite readily available and any discussion can be shorten with good result . 
in the field of the social_science a considerable fund of tested knowledge has been accumulate that can be use to good advantage . 
by_no_means would we discourage the production of idea : they provide raw_material with which to work ; they provide stimulation that lead to further production . 
we would establish no censorship . 
important as be person 's essay , his thesis be so restricting as to deny person the stature which he obviously have . 
he and also person and person have fall to the temptation which beset many_of us to read into our author - person , for_example , and herman_melville - protest against modernism , material progress , and science which be genuine protest of our own but may not have be theirs . 
person 's total work today , and in_fact those of his work which exist in 1946 when person made his comment , or in 1939 , when person write his essay , reveal no such simple attitude toward the south . 
if he be a traditionalist , he be an eclectic traditionalist . 
if he condemn the recent or the present , he condemn the past with no less force . 
if he see the heroic in a person or a person , he see also - and he show - the blind and the mean , and he see the person family disintegrate from within . 
if the barnburner 's family produce a person , who personify commercialism and materialism in hyperbolic crassness , the person family produce a person 4 , . 
person be a most untraditional traditionalist . 
others write_on person have find the phrase `` traditional moralist '' either inadequate or misleading . 
among them be person , person , and person . 
they have indicate the direction but they have not be explicit enough , i believe , in point_out person 's independence , his question if not indeed challenge the southern tradition . 
person 's be not the mind of the apologist which person imply that it be . 
he be not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social , cultural , or literary tradition than he be within the tradition - or possibly the regulation - govern his tenure in the post_office at location , mississippi , thirty-five year ago . 
that be not to deny that he has be aware of tradition , of_course , that he is steep in them , in_fact , or that he has deal with them , in his book . 
it be to say rather , i believe , that he has bring_to_bear on the history , the tradition , and the lore of his region a critical , skeptical mind - the same mind which has make of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique . 
he has employ from his section rich immediate material which in a loose sense can be term southern . 
the fact that he has cast over those material the light of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less southern , i rather think , for the south has be no_more solid than other region except in the political and related area where patronage and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity . 
some of us might be inclined to argue , in_fact , that an independence of mind and action and an intolerance of regimentation , either mental or physical , be particularly southern trait . 
there be no necessity , i suppose , to assert that person be southern . 
it would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly southern pedigree than that of his family . 
and , after_all , he has live comfortably at both location , mississippi , and location , virginia . 
the young person in new_orleans in the 1920 's impress the novelist person as obviously conscious of be a southerner , and there be no evidence that since then he has ever consider himself any less so . 
besides show no inclination , apparently , to absent himself from his native region even for short period , and in_addition write a shelf of book set in the region , he has handle in those book an astonishingly complete list of matter which have be important in the south during the past hundred year . 
it be more difficult with person than with most author to say what be the extent and what be the source of his knowledge . 
his own testimony be that he has read very little in the history of the south , imply that what he know of that history has come to him orally and that he know the world around him primarily from his own unassisted observation . 
his denial of extensive reading notwithstanding , it be no_doubt safe to assume that he has spend time school himself in southern history and that he has gain some acquaintance with the chief literary author who have live in the south or have write_about the south . 
to believe otherwise would be unrealistic . 
but in look_at person against his background in mississippi and the south , it be important not to lose the broad perspective . 
his earliest work reflect heavy influence from english and continental writer . 
evidence be plentiful that early and later also he has be indebted to the gothic_romancer , who deal in extravagant horror , to the symbolist write at the end of the preceding century , and in_particular to the stream_of_consciousness novelist , henry_james and person among them . 
his repeated experimentation with the technique of fiction testify to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also show him touch at many point the stream of literary development back of him . 
my intention , therefore , be not to say that person 's awareness has been confine within the border of the south , but rather that he has look_at his world as a southerner and that presumably his outlook be southern . 
the ingredient of person 's novel and story be by_no_means new with him , and most_of the problem he take_up have have the attention of author before him . 
a useful comment on his relation to his region may be make , i think , by note briefly how in handle southern material and southern problem he has deviate from the pattern set by other southern author while remain faithful to the essential character of the region . 
the planter aristocracy has appear in literature at_least since person publish swallow-barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of person preside over his plantation dominion initiate the most persistent tradition of southern literature . 
the thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the civil_war when southern writer be eager to defend a way_of_life which had been destroy . 
as they look with_nostalgia to a society which had been sweep_away , they be probably no_more than half conscious that they painted_in_colors which had never exist . 
their book find no less willing reader outside than inside the south , even while memory of the war be still sharp . 
the tradition reach its apex , perhaps , in the work of person toward the end of the century , and reappear undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel so_red_the_rose , by person . 
although person be the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have person 's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society . 
the myth of the southern plantation has have only a tangential relation with actuality , as person show forty year ago , and i suspect it has have a far narrow acceptance as something real than has generally been suppose . 
person has find it useful , but he has employ it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook . 
without say or seem to say that in portray the person and the person family person 's chief concern be social criticism , we can say nevertheless that through those family he dramatize his comment on the planter dynasty as they have exist since the decade before the civil_war . 
it may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard , for the treatment in his book be far removed from even the genial irony of person , who be the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of planter society . 
person 's low-class character have but few counterpart in earlier southern novel deal with plantation life . 
they have an ancestry extend back , however , at_least to 1728 , when person describe the person he encounter in the back_country of virginia and north_carolina . 
the chief literary antecedent of the person clan appear in the realistic , humorous writing which originate_in the south and the southwest in the three decade before the civil_war . 
these narrative of coarse action and crude language appear first in local newspaper , as a rule , and later find their way between book cover , though rarely into the planter ' library beside the morocco bound volume of person , person , person , and person . 
there be evidence to suggest , in_fact , that many author of the humorous sketch were prompt to write them - or to make them as indelicate as they be - by way of protest against the artificial refinement which had come to dominate the polite letters of the south . 
person , sturdy realist that he be , plead for a natural robustness such_as he find in his favorite the great elizabethan , to vivify the pale writing being produce around him . 
person admire the raucous tale emanate from the backwoods , but he have himself social affiliation which would not allow him to approve them fully . 
person , a preacher and a college and university president in four southern state , publish the early of these backwoods sketch and in the character person , in the account of sharp horse_trading and eye gouge physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his character , he set an example follow by many after him . 
others who write_of low character and low life include person , creator of the person of arkansas and person , the person ; person , whose character person bear a close kinship to person in both his willingness to take_advantage cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carry_out his will ; and person , whose tennessee hillbilly character person perpetrate more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature . 
it would be profitable , i believe , to read these realistic humorist alongside person 's work , the thought be not that he necessarily read them and owe anything to them directly , but rather that they deal a_hundred year ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continue down to our time , to person 's time . 
such a comparison remind us that in employ low character in his work person is record actuality in the south and moreover is follow a long established literary precedent . 
such character , with their low existence and often low morality , produce humorous effect in his novel and tale , as they did in the writing of person and person and person , but it need not be add that he give them far subtle and more intricate function than they have in the earlier writer ; nor is there need to add that among them be some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his character . 
one of the early humorist already mention , person , can be use to illustrate another point where person touch authentic southern material and also earlier literary treatment of those material . 
person come to louisiana from the east as a young man prepare to find in the new country the setting of romantic adventure and idealized beauty . 
but person see also the hardship of pioneer existence , the cultural poverty of the frontier_settlement , and the slack morality which abound in the new region . 
as a consequence of the tension thus produce in his thought and feelings , he write on_the_one_hand sketch of idealized hunting trip and on_the_other_hand an anecdote of the village of location , arkansas , where no one had ever see a piano ; and he write also the masterpiece of frontier humor , `` the_big_bear_of_arkansas '' , in which earthy realism is place alongside the exaggeration of the backwoods tall_tale and the awe with which man contemplate the grandeur and the mystery of nature . 
person 's feeling_of_identity with person was crown by her discovery of the coincidence that person 's epitaph in the jewish cemetery in venice refer to her as `` the sulamite '' . 
into the texture of this tapestry of history and human drama person , as every artist delight to do , weave strand of her own intuitive insight into human nature and - especially in the remarkable story of the attraction and conflict between two so disparate and fervent character as this pair - into the relations of man and woman : `` in their relations , she be the giver and he the receiver , nay the demander . 
his feeling always exact sacrifice from her . 
one be so accustomed to think_of man as the privileged who need but ask and receive , and woman as submissive and yielding , that our sympathy are usually enlist on the side of the man whose love is not return , and we condemn the woman as a coquette . 
the very firmness of her conviction and logical clearness of her argument captivate and stimulate him to make greater effort ; usually , this be most exasperating to man , who expect every woman to verify their preconceived_notion concern her sex , and when she does not , immediately condemn her as eccentric and unwomanly . 
she have the opportunity that few clever woman can resist , of show her superiority in argument over a man . 
woman themselves have come to look_upon matter in the same light as the outside world , and scarcely find any wrong in submit to the importunity of a strong will , even when their affection are withhold . 
she was expose herself to temptation which it be best to avoid where it can consistently be done . 
one who invite such trial of character be either foolhardy , overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith in mankind to see the danger . 
in any case but the last , such a course be sure to avenge itself upon the individual ; the moral power no more than the physical and mental , can bear overstrain . 
and , in the last case , a bitter disappointment but too often meet the confiding nature '' . 
person was discover in the process of write , as the born writer does , not merely a channel for the discharge of accumulate information but a stimulus to the development of the creative power of observation , insight and intuition . 
person be so pleased with the quality of her biographical study of person that he consider submit it to the century_magazine or harper 's but he decide that its jewish subject probably would not interest them and publish it in the_messenger , `` so our reader will be benefit instead '' . 
under her father 's influence it did not occur to person that she might write_on subject outside the jewish field , but she did begin write for other anglo-jewish paper and thus increase her output and her audience . 
and she write the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of person perform at the hanukkah festival which come in december . 
by her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing be so evident that papa and mamma give her a life_of_dickens as a spur to her aspiration . 
another source of intellectual stimulus was open to her at that time by the founding of group within walk distance of home . 
it was establish in a_couple_of building in the shopping district , with only a_few professor , but all eminent man , and a_few hundred eager student house in nearby dwelling . 
in september ' 76 person , darwin 's famous disciple , come from england to speak in a crowded auditorium at the formal opening of the university ; and although it be a school for man only , it afford person an opportunity to attend its public_lecture . 
in the following year her father undertake to give a course in hebrew theology to group student , and this bring to the person house a group of bright young jew who had come to baltimore to study , and who enjoy being feed and mother by mamma and entertain by person and person , who play and sing for them in the upstairs sitting_room on sunday evening . 
from philadelphia come person and person . 
person , person 's nephew , come to study assyriology . 
a smart , shrewd and ambitious young man , well connected , and with a knack for get in the good grace of important people , he be bound to go_far . 
person , the younger son of the distinguished rabbi , person , be a friendly , round-faced fellow with a little mustache , whose field be psychology , and who be also a punster and a jolly tease . 
his father be a good friend of person , and person live with the person for_a_while . 
both these youth , who greatly admire person , be somewhat young than she , as be also the neighboring person boy , who were then study medicine ; and bright though they all be , they could not possibly compete for her interest with papa , whose mind - although he never try to dazzle or patronize lesser light with it - naturally eclipse theirs and make them seem to her even young than they be . 
besides , person - as she be generally known since she had put up her hair with a chignon in the back - have little time to spare them from her teaching and writing ; so person become interested in her friend person , and person - the only young_man who when he write have the temerity to address her as person , and sign himself person - fall_in_love with pretty sister person . 
person , however , was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with person 's old and more serious brother , person , who be just_about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trip to philadelphia with papa , when he substitute for person at group there during its rabbi 's absence in europe . 
young person , who , while attend the group , also teach and edit a paper , find time to write person twenty page letter on everything that engage his interest , from the acting of person in philadelphia to his reaction to the comment of `` person '' on the jewish reform_movement being promulgate by the group in cincinnati . 
unlike his young brother , person , he never presume_to address her more familiarly than as `` my dear friend '' , although he praise and envy the elegance and purity of her style . 
and when he complain of the lack of time for all he wanted to do , person advise him to rise at five in the morning as she and papa did . 
one thing papa had not teach person was how to handle a young_man as high-spirited and opinionated as herself . 
she could not resist the opportunity `` of show her superiority in argument over a man '' which she had remark as one of the `` feminine folly '' of person ; and in her forthright way , person , who in her story of person had indicate her own unwillingness `` to think_of man as the privileged '' and `` woman as submissive and yielding '' , feel obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which person take_exception the slightest exception - he object to her stand on the person affair , as_well_as on the radical reform of person of group - until once , in sheer desperation , he write that he had give_up hope they would ever agree on anything . 
but that did not prevent him from write more long letter , or from come to spend his christmas vacation with the hospitable , lively person in their pleasant house on location . 
`` we 've have_got father and mother and each_other , '' say person on the first page of person 's little_women ; and , `` i do think that family be the most beautiful thing in all the world '' , burst_out person some five_hundred page later in that popular story of the person family , which had first appear when person be eight ; and the person family , as it develop , bear a striking resemblance to the person . 
person , like person , be a clergyman , although of an indeterminate denomination ; and `` marmee '' person , like person , be the competent manager of her brood of girl , of whom the person have only four to the person ' five . 
but the person girl have their counterpart in the person girl . 
person could easily identify herself with person , although person be not the eldest sister . 
neither be person hoydenish like person , who frankly wish she be a boy and had deliberately shorten her name , which , like person 's , be the feminine form of a boy 's name . 
but both be high-spirited and vivacious , both have temper to control , both love language , especially english and german , both be good teacher and write for publication . 
each be her mother 's assistant and confidante ; and each stand_out conspicuously in the family picture . 
person be more like person , the eldest person girl , who `` learn that a woman 's happy kingdom be home , her highest honor the art of rule it , not as a queen , but a wise wife and mother '' . 
person , blue-eyed like mamma , be from the start her mother's_daughter 's daughter , destine for her mother 's role in life . 
person , like person , suffer ill_health - get rheumatic_fever and had to be careful of her heart - but that never dampen her spirit . 
when her right_hand was incapacitate by the rheumatism , person learn to write with her left_hand . 
she write gay play about the girl for family entertainment , like `` oh_,_what_fun ! 
a comedy in three act '' , in which , under `` personage '' , person appear as `` a schoolmarm '' , and person , who be only a_trifle less brilliant in high_school than person had be , appear as `` person '' . 
person study piano ; play chopin in the `` soiree_musicale of person 's pupil '' ; and she recite `` hector 's_farewell_to_andromache '' most movingly , to the special delight of person at his home in location near philadelphia , where the person girl take_turns visit between the visit of the person boy at the person ' in baltimore . 
person , like person , the young of the person , be the rebellious , mischievous , rather calculating and ambitious one . 
for person , concede to be the pretty of the person girl - and she did make a pretty picture sit in the grape_arbor strum her guitar and sing in her silvery tone - there be no particular person counterpart ; but both group be so closely_knit that despite individual difference the family life in both case be remarkably similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content - the one be definitely jewish and the other vaguely christian . 
the person , like the person , enjoy and love live together , even in troubled times ; and , as in the person home , any young_man who call on the person find himself confront with a phalanx of femininity which make it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them . 
this include mamma , jolly , generous , and pretty , with whom they all fall_in_love , just as papa had first fall_in_love with her mamma before he choose her ; and when a young_man like person had enjoy the person hospitality , he feel obliged to send his respects and his gift not merely to person , in whom he be really interested , but to all the person girl and mamma . 
and just as `` person '' person was first attract to bright person , who find him immature by her high standard , and_then had to content himself with her younger sister person , so person , who had also been write person before he come to group , had_to content himself with her younger sister , pretty person . 
and like person , who see her sister person and person involved in `` lovering '' before herself , person see her sister person and person draw outside their family circle by the attraction of suitor , person by person , and person by person , a young businessman who would write her romantic description of his trip by steamboat down the mississippi . 
when person return to california in the winter of 1944 , it was to take_up again a collaboration with person , begin some year before . 
the film they do after his return be an inconsequential bit of nothing titled out_of_this_world , a satire on the person bobbysoxer craze . 
the twist lie in use person 's voice on the soundtrack while leading_man person mouth the words . 
if nothing else , at_least two good song come_out of the project , `` out_of_this_world '' and `` june_comes_around_every_year '' . 
though they would produce some very memorable and lasting song , person and person were not give strong material to work_on . 
their first collaboration come close . 
early in 1941 they were assign to a script titled hot_nocturne . 
it purport to be a reasonably serious attempt at a treatment of jazz_musician , their aim , their problem - the tug-of-war between the `` pure '' and the `` commercial '' - and seem a promising vehicle , for the two man share a common interest in jazz . 
person practically grow_up with the sound of jazz and the blues in his ear . 
he be_born in savannah , georgia , in 1909 . 
his father , person , was descend from an honored southern family that could trace its ancestry back to one person , who had emigrate from scotland in 1747 . 
the lyricist 's father be a lawyer who had branch_out into real_estate . 
his second wife , person , be the mother of person . 
by the age of six young person indicate that he had the call . 
one day he follow the_irish_jasper_greens , the town band , to a picnic and spend the entire day listen , while his family spend the day look . 
the disappearance cause his family to assign a full-time maid to keep_an_eye_on the boy . 
but one afternoon person meet her ; both be obviously on_the_way to the person home . 
the mother inquire , `` where 's person , and why did you leave him '' ? 
`` there be nothing else i could do '' , the maid answer , satisfied with a rather vague explanation . 
but person demand more . 
the maid then tell her , `` because he fire me '' . 
with her son evidence so strong a musical bent his mother could do little else but get him start on the study of music - though she wait until he be ten - begin with the piano and follow that with the trumpet . 
young person show a remarkable lack of aptitude for both instrument . 
still , he did like music making and even sing in the chapel choir of the group , near location , virginia , where he sound fine but did not matriculate too well . 
when he be fifteen person turn_out his first song , a jazzy little thing he call `` sister_susie , strut_your_stuff '' . 
if his scholarship and formal musicianship be not all they might have be , person demonstrate at an early age that he was gift with a remarkable ear for rhythm and dialect . 
from his playmate in location , person had pick_up , along with a soft southern dialect , trace also of the location dialect of africa . 
such speech difference make him acutely aware of the richness and expressiveness of language . 
during the summer , while he be still in school , person work for his father 's firm as a messenger_boy . 
it generally take well into the autumn for the firm to recover from the summer 's help . 
`` we 'd give him thing to deliver , letter , check , deed and thing like that '' , remember his half-brother person , still in the real_estate business in savannah , `` and learn day later that he 'd absentmindedly stuff them into his pocket . 
there they stay '' . 
this rather detached attitude toward life 's encumbrance has seem to be the dominant trait in person 's personality ever since . 
it be , however , a disarming disguise , or perhaps a shield , for not_only has person prove himself to be one of the few great lyricist over the year , but also one who can function remarkably under pressure . 
he has also enjoy a successful career as an entertainer ( his record have sell in the million ) and be a sharp businessman . 
he have also an extraordinary conscience . 
in 1927 his father 's business collapse , and , rather_than go bankrupt , person senior turn_over his firm over to a bank for liquidation . 
he die before he could completely pay_off his debt . 
some year later the bank handle the person liquidation receive a check for $ 300000 , enough to clear_up the debt . 
the check had been mail from chicago , the envelope bear no return_address , and the check be not signed . 
`` that 's person '' , sigh the bank president , `` the best hearted boy in the world , but absentminded '' . 
but person 's explanation be simple : `` i make_out the check and carry it around a_few day unsigned - in_case i lose it '' . 
when he remember that he might have not sign the check , person make_out another for the same amount , instruct the bank to destroy the other - especially if he had happened_to have absentmindedly sign both of them . 
when the family business fail , mercer leave school and on his mother 's urging - for she hope that he would become an actor - he join a local little theater group . 
when the troupe travel_to new_york to participate in a one act play competition - and win - person , instead of return with the rest of the company in triumph , remain in new_york . 
he had talk_into one other member of the group to stay with him , but that friend had tire of not eat regularly and return to savannah . 
but person hang_on , live , after_a_fashion , in a greenwich_village fourth flight walk-up . 
`` the place have no sink or washbasin , only a bathtub '' , his mother discover when she visit him . 
`` person insist on cook a chicken dinner in my honor - he 's always be a good cook - and i 'll never forget him clean the chicken in the tub '' . 
a story , no_doubt apocryphal , for person himself deny it , have him sport a monocle in those village day . 
though merely clear glass , it be a distinctive trademark for an aspiring actor who hope to imprint himself upon the memory of producer . 
one day in a bar , so the legend go , someone put a beer stein with too much force on the monocle and break it . 
the innocent malfeasant , filled with that supreme sense of honor find in bar , insist upon replace the destroyed monocle - and did , over the protest of the former owner - with a square monocle . 
person is_supposed_to have refuse it with , `` anyone who wear a square monocle must be affected '' ! 
person , then assistant director for the garrick_gaieties , a group production , need a lyricist for a song he had write ; he just happened not to need any actor at the moment , however . 
for him person produce the lyric to `` out_of_breath_scared_to_death_of_you '' , introduce in that most successful of all the gaieties , by person . 
this 1930 edition also have song in it by person and person , by person and person , and by person . 
entrance into such stellar song write company encourage the burgeon songwriter to take a wife , person , a dancer in the gaieties . 
the person take_up residence in brooklyn , and person find a regular job in wall_street `` misplace stock and bond '' . 
when he hear that person was look_for singer to replace the rhythm_boys , person apply and get the job , `` not for my voice , i 'm sure , but because i could write song and material generally '' . 
while with the person band person meet person . 
he had yet to meet person , for although they had `` collaborate '' on `` satan 's li ' l lamb '' , person and person had work from a lead_sheet the composer had furnish them . 
the lyric , person remember , was tailor to fit the unusual melody . 
person 's person association bring him into contact with person , whose `` snowball '' person relyric as `` lazybones '' , in which form it become a hit and mark the real beginning of person 's song write career . 
after leave person , person join the person band as a vocalist . 
with the help of person , also in the band , he transform a traditional jewish melody into a popular song , `` and_the_angels_sing '' . 
the countrywide success of `` lazybones '' and `` and_the_angels_sing '' could only lead to hollywood , where , besides person , person collaborate with person , person , person , person , person , and person . 
person has also write both music and lyric for several song . 
he may be the only songwriter ever to have collaborate with a secretary of the group ; he collaborate on a song with person , who be secretary of the treasury , 1932 - 33 . 
when person and person begin their collaboration in 1940 , person , like person , have several substantial film song to his credit , among them `` hooray_for_hollywood '' , `` ride , tenderfoot , ride '' , `` have_you_got_any_castles , baby ? '' 
, and `` too_marvelous_for_words '' ( all with person ) ; with person he do `` the_girl_friend_of_the_whirling_dervish '' , `` jeepers creepers '' , and `` you_must_have_been_a_beautiful_baby '' . 
person 's lyric are characterize by an unerring ear for rhythmic nuance , a puckish sense_of_humor express in language with a colloquial flair . 
though versatile and capable of turn_out a ballad lyric with the best of them , person 's forte be a highly polished quasi folk wit . 
his casual , dreamlike work method , often as not in_absentia , be an abrupt change from person 's , so that person had_to adjust again to another approach to collaboration . 
there be time that he work with both lyricist simultaneously . 
speak of his work with person , person say , `` our work habit be strange . 
after we get a script and the spot for the song were block_out , we 'd get_together for an hour or_so every_day . 
while person make himself comfortable on the couch , i 'd play the tune for him . 
he have a wonderfully retentive memory . 
after i would finish play the song , he 'd just go_away without a comment . 
i would n't hear from him for a_couple_of week , then he 'd come around with the completed lyric '' . 
person be one of the few ( possibly the only ) composer person has be able to work with so closely , for they hold their meeting in person 's study . 
`` some guy bother me '' , person has say . 
`` i could n't write with them in the same room with me , but i could with person . 
he be probably our most original composer ; he often use very odd rhythm , which make it difficult , and challenging , for the lyric writer '' . 
while person and person collaborate on hot_nocturne , person work also with person on another film , navy_blues . 
person , too , work_on other project at_the_same_time with old friend person . 
besides do a single song , `` when_the_sun_comes_out '' , they work_on the ambitious americanegro_suite , for voice and piano , as_well_as song for film . 
the americanegro_suite be in_a_sense an extension of the cotton_club song in_that it be a collection of negro song , not for a nightclub , but for the concert stage . 
the work had its beginning in 1938 with an eight bar musical strain to which person set the words `` there 'll be no more work / there 'll be no more worry '' , match the spiritual feeling of the jot . 
this grow_into the song `` big_time_comin '' ' . 
by september 1940 the suite had develop into a collection of six song , `` four spiritual , a dream , and a lullaby '' . 
the negro composer person study the americanegro_suite and say of it , `` of all the many song write by white composer and employ what claim to be a negroid idiom in both words and music , these six song by person and person easily stand_out far out above the rest . 
thoroughly modern in treatment , they be at_the_same_time , full of simple sincerity which invariably characterize genuine negro folk_music and are by_no_means to be confuse with the average ' broadway spiritual ' which depend_upon for their racial flavor upon sundry allusion to the ' amen_corner ' , ' judgement_day ' , ' person 's horn ' , and a frustrated devil - with a_few random ' hallelujah ' throw_in for_good_measure . 
two facet of this aspect of the literary process have special significance for our time . 
one , a reservation on the point i have just make , be the phenomenon of pseudo thinking , pseudo feeling , and pseudo willing , which person discuss in the_escape_from_freedom . 
in_essence this involve ground one 's thought and emotion in the values and experience of others , rather_than in one 's own values and experience . 
there be a risk that instead of teach a person how to be himself , read fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else . 
clearly what the person bring to the reading be important . 
moreover , if the critic instruct his audience in what to see in a work , he is contribute to this pseudo think ; if he instruct them in how to evaluate a work , he is help them to achieve their own identity . 
the second timely part of_this sketch of literature and the search for identity have to do with the difference between good and enduring literary_work and the ephemeral mass_culture product of today . 
in the range and variety of character who , in their literary life , get_along all_right with life_style one never imagine possible , there be an implicit lesson in differentiation . 
the reader , observe this process , might ask `` why not be different '' ? and find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species . 
the observer of television or other product for a mass audience have only a permit to be , like the model he see , even more like everybody else . 
and this , i think , hold for values as_well as life_style . 
one would need_to test this proposition carefully ; after_all , the large ( and probably unreliable ) reader 's digest literature on the `` most unforgettable character i ever meet '' deal with village grocer , country_doctor , favorite if illiterate aunt , and_so_forth . 
scientist often turn_out to be idiosyncratic , too . 
but still , the proposition be worth examination . 
it be possible that the study of literature affect the conscience , the morality , the sensitivity to some code of `` right '' and `` wrong '' . 
i do not know that this be true ; both person and person deal with the development and nature of conscience , as do such theologian as person and person . 
it form the core of many , perhaps most , problem of psychotherapy . 
i be not aware of great attention by any of these author or by the psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary_study in the development of conscience - most_of their attention be to a preliterate period of life , or , for the theologian of_course , to the influence of religion . 
still , it would be surprising if what one read did not contribute to one 's idea of right and wrong ; certainly the awakened alarm over the comic_book and the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate some peripheral aspect of_this influence . 
probably the most important thing to focus_on be not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the content of conscience , the code which is impart to the developed or immature conscience available . 
this be in large part a code_of_behavior and a glossary of values : what be it that people do and should do and_how one should regard it . 
in a small way this is illustrate by the nineteenth century novelist who argue for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrate this with the way a girl learn to meet her lover , how to behave , how to think about this new experience , how to exercise restraint . 
literature may be say to give people a sense_of_purpose , dedication , mission , significance . 
this , no_doubt , be part of what person imply when he say of the arts , `` they give form and meaning to life which might otherwise seem shapeless and without sense '' . 
man seem almost universally to want a sense of function , that_is , a feeling that their existence make a difference to someone , living or unborn , close and immediate or generalized . 
feel useless seem generally to be an unpleasant sensation . 
a need so deeply planted , ask for direction , so_to_speak , be likely to be gratify by the vivid example and heroic proportion of literature . 
the term `` renewal '' and `` refreshed '' , which often come_up in aesthetic discussion , seem partly to derive their import from the `` renewal '' of purpose and a `` refreshed '' sense of significance a person may receive from poetry , drama , and fiction . 
the notion of `` inspiration '' be somehow cognate to this feeling . 
how literature do this , or for whom , be certainly not clear , but the content , form , and language of the `` message '' , as_well_as the source , would all play differentiated part in give and mold a sense_of_purpose . 
one of the most salient feature of literary value has been deem to be its influence upon and organization of emotion . 
let us differentiate a_few of these idea . 
the aristotelian notion of catharsis , the purging of emotion , be a persistent and viable one . 
the idea here be one of discharge but this must stand in opposition to a second view , plato 's notion of the arousal of emotion . 
a third idea be that artistic literature serve to reduce emotional conflict , give a sense of serenity and calm to individual . 
this is given some expression in person 's notion of harmony and the resolution of indecision . 
a fourth view be the transformation of emotion , as in person 's fine phrase on the arts : 
they `` transform and beautify our inner nature '' . 
it be possible that the idea of enrichment of emotion be a fifth idea . 
person , in his discussion of the `` functions_and_future_of_poetry '' , suggest this : 
`` one of the thing which make our life drab and empty and which leave us , at the end of the day , fatigued and deflated spiritually be the pressure of the taxing , practical , utilitarian concern of commonsense object . 
if art is to release us from these postulate thing [ thing we must think symbolically about ] and bring us back to the ineffable beauty and richness of the aesthetic component of reality in its immediacy , it must sever its connection with these commonsense entity '' . 
i take the central meaning here to be the contrast between the drab empty quality_of_life without literature and a life enrich by it . 
person ' view of the aesthetic experience might constitute a sixth variety : for him it constitute , in part , the organization of impulse . 
a sketch of the emotional value of the study of literature would have_to take_account of all_of these . 
but there be one in_particular which , it seem to me , deserve special attention . 
in the wide range of experience common to our earthbound race none be more difficult to manage , more troublesome , and more enduring in its effect than the control of love and hate . 
the study of literature contribute to this control in a curious way . 
person and person , it seem to me , have a penetrating insight into the way in_which this control is effect : `` for if we say poetry be to talk of beauty and love ( and yet not aim at excite erotic emotion or even an emotion of platonic esteem ) and if it be to talk of anger and murder ( and yet not aim at arouse anger and indignation ) - then it may be that the poetic way of deal with these emotion will not be any kind of intensification , compounding , or magnification , or any direct assault upon the affection at_all . 
something indirect , mixed , reconciling , tensional might well be the stratagem , the devious technique by which a poet indulge in all kind of talk about love and anger and even in something like '' expression `` of these emotion , without aim at their incitement or even utter anything that essentially involve their incitement '' . 
the rehearsal through literature of emotional life under controlled condition may be a most valuable human experience . 
here i do not mean catharsis , the discharge of emotion . 
i mean something more like person 's concept of the utility of `` play '' to a small child : he play `` house '' or `` doctor '' or `` fireman '' as a way of master slightly frightening experience , reliving them imaginatively until they be under control . 
there be a second feature of the influence of literature , good literature , on emotional life which may have some special value for our time . 
in person 's portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of london , a salient finding be the inability to postpone gratification , a need to satisfy impulse immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savor the experience . 
perhaps it be only an analogy , but one of the most obvious difference between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring quality be the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation . 
anyone who has watch child develop a taste for literature will understand what i mean . 
it be at_least possible that the capacity to postpone gratification is develop as_well_as express in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature . 
in any inquiry into the way in which great literature affect the emotion , particularly with_respect_to the sense of harmony , or relief of tension , or sense of `` a transformed inner nature '' which may occur , a most careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which produce the effect would be require . 
in the calm which follow the reading of a poem , for_example , be the effect produce by the enforced quiet , by the musical quality of words and rhythm , by the sentiment or sense of the poem , by the association with earlier reading , if it be familiar , by the boost to the self-esteem for the semiliterate , by the diversion of attention , by the sense of security in a legitimize withdrawal , by a kind license for some variety of fantasy_life regard_as forbidden , or by half conscious idea about the magical_power of words ? 
these be , if the research is do with subtlety and skill , researchable topic , but the research be missing . 
one of the most frequent view of the value of literature be the education of sensibility that it is think to provide . 
sensibility be a vague word , cover an area of meaning rather than any precise talent , quality , or skill . 
among_other_things it mean perception , discrimination , sensitivity to subtle difference . 
both the extent to which this be true and the limit of the field of perceptual skill involved should be acknowledge . 
its truth is illustrate by the skill , sensitivity , and general expertise of the english_professor with whom one attend the theatre . 
the limit are suggest by an imaginary experiment : contrast the perceptual skill of english_professor with that of their colleague in discriminate among motorcar , political candidate , or female beauty . 
along these line , the particular point that sensitivity in literature lead to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than i have see . 
in a symposium and general exploration of the field of person perception and interpersonal behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject , with one possible exception ; person show the transcultural stability of metaphor base on sensation ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc . ) deal with personal quality of human_being and event . 
but to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal difference be too great an inferential leap . 
i would say , too , that the study of literature tend to give a person what i shall call depth . 
i use this term to mean three thing : a search for the human significance of an event or state_of_affairs , a tendency to look_at whole rather_than part , and a tendency to respond to these event and whole with feeling . 
it be the obverse of triviality , shallowness , emotional anaesthesia . 
i think these attribute cluster , but i have no evidence . 
in_fact , i can only say this seem to me to follow from a wide , continuous , and properly guided exposure to literary art . 
the late person , a philosopher whose work has prove helpful to many student of literature , once write `` we be all , though many_of us be snobbish enough to wish to deny it , in far close sympathy with the art of the music_hall and picture_palace than with person and person , or even shakespeare and person . 
by an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our mind back into the art of a remote past or an alien present , and enjoy the carving of caveman and japanese colour print ; but the possibility of this effort be bound_up with that development of historical thought which be the greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two century , and it be utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not take_place . 
the natural and primary aesthetic attitude be to enjoy contemporary art , to despise and dislike the art of the recent past , and wholly to ignore everything else '' . 
one might argue that the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship be to correct this spontaneous provincialism that be likely to obscure the horizon of the general public , of the newspaper_critic , and of the creative artist himself . 
there result a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the contemporary . 
such study may take many form . 
the study of idea in literature be one of these . 
of_course , it goes_without_saying that no student of idea can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene . 
he will frequently return to it . 
the continuity , contrast , and similarity discernible when past and present are survey together be inexhaustible and the one is often understand through the other . 
when we assert the value of such study , we find ourselves commit to an important assumption . 
most student of literature , whether they call themselves scholar or critic , be ready to argue that it be possible to understand literary_work as_well_as to enjoy them . 
many will add that we may find our enjoyment heighten by our understanding . 
this understanding , of_course , may in_its_turn take many form and some of these - especially those most interesting to the student of comparative_literature - be essentially historical . 
but the historian of literature need not confine his attention to biography or to stylistic question of form , `` texture '' , or technique . 
he may also consider idea . 
it be true that this distinction between style and idea often approach the arbitrary since in_the_end we must admit that style and content frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes appear as expression of the same insight . 
but , in_general , we may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention toward one or the other . 
at this point a working definition of idea be in_order , although our first definition will have to be qualify somewhat as we proceed . 
the term idea refer to our more reflective or thoughtful consciousness as_opposed_to the immediacy of sensuous or emotional experience . 
it is through such reflection that literature approach philosophy . 
an idea , let us say , may be roughly define as a theme or topic with which our reflection may be concerned . 
in this essay , we be , along with most historian , interested in the more general or more inclusive idea , that be so_to_speak `` writ_large '' in history of literature where they recur continually . 
outstanding among these be the idea of human nature itself , include the many definition that have been advance over the century ; also secondary notion such_as the perfectibility of man , the depravity of man , and the dignity of man . 
one might , indeed , argue that the history of idea , in_so_far as it include the literature , must center_on characterization of human nature and that the great period of literary achievement may be distinguish from one another by reference to the image of human nature that they succeed in fashion . 
we need not , to_be_sure , expect to find such idea in every piece of literature . 
an idea , of the sort that we have_in_mind , although of_necessity readily available to imagination , be more general in connotation than most poetic or literary image , especially those appear in lyric_poem that seek to capture a moment of personal experience . 
thus person 's `` my love be like a red , red rose '' and person ' `` the thunder-purple sea beach , plumed purple of thunder '' although clearly intelligible in content , hardly present idea of the sort with which we are here concern . 
on_the_other_hand , person 's `` the unplumbed , salt , estranging sea '' , take in its context , certainly does so . 
understand a work_of_art involve recognition of the idea that it reflect or embody . 
thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify a poem or an essay as be in idea or in ideal content or subject_matter typical or atypical of its period . 
again , he may discover embodied within its texture a theme or idea that has been present elsewhere and at other time in various way . 
our understanding will very probably require both these commentary . 
very likely it will also include a recognition that the work we are read reflect or `` belong_to '' some way of thought label as a `` school '' or an `` - ism '' , i.e. a complex or `` syndrome '' of idea occur together with sufficient prominence to warrant identification . 
thus idea like `` grace '' , `` salvation '' , and `` providence '' cluster together in traditional christianity . 
usually the work study offer us a special or even an individualized rendering or treatment of the idea in_question , so that the student find it necessary to distinguish carefully between the several expression of an `` - ism '' or mode of thought . 
accordingly we may speak_of the platonism peculiar to person 's poem or the type of stoicism present in person 's `` invictus '' , and we may find that describe such platonism or such stoicism and contrast each with other expression of the same attitude or mode of thought be a difficult and challenging enterprise . 
after_all , person be no `` orthodox '' or hellenic platonist , and even his `` romantic '' platonism can be distinguish from that of his contemporaries . 
again , person 's attitude of defiance which color his ideal of self mastery be far from characteristic of a stoic thinker like person , whose gentle acquiescence be almost christian , comparable_to the patience express in person 's sonnet on his own blindness . 
in recent year , we have come increasingly to recognize that idea have a history and that not the least important chapter of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspect of literature and the art , although these aspect should be study in_conjunction_with the history of philosophy , of religion , and of the science . 
when these field are survey together , important pattern of relationship emerge indicate a vast community of reciprocal influence , a continuity of thought and expression include many tradition , primarily literary , religious , and philosophical , but frequently include contact with the fine_arts and even , to some extent , with science . 
here we may observe that at_least one modern philosophy of history is build on the assumption that idea be the primary objective of the historian 's research . 
let us quote once_more from person : `` history is properly concern with the action of human_being . 
regard from the outside , an action be an event or series of event occur in the physical world ; regard from the inside , it be the carrying_into_action of a certain thought . 
the historian 's business be to penetrate to the inside of the action with which he is deal and reconstruct or rather rethink the thought which constitute them . 
it be a characteristic of thought that , in rethink them we come , ipso_facto , to understand why they were think '' . 
such an understanding , although it must seek to be sympathetic , be not a matter of intuition . 
`` history have this in_common with every other science : that the historian be not allow to claim any single piece of knowledge , except where he can justify his claim by exhibit to himself in_the_first_place , and secondly to any one else who be both able and willing to follow his demonstration , the grounds upon which it is base . 
this be what was mean , above , by describe history as inferential . 
the knowledge in_virtue_of_which a man be an historian be a knowledge of what the evidence at his disposal prove about certain event '' . 
it is obvious that the historian who seek to recapture the idea that have motivate human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concern , by_no_means a mere supplement or adjunct of significant historical research . 
the student of idea and their place in history will always be concerned with the pattern of transition , which be at_the_same_time pattern of transformation , whereby idea pass from one area of activity to another . 
let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought - turn our attention from the reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movement that follow and dwell_on finally on more recent decade . 
we may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious practice and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the art . 
finally we may note that the idea appear in educational theory where its influence be at_present widespread . 
no one will deny that such broad development and transition be of great intrinsic interest and the study of idea in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference to them . 
still , we must remember that we cannot construct and justify generalization of this sort unless we be ready to consider many special instance of influence move between such_as area as theology , philosophy , political thought , and literature . 
the actual moment of contact be vitally important . 
these moment be historical event in the life of individual author with which the student of comparative_literature must be frequently concern . 
perhaps the most powerful and most frequently recur literary influence on the western world has be that of the old_testament and new_testament . 
certainly one of the most important comment that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural life of any period of western civilization during the past sixteen or seventeen century have to do with the way in which its leaders have read and interpret the bible . 
this reading and the comment that it evoke constitute the influence . 
a contrast of the scripture reading of , let us say , person , person , and person , all three of whom find in such study a real source of enlightenment , can tell us a great_deal about these three man and the age that each represent and help bring to conscious expression . 
in much the same way , we recognize the importance of shakespeare 's familiarity with person and person , of person 's study of plato 's dialogue , and of coleridge 's enthusiastic plundering of the writing of many philosopher and theologian from plato to person and person , through which so many abstract idea were bring to the attention of english man_of_letters . 
we may also recognize case in which the poet have influence the philosopher and even indirectly the scientist . 
english philosopher person 's debt to wordsworth and person be a recent interesting example , as also person 's understanding of the english romantic , chiefly person and wordsworth . 
hegel 's profound admiration for the insight of the greek tragedian indicate a broad channel of classical influence upon nineteenth century philosophy . 
again the student of evolutionary biology will find a fascinating , if to our mind grotesque , anticipation of the theory of chance variation and the natural elimination of the unfit in person , who in_turn seem to have borrow the concept from the philosopher person . 
here an important caveat be in_order . 
we must avoid the notion , suggest to some people by example such_as those just mention , that idea be `` unit '' in_some_way comparable_to coin or counter that can be pass intact from one group of people to another or even , for_that_matter , from one individual to another .

the relative effectiveness of voluntary versus mandatory report of accident statistic ; 
the relative contribution to safety of inspection program embody - 
right_of_entry only and right_of_entry plus enforcement authority ;

the secretary_of_the_interior or any duly authorized representative shall be entitle to admission to , and to require report from the operator of , any metal or nonmetallic mine which be in a state ( exclude any coal or lignite mine ) , the product of_which regularly enter commerce or the operation of_which substantially affect commerce , for the purpose of gather datum and information necessary for the study authorize in the first section of_this act . 
as use in_this section - 
the term `` state '' include the commonwealth of puerto_rico and any possession of the united_states ; and the term `` commerce '' mean commerce between any state and any place outside thereof , or between point within the same state but through any place outside thereof . 
the secretary_of_the_interior shall submit a report of his finding , together with recommendation for an effective safety program for metal and nonmetallic mine ( exclude coal and lignite mine ) base upon such finding , to the congress not more_than two year after the date of enactment of_this act . 
approve september 26 , 1961 . 
be it enact by the senate and house_of_representatives of the united_states_of_america in congress assemble , that the secretary_of_the_interior is hereby authorize and direct to establish and maintain a program of stabilization payment to small domestic producer of lead and zinc ore and concentrate in_order to stabilize the mining of lead and zinc by small domestic producer on public , indian , and other land as provide in_this act . 
subject_to the limitation of_this act , the secretary_of_the_interior shall make stabilization payment to small domestic producer upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to him of their status as such producer and of the sale by them of newly mine ore , or concentrate produce therefrom , as provide in_this act . 
payment shall be make only with_respect_to the metal content as determine by assay . 
such payment shall be make to small domestic producer of lead as_long_as the market_price for common lead at new_york , new_york , as determine by the secretary_of_the_interior , be below 14 - 1 2 cent per pound , and such payment shall be 75 per centum of the difference between 14 - 1 2 cent per pound and the average market_price for the month in_which the sale occur as determine by the secretary_of_the_interior . 
such payment shall be make to small domestic producer of zinc as_long_as the market_price for prime western zinc at location , illinois , as determine by the secretary_of_the_interior , be below 14 - 1 2 cent per pound , and such payment shall be 55 per centum of the difference between 14 - 1 2 cent per pound and the average market_price for the month in_which the sale occur as determine by the secretary_of_the_interior . 
the maximum amount of payment which may be make pursuant to this act on_account_of sale of newly mine ore or concentrate produce therefrom make during the calendar_year 1962 shall not exceed $ 4500000 ; the maximum amount of such payment which may be made on_account_of such sale make during the calendar_year 1963 shall not exceed $ 4500000 ; the maximum amount of such payment which may be make on_account_of such sale make during the calendar_year 1964 shall not exceed $ 4000000 ; and the maximum amount of such payment which may be make on_account_of such sale make during the calendar_year 1965 shall not exceed $ 3500000 . 
another recent achievement be the successful development of a method for the complete combustion in a bomb_calorimeter of a metal in fluorine when the product be relatively nonvolatile . 
this work give a heat_of_formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiate a value which had been determine by a less direct method , and raise this property to 15 percent above that accept a_few year ago . 
similar measurement are being initiate to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat_of_formation of another important combustion product , beryllium fluoride . 
the development and testing of new apparatus to measure other property is near completion . 
in one of these , an explode wire device to study system thermodynamically up_to 6000 * * f and 100 atmosphere pressure , a major goal was achieve . 
the accuracy of measure the total electrical energy enter an explode wire during a_few microsecond was verify when two independent type of comparison with the heat_energy produce have an uncertainty of less_than 2 percent . 
this agreement is consider very good for such short time interval . 
the method of calibration employ a fixed resistance element as a calorimeter . 
the element is insert in the discharge circuit in_place_of the explode wire , and the calorimetric heating of the element is measure with high accuracy . 
this is use as a reference for compare the ohmic heating and the electrical energy obtain from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element . 
a high-speed shutter has been develop in_order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion . 
the shutter consist_of two part : a fast opening part and a fast closing part . 
use person 's method , the fast closing action is obtain from the blackening of a window by explode a series of parallel lead wire . 
the fast open of the shutter consist_of a piece of aluminum_foil ( approximately * * f ) place directly in_front of the camera_lens so that no light may pass into the camera . 
the opening action is obtain when a capacitor , charge to high voltage , is suddenly discharge through the foil . 
during the discharge the magnetic_force set_up by the passage of current cause the edge of the foil to roll inward toward its center_line , thus allow light to pass into the camera . 
experiment have show that the shutter be 75 percent open in about 60 - 80 microsecond . 
the shutter aperture may be make larger or smaller by change the foil area and adjust the electrical energy input to the foil . 
besides the well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm wavelength , the spectrum of extraterrestrial radio_source may contain sharp line characteristic of other atom , ion , and small molecule . 
the detection and study of such line spectrum would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas cloud and , perhaps , planetary atmosphere . 
among the most likely producer of detectable radio line spectrum be the light diatomic hydride oh and ch ; somewhat less likely source be the heavy hydride sh , sih , and sch . 
very small concentration of these hydride should be detectable ; in interstellar gas , concentration as low as * * f molecule / * * f may be sufficient , as compare to the * * f hydrogen_atom * * f require for detection of the 21 - cm line . 
high sensitivity in radio_telescope is achieve by reduce the bandwidth of the receiver ; therefore , only with precise foreknowledge of the line frequency be an astronomical search for the radio_spectrum of these molecule feasible . 
to secure precise measurement of these frequency , a research program in free_radical microwave spectroscopy has been start . 
since conventional method be insensitive at the low_frequency of these molecular transition , the paramagnetic resonance method is being use instead . 
this involve the application of a strong magnetic_field to the radical vapor , which shift the low_frequency spectrum to a conveniently high microwave range , where they may be measure with optimum sensitivity . 
the first diatomic hydride investigate by the paramagnetic resonance method be the oh radical . 
result of_this experiment include the frequency of the two strong spectral line by which oh may be identify in interstellar gas ; the frequency be 1665.32 and 1667.36 * * f , with an uncertainty of 0.10 * * f . 
success in observe these spectral line has so_far , apparently , been confine to the laboratory ; extraterrestrial observation have yet to be report . 
preparation are being make for similar experiment on ch and sh radical . 
the group is pursue an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration service in the range 15 to 20 * * f . 
the effort and accomplishment fall_into three main category : absolute thermometry base upon the velocity of sound in helium gas , secondary thermometry involve principally study of the behavior of germanium resistor , and helium 4 vapor_pressure measurement ( see p. 144 ) . 
an acoustical interferometer has been construct and use , with helium gas as the thermometric fluid , to measure temperature near 4.2 and 2.1 * * f . 
such an interferometer provide a means of absolute_temperature measurement , and may be use as_an_alternative to the gas_thermometer . 
when value of temperature derive with this instrument were compare with the accepted value associate with liquid helium 4 vapor_pressure , difference of about 10 and 7 millidegree respectively were find . 
this result be preliminary , and work is continue . 
carbon resistor and impurity doped germanium resistor have been investigate for use as precision secondary thermometer in the liquid helium temperature region . 
several germanium resistor have been thermally cycle from 300 to 4.2 * * f and their resistance have been find to be reproducible within 1 3 millidegree when temperature were derive from a vapor_pressure thermometer whose tubing is jacket through most_of the liquid helium . 
preliminary calibration of the resistor have been make from 4.21 to 2.16 * * f at every 0.1 * * f . 
the estimated standard_deviation of the datum for two of the resistor be 1 millidegree ; and for the third resistor , 3.3 millidegree . 
the reproducibility of helium vapor_pressure thermometer have been investigate in conjunction with a `` constant temperature '' liquid helium bath from 4.2 to 1.8 * * f . 
surface temperature_gradient have been find to exist in liquid helium bath contain in 15 - and 25 - liter metallic storage dewar . 
the gradient be about one-half of a millidegree at 4.2 * * f but increase to several millidegree for bath temperature slightly greater than the one l point . 
a hydrostatic_head correction has been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor_pressure or temperature for the bulk liquid helium . 
however , the surface temperature_gradient can produce erroneous vapor_pressure measurement for the bulk liquid helium unless precaution are take to isolate the tube ( which pass_through the surface to the vapor_pressure bulb ) from the liquid helium surface . 
it has also been observe , in helium 2 , , that large discrepancy can exist between surface vapor_pressure and those pressure measure by a vapor_pressure thermometer . 
this has been attribute to helium film flow in the vapor_pressure thermometer . 
in this case also the design of the thermometer can be modify to reduce the helium film flow . 
precise pressure volume temperature measurement on corrosive gas be dependent_on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer . 
a prototype which fulfill the requirement was develop and thoroughly test . 
the transducer be a null type instrument and employ a stretched diaphragm , 0.001 in thick and 1 in in diameter . 
a small pressure unbalance displace the diaphragm and change the capacitance between the diaphragm and an electrically insulate plate space 0.001 in apart ( for * * f ) . 
spherical concave backing surface support the diaphragm when excessive pressure are apply and prevent the stress within the diaphragm from exceed the elastic limit . 
over a temperature range from 25 to 200 * * f and at pressure up_to 250 atm , an overload of 300 psi , apply for a period of one day , result in an uncertainty in the pressure of , at_most , one millimeter_of_mercury . 
a 6 - year study of the transport property of air at elevated temperature has been complete . 
this project was carry_out under sponsorship of the group , group , and have as its goal the investigation of the transport by diffusion of the heat_energy of chemical binding . 
a significant effect discover during the study be the existence of person number reach value of more_than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region . 
another effect discover be the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tend to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature difference straddle the nitrogen dissociation region be present . 
the result of the study , base on collision integral compute from the latest critically evaluate data on intermolecular force in air , will be report in the form of a table of viscosity , thermal conductivity , thermal diffusion , and diffusion coefficient at temperature of 1000 to 10000 * * f and of logarithm of pressure in atmosphere from * * f to * * f times normal density . 
in march , 1961 , representative of the national laboratory of australia , canada , the_netherlands , united_kingdom , location , united_states , and location , meet at the group to devise means for reach international agreement on a temperature scale between 10 and 90 * * f . 
as a first_step toward this goal , arrangement were work_out for compare the scale now in_use through circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance_thermometer for calibration by each national laboratory . 
such a group of thermometer was obtain and calibrate at the group . 
these thermometer have now been send to the united_kingdom for calibration at the location . 
during the last week of march 1961 , columbus , ohio be the site of the group , group . 
the symposium , which was jointly sponsor by the american_institute_of_physics , the instrument_society_of_america , and the national_bureau_of_standards , attract nearly one_thousand registrant , include many from abroad . 
the group contribute to the planning and success of the symposium through the effort of person , person , and person , person . 
person , person , open the 5 - day session with introductory remark , following which a total of twenty-six paper were give throughout the week by group scientist , from both the washington and group . 
in_addition to the basic program in wavelength standard , spectroscopy , solid-state physics , interaction of the free electron and atomic constant which be necessary to provide the foundation for technological progress , the group has strengthen its activity in laboratory astrophysics . 
the program in infrared spectroscopy are undergo reorientation toward wavelength standard in the far infrared , the application of infrared technique to solid-state study , and increased emphasis on high resolution instrumentation . 
two data center have been establish for the collection , indexing , critical evaluation , and dissemination of bibliography and critical value in the field of transition probability and collision cross_section . 
under the sponsorship of the group and the group , a data center was establish to gather and index all published information on atomic transition probability . 
an exhaustive survey was make of the literature , and a primary reference file of approximately 600 reference was catalogue . 
selected bibliography and table of available data be now in preparation . 
a wall stabilized high current arc source was construct and use to study transition probability of atomic hydrogen and oxygen . 
this apparatus will also be use to measure transition probability of a large_number of other element . 
a study of the hydrogen line profile indicate that a measurement of these profile can be use to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that be reliable to about * * f percent . 
a set of table contain spectral intensity for 39000 line of 70 element , as observe in a copper matrix in a dc arc , was complete and publish . 
study of the intensity data indicate that they may be convert to approximate transition probability . 
these data be not of the precision obtainable by the method previously mention , but the vast number of approximate value available will be useful in many area . 
research continue on the very complex spectrum of the rare_earth element . 
new computer and automation technique were apply to these spectrum with considerable success .

person , for several year now the commuter railroad serve our large metropolitan area have find it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population want and is entitled to have . 
the cause of the decline of the commuter railroad be many and complex - high tax , losses of revenue to government subsidized highway and air carrier , to name but two . 
and the solution to the problem of the commuter line have been equally vary , range all_the_way from government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service . 
there have been a number of sound plan propose . 
but none of these has been implement . 
instead we have stand_by idly by , watch our commuter railroad service decline , and have fail to offer a helping_hand . 
though the number of people flow in and out of our metropolitan area each_day has increase tremendously since world_war_ii , , total annual rail commutation drop 124 million from 1947 to 1957 . 
nowhere has this decline be more painfully evident than in the new_york_city area . 
here the group , one of the nation 's most important carrier , has alone lose 47.6 percent of its passenger since 1949 . 
at this time of crisis in our nation 's commuter railroad , a new threat to the continued operation of the group has appear in the form of the group 's proposal for control of the group . 
the group has point_out that this control , if approve by the group , would give the combined group - group a total of 185 point serve in_common with the group . 
not_only be this kind of duplication wasteful , but it give the combined system the ability to take_away freight traffic away from the group and other railroad serve the area . 
the group note : `` the freight traffic most susceptible to raid by the group group group provide the backbone of group 's revenue . 
these revenue make_possible it possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire group system as_well_as the new_york area commuter and terminal freight services . 
if these services be to be maintained , the group must have the revenue to make them possible '' . 
the group today handle 60 percent of all southbound commuter_traffic come into new_york_city . 
this be a $ 14 million operation involve 3500 employee who work_on commuter_traffic exclusively . 
a blow to this phase of the group 's operation would have serious economic consequence not_only to the railroad itself , but to the 40000 people per day who are provide with efficient , reasonably priced transportation in_and_out of the city . 
`` there is a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful c. + o. - b. + o. merger scheme '' - 
the group has point_out . 
`` the logic of create a strong , balanced , competitive two system railroad service in the east be so obvious that group was publicly commit to the approach outline here . 
detailed study of the plan be well underway . 
though far from completion , these study indicate beyond a doubt that saving would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroad concerned , their investor , their customer , their user , and to the public at_large . 
then , abandon the study in the face of their promising outlook for all concerned , b. + o. enter on-again-off-again negotiation with c. + o. which result in the present situation . 
in the light of the fact at_hand , however , group intend to pursue the objective of help to create a healthy two system eastern railroad structure in the public interest `` . 
the group will commence its deliberation on the proposed group group o. merger on june 18 . 
obviously , the group will not force the group to further curtail its commuter operation by give undue competitive advantage to the line that wish to merge . 
however , there is a more profound consideration to this proposed merger than profit and loss . 
that_is , will it serve the long-range public interest ? 
for the past 40 year congress has advocate a carefully planned , balanced and competitive railway_system . 
we must ask ourselves which of the two alternative will help the commuter - the two-way b. group o. merger , or the three-way group group merger . 
which will serve not_only the best interest of the stockholder , but the interest of all the traveling public ? 
person , i rise today to pay tribute to a great newspaper , the group , on the occasion of a major change in its top_executive command . 
person has be a distinguished publisher of this distinguished newspaper and it be fitting that we take_notice due notice of his major contribution to american journalism on the occasion of his retirement . 
i be pleased to note that person will continue to serve as chairman_of_the_board of the group . 
person 's successor as publisher be person , who be president of the group , and who has be with the group since 1942 . 
person ' outstanding career as a journalist guarantee that the high standard which have make the group one of the world 's great newspaper will be maintain . 
i be also pleased to note that person , a member of the group staff since 1946 , has been appoint as editorial page editor . 
person succeed person , editor since 1938 , who now become editor emeritus . 
i should_like at this time , person , to pay warm tribute to person and person on the occasion of their retirement from distinguished career in american journalism . 
my hearty congratulation go to their successor , person and person , who can be count_upon to sustain the illustrious tradition of the group . 
the people of the 17th district of new_york , and i as their representative in congress , take_pride great pride in the group as one of the great and authoritative newspaper of the world . 
person , in my latest newsletter to my constituent i urge the imposition of a naval_blockade of cuba as the only effective method of prevent continued soviet armament from come into the western_hemisphere in violation of the monroe_doctrine . 
yesterday , i have the privilege of read a thoughtful article in the u._s._news_+_world_report of may eighth which discuss this type of action in more detail , include both its advantage and its disadvantage . 
under leave to extend my remark , i include the relevant portion of my newsletter , together with the text of the article from the u._s._news_+_world_report : 
`` 
cuban group : whatever may have been the setback result from the unsuccessful attempt of the cuban rebel to establish a beachhead on the person held mainland last week , there was at_least one positive benefit , and that be the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of cuba into a russian dominated military base . 
in_fact , one of the major reason for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appear to have be a lack of full information on the extent to which cuba has been get this russian military equipment . 
somehow , the picture and story of soviet t-34 tank on cuban beach and russian mig jet fighter strafe rebel troops has bring_home to all_of us the stark , blunt truth of what it mean to have a russian military base 90 mile away from home . 
russian tank and plane in cuba jeopardize the security of the united_states , violate the monroe_doctrine , and threaten the security of every other latin-american republic . 
once the full extent of_this russian military penetration of cuba be clear , person announce we would take whatever action be appropriate to prevent this , even if we have to go it alone . 
but the latin_american republic who have been rather incline to drag_one's_feet their feet on take action against person also react swiftly last week by finally throw cuba off the group . 
for years the united_states had been try to get these country to exclude person 's representative from secret military talks . 
but it take the picture of the migs and the t-34 tank to do the job . 
there is a new atmosphere of urgency in washington this week . 
you can see it , for_example , in the extensive effort person has make to enlist solid bipartisan support for his action toward both cuba and laos ; effort , as i see it , which are being direct , by_the_way , toward support for future action , not for those already past . 
what the next move will be only time , of_course , will tell . 
personally , i think we ought to set_up an immediate naval_blockade of cuba . 
we simply can n't tolerate further russian weapon , include the possibility of long-range nuclear missile , being locate in cuba . 
obviously , we can n't stop them from come_in , however , just by talk . 
a naval_blockade would be thoroughly in line with the monroe_doctrine , would be a relatively simple operation to carry_out , and would bring an abrupt end to soviet penetration of our hemisphere `` . 
look_at person now - cocky than ever with arms and agent to threaten the_americas . 
how can the united_states act ? 
blockade be one answer offer by expert . 
in it they see a way to isolate cuba , stop infiltration , maybe finish person , too . 
this be the question now face person : 
how to put a stop to the soviet buildup in cuba and to communist infiltration of this hemisphere ? 
on april twenty-fifth , the white_house report that a total embargo of remaining u.s. trade with cuba was being consider . 
its aim : to undermine further cuba 's economy . 
weaken person . 
another strategy - bold and tough - was also attract notice in washington : a naval and air blockade to cut_off cuba off from the world , destroy person . 
blockade , in the view of military and civilian expert , could restore tooth to the monroe_doctrine . 
it could halt a flood of communist arms and strategic supplies now reach person . 
it could stop cuban re export of gun and propaganda material to south_america . 
it would be the most severe reprisal , short_of declared war , that the united_states could invoke against person . 
it is the strategy of blockade , therefore , that be suddenly at the center of attention of administration official , member of congress , officer in the pentagon . 
as a possible course of action , it also be the center of debate and is raise many question . 
among these question : 
military expert say a tight naval_blockade off cuban port and at the approach to cuban water would require two naval task_force , each build around an aircraft_carrier with a complement of about 100 plane and several destroyer . 
the us_navy , on april twenty-fifth , announce it is bring_back the carrier shangri-la from the mediterranean , increase to four the number of attack_aircraft_carrier in the vicinity of cuba . 
more than 36 other big navy ship be no less_than a day 's sailing time away . 
to round_out the blockading force , submarine would be need - to locate , identify and track approaching vessel . 
land based radar would help with this task . 
so would radar picket_ship . 
a squadron of us_navy jet and another of long-range patrol plane would add support to the carrier task_force . 
three requirement go_with a blockade : it must be proclaim ; the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it ; and it must be enforce without discrimination . 
once these condition of international_law are meet , country that try to run to blockade do so at their own risk . 
blockade runner can be stop - by gunfire , if necessary - search and hold , at_least temporarily . 
they could be send to u.s. port for ruling whether cargo should be confiscate . 
plenty , say the expert . 
in a broad sense , it would reaffirm the monroe_doctrine by oppose communist interference in the western_hemisphere . 
it could , by avoid direct intervention , provide a short-of war strategy to meet short-of war infiltration . 
primary target would be shipment of tank , gun , aviation gasoline and ammunition come from russia and czechoslovakia . 
shipment of arms from western country could similarly be seize as contraband . 
in a total blockade , action could also be take against ship bring_in chemical , oil , textile , and even foodstuff . 
at_times , three ship a day from the soviet bloc are unload in cuban port . 
from its inception in 1920 with the passage of public_law 236 , group , the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation_program has been to assist the state , by means of grant-in-aid , to return disabled man and woman to productive , gainful employment . 
the authority for the program was renew several time until the vocational rehabilitation_program was make permanent as title 5 , of the social_security_act in 1935 . 
up to this time and for the next eight year , the services provide disabled person consist_of mainly of training , counseling , and placement on a job . 
recognize the limitation of such a program , the group in 1943 pass public_law 113 , which broaden the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disability , and which revise the financing structure . 
despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled person in the first eleven year after 1943 , the existing program was still see to be inadequate to cope_with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled . 
to assist the state , therefore , in rehabilitate handicapped individual , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capability '' , the group enact the vocational_rehabilitation_amendments_of_1954 ( public_law 565 ) . 
these amendment to the vocational_rehabilitation_act were design to help provide_for more specialized rehabilitation facility , for more sheltered_workshop and `` halfway '' workshop , for greater number of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individual ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvement to increase the program 's overall effectiveness . 
under the law as it exist until 1943 , the federal_government make grant to the state on the basis of population , match state expenditure on a fifty-fifty basis . 
under public_law 113 , group , the federal_government assume responsibility for 100  of necessary state expenditure in_connection_with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50  of the necessary cost of provide client with rehabilitation case services . 
throughout these year , the statutory authorization be for such sum as be necessary to carry_out the provision of the act . 
the 1954 amendment completely change the financing of the vocational_rehabilitation_program , provide_for a three part grant structure - for ( 1 ) basic support ; ( 2 ) extension and improvement ; and ( 3 ) research , demonstration , training and traineeship for vocational_rehabilitation - and in_addition for short-term training and instruction . 
the first part of the new structure - that for support the basic program of vocational_rehabilitation services - is describe in this section . 
subsequent section on grant describe the other category of the grant structure . 
the following table show , for selected year , the authorization , appropriation , allotment base , federal grant to state and state matching_funds for this part of the grant program . 
in_order to assist the state in maintain basic vocational_rehabilitation services , section 2 of the amended act provide that allotment to state for support of such services be base on ( 1 ) need , as measure by a state 's population , and ( 2 ) fiscal capacity , as measure by its per_capita income . 
the act further provide for a `` floor '' or minimum allotment , set at the 1954 level , which is call the `` base '' allotment , and a `` ceiling '' or maximum allotment , for each state . 
it stipulate , in_addition , that all amount remain as_a_result_of impose the `` ceiling '' , and not use for insure the `` floor '' , be redistribute to those state still below their maximum . 
these provision are design to reflect the difference in wealth and population among the state , with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person have access to needed services regardless of whether he reside in a state with a low or high per_capita income or a sparsely or thickly populated state . 
the provision are also design to avoid disruption in state program already in_operation , which might otherwise result from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population alone . 
the method use in compute the allotment is specifically set_forth in the act . 
the term `` state '' mean the several state , the district_of_columbia , the virgin_islands , guam and puerto_rico ; the term `` united_states '' include the several state and the district_of_columbia , and exclude the virgin_islands , guam and puerto_rico , and , prior to 1962 , alaska and hawaii . 
the following step are employ in calculation : 
for each state ( except puerto_rico , guam , the virgin_islands , and , prior to 1962 , alaska and hawaii ) determine average per_capita income based_on the last three year . 
( see source_of_data , below for per_capita income data to be use in this step . ) 
determine the average per_capita income for the u.s. based_on the last three year . 
( see source of data , below , for per_capita income data to be use in this step . ) 
determine the ratio of 50  to the average per_capita income of the u.s. ( divide 50 by the result obtain in item 2 above . ) 
determine for each state ( except the virgin_islands , guam and puerto_rico , and , prior to 1962 , alaska and hawaii ) that percentage which bear the same ratio to 50  as the particular state 's average per_capita income bear to the average per_capita income of the u.s. . 
( multiply the result obtain in item 3 above by the result obtain for each state in item 1 above . ) 
determine the particular state 's `` allotment percentage '' . 
by law this be 75  for the virgin_islands , guam and puerto_rico . 
( alaska and hawaii have fixed allotment percentage in_effect prior to fiscal_year 1962 . ) 
in all other state it be the difference obtain by subtract from 100 the result obtain in item 4 above ; except that no state shall have an allotment percentage less_than 33 - 1 3  nor more_than 75  . 
if the resulting difference for the particular state be less_than or more_than these extreme , the state 's allotment percentage must be raise or lower to the appropriate extreme . 
square each state 's allotment percentage . 
determine each state 's population . 
( see source of data , below for population data to be use in this step . ) 
multiply the population of each state by the square of its allotment percentage . 
( multiply result obtain in item 7 above , by result obtain in item 6 above . ) 
determine the sum of the product obtain in item 8 above , for all the state . 
( for each state , make all computation set_forth in item 1 to 8 above , and_then add the result obtain for each state in item 8 . ) 
determine the ratio that the amount being allot be to the sum of the product for all the state . 
( divide the amount being allot by the result obtain in item 9 above . ) 
determine the particular state 's unadjusted allotment for the particular fiscal_year . 
( multiply the state product in item 8 above by the result obtain in item 10 above . ) 
determine if the particular state 's unadjusted allotment ( result obtain in item 11 above ) be great than its maximum allotment , and if so lower its unadjusted allotment to its maximum allotment . 
( each state 's unadjusted allotment for any fiscal_year , which exceed its minimum allotment describe in item 13 below by a percentage great than one and half times the percentage by which the sum being allot exceed $ 23000000 , must be reduce by the amount of the excess . ) 
determine if the particular state 's unadjusted allotment ( result obtain in item 11 above ) be less_than its minimum ( base ) allotment , and if so raise its unadjusted allotment to its minimum allotment . 
regardless of its unadjusted allotment , each state is guarantee by law a minimum allotment each_year equal to the allotment which it receive in fiscal_year 1954 - increase by a uniform percentage of 5.4865771 which bring total 1954 allotment to all state up to $ 23000000 . 
the funds recoup by reduction in item 12 above are use : first , to increase the unadjusted allotment to the specified minimum in those state where the unadjusted allotment be less than the minimum allotment ( item 13 above ) ; and second , to increase uniformly the allotment to those state whose allotment be below their maximum , with adjustment to prevent the allotment of any state from thereby exceed its maximum . 
for the state which maintain two separate agency - one for the vocational rehabilitation of the blind , and one for the rehabilitation of person other_than the blind - the act specify that their minimum ( base ) allotment shall be divide between the two agency in the same proportion as it was divide in fiscal_year 1954 . 
funds allot in_addition to their minimum allotment are apportion to the two agency as they may determine . 
as be the case with the allotment provision for support of vocational rehabilitation services , the match requirement are also base on a statutory formula . 
prior to 1960 , in_order to provide matching_funds for the minimum ( base ) allotment , state funds have to equal 1954 state funds . 
prior to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is match at rate related_to the fiscal capacity of the state , with a pivot of 40  state ( or 60  federal ) participation in total program cost . 
the percentage of federal participation in such cost for any state is refer to in the law as that state 's `` federal share '' . 
for purpose of this explanation , this percentage is refer to as the state `` unadjusted federal share '' . 
begin in 1960 , the match requirement for the base allotment are being adjust ( upward or downward , as_required ) 25  per_year , so that by 1963 the entire support allotment will be match on the basis of a 40  pivot state share , with maximum and minimum state share of 50  and 30  , respectively . 
the pre 1960 rate of federal participation with_respect_to any state 's base allotment , as_well_as the adjusted rate in_effect during the 1960 - 1962 period , is designate by the statute as that state 's `` adjusted federal share '' . 
the provision for determine a state 's unadjusted federal share are design to reflect the varying financial resource among the state . 
the purpose of the adjusted federal share relate to the base allotment and of the transition provision for reach the unadjusted federal share be to prevent dislocation from abrupt_change in match rate . 
the method use for compute the respective federal and state share in total program cost is specifically set_forth in the act . 
the term `` state '' mean the several state , the district_of_columbia , the virgin_islands , guam and puerto_rico ; the term `` united_states '' include the several state and the district_of_columbia and exclude the virgin_islands , guam and puerto_rico , and , prior to 1962 , alaska and hawaii . 
the following step are employ in the calculation : 
for each state ( except the virgin_islands , guam , puerto_rico , and , prior to 1962 , alaska and hawaii ) , determine the average per_capita income for the last three year . 
( the same amount use in item 1 under method of compute allotment , above . ) 
determine the average per_capita income for the united_states for the last three year . 
( the same amount use in item 2 under method of compute allotment , above . ) 
determine the ratio of 40  to the average per_capita income of the united_states . 
( divide 40 by the amount use in item 2 above . ) 
determine for each state ( except the virgin_islands , guam , puerto_rico , and , prior to 1962 , alaska and hawaii ) , that percentage which bear the same ratio to 40  as the particular state 's average per_capita income bear to the average per_capita income of the united_states . 
( multiply the result obtain in item 3 above by the amount use for each state in item 1 above . ) 
determine the particular state 's `` federal share '' . 
by law this be 70  for the virgin_islands , guam and puerto_rico . 
( alaska and hawaii have fixed federal share percentage in_effect prior to fiscal_year 1962 . ) 
in all other state it be the difference obtain by subtract from 100 the result obtain in item 4 above ; except that no state shall have a federal share less_than 50  nor more_than 70  . 
if the resulting difference for the particular state be less_than or more_than these extreme , the state 's federal share must be raise or lower to the appropriate extreme . 
at the entrance side of the shelter , each roof beam is rest_on the inside 4 inch of the block wall . 
the outside 4 - inch space is fill by mortar block on edge . 
the wooden bracing between the roof beam is place flush with the inside of the wall . 
mortar is pour between this bracing and the 4 - inch block on edge to complete the wall thickness for radiation shielding . 
( for detail see inset , fig 5 . ) 
the first one or two roof board ( mark `` e '' in fig 6 ) are slip into place across the roof beam , from outside the shelter . 
these board are nail to the roof beam by reach up through the open space between the beam , from inside the shelter . 
concrete block are pass between the beam and put on the board . 
the roof block be in two layer and are not mortar together . 
work on the roof continue in this way . 
the last roof board are cover with block from outside the shelter . 
when the roof block be all in_place , the final row of wall block are mortar into position . 
the structure be complete . 
( see fig 7 . ) 
building plan be on page 21 . 
solid concrete block , relatively heavy and dense , are use for this shelter . 
these block are sell in various size so it seldom be necessary to cut a block to fit . 
solid block are recommend because hollow block would have_to be fill with concrete to give effective protection . 
brick be an alternative . 
if they are use , the wall and roof should be 10 inch thick to give the same protection as the 8 - inch solid concrete block . 
the illustration in fig 8 show how to lay a concrete block wall . 
more detailed instructions may be obtain from your local building_supply_house and craftsman . 
other source of information include the group , 38 location , chicago , illinois , the group , 33 location , chicago , illinois , and the group , washington , dc . 
an outdoor , aboveground fallout_shelter also may be build with concrete block . 
( see fig 9 , double wall shelter . ) 
most people would have_to hire a contractor to build this shelter . 
plan be on page 22 and 23 . 
this shelter could be build in region where water or rock be close to the surface , make it impractical to build an underground shelter . 
two wall of concrete block are construct at_least 20 inch apart . 
the space between them is fill with pit_run gravel or earth . 
the wall are hold together with metal tie place in the wet mortar as the wall are build . 
the roof show here ( fig 9 ) be a 6 - inch slab of reinforced_concrete , cover with at_least 20 inch of pit_run gravel . 
an alternate roof , perhaps more within do-it-yourself reach , could be construct of heavy wooden roof beam , overlay with board and waterproofing . 
it would have_to be cover with at_least 28 inch of pit_run gravel . 
the material for a double wall shelter would cost about $ 700 . 
contractor ' charge would be additional . 
the shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection . 
pre shaped corrugated metal section or precast concrete can be use for shelter either above or below ground . 
these be particularly suitable for region where water or rock be close to the surface . 
they form effective fallout_shelter when mound_over with earth , as show in figure 10 . 
material for this shelter would cost about $ 700 . 
a contractor probably would be require to help build it . 
his charge would be add to the cost of material . 
this shelter , as show on page 24 , would provide almost absolute protection from fallout radiation . 
an alternate hatchway entrance , show on page 25 , would reduce the cost of material $ 50 to $ 100 . 
the group , washington , dc , is develop plan to utilize specially treated lumber for underground shelter construction . 
the group , washington , dc , is work to develop brick and clay product suitable for shelter construction . 
an underground reinforced_concrete shelter can be build by a contractor for about $ 1000 to $ 1500 , depending_on the type of entrance . 
the shelter show would provide almost absolute fallout protection . 
the illustration ( fig 11 ) show this shelter with the roof at ground_level and mounded_over . 
the same shelter could be build into an embankment or below ground_level . 
plan for the shelter , with either a stairway or hatchway entrance , are show on page 26 and 27 . 
another type of shelter which give excellent fallout protection can be build as an added room to the basement of a home under construction . 
it would add about $ 500 to the total cost of the home . 
the shelter illustrate in figure 12 be based on such a room build in a new home in the washington , dc area in the spring of 1959 . 
important consideration common to each type of shelter be : 
arrangement of the entrance . 
ventilation . 
radio reception . 
lighting . 
the entrance must have at_least one right_angle turn . 
radiation scatter somewhat like light . 
some will go around a corner . 
the rest continue in a straight_line . 
therefore , sharp turn in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter . 
ventilation is provide in a concrete block basement shelter by vent in the wall and by the open entrance . 
a blower may be install to increase comfort . 
a blower be essential for the double wall shelter and for the underground shelter . 
it should provide not less_than 5 cubic_foot per minute of air per person . 
vent pipe also be necessary ( as show in fig 9 , 10 , and 11 ) , but filter be not . 
radio reception is cut_down by the shielding necessary to keep_out radiation . 
as_soon_as the shelter is complete a radio reception check must be make . 
it probably will be necessary to install an outside antenna , particularly to receive conelrad broadcast . 
lighting be an important consideration . 
continuous low-level lighting may be provide in the shelter by_means_of a 4 - cell hot-shot battery to which is wire a 150 - milliampere flashlight type bulb . 
test have show that such a device , with a fresh battery , will furnish light continuously for at_least 10 day . 
with a spare battery , a source of light for 2 week or more would be assure . 
a flashlight or electric lantern also should be available for those period when a bright light is need . 
there should be a regular electric_outlet in the shelter as power may continue in many area . 
other consideration . 
- if there be outside window in the basement corner where you build a shelter , they should be shield as show in the appendix , page 29 . 
other basement window should be block when an emergency threaten . 
basement wall that project above the ground should be shield as show in the appendix , page 29 . 
in these shelter the entrance should be not more_than 2 foot wide . 
bunk , or material to build them , may have_to be put inside the enclosure before the shelter wall are complete . 
the basement or belowground shelter also will serve for tornado or hurricane protection . 
the radioactivity of fallout decay rapidly at_first . 
forty-nine hour after an atomic burst the radiation intensity be only about 1 percent of what it be an hour after the explosion . 
but the radiation may be so intense at_the_start that one_percent may be extremely dangerous . 
therefore , civil_defense instruction receive over conelrad or by other means should be follow . 
a battery powered radio be essential . 
radiation instrument suitable for home use be available , and would be of_value in locate that portion of the home which offer the best protection against fallout radiation . 
there be a possibility that battery powered radio with built-in radiation meter may become available . 
one instrument thus would serve both purpose . 
your local civil_defense will gather its own information and will receive broad information from state and federal source . 
it will tell you as_soon_as possible : 
how long to stay in your shelter . 
how soon you may go outdoors . 
how long you may stay outside . 
you should be prepared to stay in your shelter full-time for at_least several day and to make it your home for 14 day or longer . 
a checklist in the appendix , ( page 30 ) tell what is need . 
family with child will have particular problem . 
they should provide_for simple recreation . 
there should be a task for everyone and these task should be rotate . 
part of the family should be sleep while the rest be awake . 
to break the monotony it may be necessary to invent task that will keep the family busy . 
record such_as diary can be keep . 
the survival of the family will depend largely on information receive by radio . 
a record should be keep of the information and instruction , include the time and date of broadcast . 
family rationing probably will be necessary . 
blower should be operate periodically on a regular schedule . 
there will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation has decay enough to allow use of the whole basement . 
however , as much time as possible should be spend within the shelter to hold radiation exposure to a minimum . 
the housekeeping problem of live in a shelter will begin as_soon_as the shelter is occupy . 
food , medical supplies , utensil , and equipment , if not already store in the shelter , must be quickly gather_up and carry into it . 
after the family has settle in the shelter , the housekeeping rule should be spell_out by the adult in charge . 
sanitation in the confines of the family shelter will require much thought and planning . 
provision for emergency toilet facility and disposal of human_waste will be an unfamiliar problem . 
a covered container such_as a kitchen garbage pail might do as a toilet . 
a 10 - gallon garbage_can , with a tightly_fitting cover , could be use to keep the waste until it be safe to leave the shelter . 
water rationing will be difficult and should be plan carefully . 
a portable electric_heater be advisable for shelter in cold climate . 
it would take the chill from the shelter in the beginning . 
even if the electric_power fail after an attack , any time that the heater has been use will make the shelter that_much more comfortable . 
body heat in the close quarters will help keep_up the temperature . 
warm clothing and bedding , of_course , be essential . 
open flame heating or cooking should be avoid . 
a flame would use_up air . 
some family already have hold weekend rehearsal in their home shelter to learn the problem and to determine for themselves what supplies they would need . 
few area , if any , be as_good_as prepared shelter but they be worth know about . 
a family dwelling without a basement provide some natural shielding from fallout radiation . 
on the ground_floor the radiation would be about half what it be outside . 
the best protection would be on the ground_floor in the central part of the house . 
a belowground basement can cut the fallout radiation to one tenth of the outside level . 
the safe place be the basement corner least exposed to window and deep below ground . 
if there be time after the warning , the basement shielding could be improve substantially by block window with brick , dirt , book , magazine , or other heavy material . 
large apartment_building of masonry or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual family dwelling . 
in_general , such apartment afford more protection than smaller building because their wall be thick and there be more space . 
the central area of the ground_floor of a heavily construct apartment_building , with concrete floor , should provide more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling . 
the basement of such an apartment_building may provide as much natural protection as the specially construct concrete block shelter recommend for the basement of a family dwelling . 
the federal_government is aid local_government in several place to survey residential , commercial and industrial building to determine what fallout protection they would provide , and for how many person . 
the problem for the city apartment dweller be primarily to plan the use of existing space . 
such planning will require the cooperation of other occupant and of the apartment management . 
a former group official become a group vice_president and set_about maximize group 's share of the group market . 
line of communication were establish between the two company and several group product were actively promote . 
within a_few year various group manufactured item were fill the entire requirement of from four to seven of group ' eight operating division . 
the group division , long control by the person brother under a voting_trust even though group own a majority of its stock , follow an independent course for many year , but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance had collapse '' and its purchase from group `` compare favorably '' with purchase by other group division . 
competitor come to receive high percentage of group business in later year , but it be `` likely '' that this trend stem `` at_least in part '' from the need of group outstrip group 's capacity . 
`` the fact that stick_out in this voluminous record be that the bulk of group 's production has always supply the large part of the requirement of the one customer in the automobile_industry connect to group by a stock interest . 
the inference be overwhelming that group 's commanding position was promote by its stock interest and was not gain solely on competitive merit '' . 
353_u._s._,_at_605 . 
this court agree with the trial_court `` that consideration of price , quality and service were not overlook by either group or group '' . 
353_u._s._,_at_606 . 
however , it determine that neither this factor , nor `` the fact that all concerned in high executive post in both company act honorably and fairly , each in the honest conviction that his action be in the best interest of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone , include group 's competitor '' , 353_u._s._,_at_607 , outweigh the government 's claim for relief . 
this claim , as submit to the group and dismiss by it , 126_f._supp .235 , allege violation not_only of 7 of the clayton_act , but also of 1 and 2 of the group . 
the latter provision proscribe any contract , combination_in_restraint_of_trade , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempt , combination , or conspiracy to monopolize , such trade . 
however , this court put to one side without consideration the government 's appeal from the dismissal of its sherman_act allegation . 
it rest_on its decision solely on 7 , which read in pertinent part : `` [ n_]_o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engage also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquire and the corporation make the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce . 
this section shall not apply to corporation purchase such stock solely for investment and not use the same by vote or otherwise to bring_about , or in attempt to bring_about , the substantial lessening of competition `` . 
the purpose of_this provision was thus explain in the court 's opinion : `` section 7 is design to arrest in its incipiency not_only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraint or monopoly in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation . 
the section is violate whether or not actual restraint or monopoly , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occur or are intend '' . 
353_u._s._,_at_589 . 
thus , a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was exclude from the court 's decision . 
indeed , as already note , the court proceed on the assumption that the executive involved in the dealing between group and group act `` honorably and fairly '' and exercise their business judgment only to serve what they deem the best interest of their own company . 
this , however , did not bar find that group had become preeminent as a supplier of automotive fabric and finish to group ; that these product constitute a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the clayton_act ; that group ' share of the market for these product be substantial ; and that competition for this share of the market was endanger by the financial relationship between the two concern : 
`` the statutory policy of foster free competition is obviously further when no supplier have an advantage over his competitor from an acquisition of his customer 's stock likely to have the effect condemn by the statute . 
we repeat , that the test of a violation of 7 be whether , at the time of suit , there be a reasonable probability that the acquisition be likely to result in the condemned restraint . 
the conclusion upon this record be inescapable that such likelihood was prove as to this acquisition '' . 
353_u._s._,_at_607 . 
on the basis of the finding which lead to this conclusion , the court remand the case to the group to determine the appropriate relief . 
the sole guidance give the court for discharge the task commit to it be this : `` the judgment must therefore be reverse and the case remand to the group for a determination , after further hearing , of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effect of the acquisition offensive to the statute . 
the group , in the framing of equitable decree , are clothe ' with large discretion to model their judgment to fit the exigency of the particular case ' . 
international_salt_co._v._united_states_,_332_u._s._392_,_400_-_401 '' . 
353_u._s._,_at_607_-_608 . 
this bring us to the course of the proceedings in the group . 
this court 's judgment was file in the group on july 18 , 1957 . 
the first pretrial conference - hold to appoint amicus_curiae to represent the interest of the stockholder of group and group and to consider the procedure to be follow in the subsequent hearing - take_place on september 25 , 1957 . 
at the outset , the government 's spokesman explain that counsel for the government and for group had already hold preliminary discussion with a view to arrive at a relief plan that both side could recommend to the court . 
group , he say , had propose disenfranchisement of its group stock along with other restriction on the group relationship . 
the government , deem these suggestion inadequate , had urge that any judgment include divestiture of group 's share of group . 
counsel for the government invite group 's view on this proposal before recommend a specific program , but state that if the court desire , or if counsel for group think further discussion would not be profitable , the government be prepared to submit a plan within thirty day . 
counsel for group indicate a preference for the submission of detailed plan by both side at an early date . 
no previous antitrust_case , he say , had involve interest of such magnitude or present such complex problem of relief . 
the submission of detailed plan would place the issue before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement in the abstract . 
the court adopt this procedure with an appropriate time schedule for carry_out it out . 
the government submit its proposed decree on october 25 , 1957 . 
the plan call_for divestiture by group of its 63000000 share of group stock by equal annual distribution to its stockholder , as a dividend , over a period of ten year . 
group and group , major stockholder in group , and the stockholder of group were deal with specially by provision require the annual sale by a trustee , again over a ten year period , of group 's group stock allocable to them , as_well_as any group stock which group and group own outright . 
if , in the trustee 's judgment , `` reasonable market condition '' did not prevail during any given year , he was to be allow to petition the court for an extension of time within the ten year period . 
in_addition , the right_to_vote the group stock hold by group was to be vest in group 's stockholder , other_than group and group and the stockholder of group ; group , group , and group were to be enjoin from acquire stock in or exercise control over group ; group , group , and group were to be prohibit to have any director or officer in_common with group , and vice_versa ; and group and group were to be order to terminate any agreement that provide_for the purchase by group of any specified percentage of its requirement of any group manufactured product , or for the grant of exclusive patent_right , or for a grant by group to group of a preferential right to make or sell any chemical discovery of group , or for the maintenance of any joint commercial_enterprise by the two company . 
on motion of the amicus_curiae , the court direct that a ruling be obtain from the person as to the federal income_tax consequence of the government 's plan . 
on may 9 , 1958 , the commissioner announce his ruling . 
the annual dividend pay to group stockholder in share of group stock would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of group 's earnings and profits . 
the measure , for federal income_tax purpose , of the dividend to individual stockholder would be the fair market_value of the share at the time of each annual distribution . 
in the case of taxpaying corporate stockholder , the measure would be the lesser of the fair market_value of the share or group 's tax basis for them , which be approximately $ 2.09 per share . 
the forced_sale of the group stock own by or allocable to group , group , and the stockholder of group , and deposit with the trustee , would result in a tax to those party at the capital_gain rate . 
group 's counterproposal was file on may 14 , 1958 . 
under its plan group would retain its group share but be require to pass_on to its stockholder the right_to_vote those share . 
group and group would , in_turn , be require to pass_on the voting_right to the group share allocable to them to their own stockholder . 
group would be enjoin from have as a director , officer , or employee anyone who be simultaneously an officer or employee of group , and no director , officer , or employee of group could serve as a director of group without court approval . 
group would be deny the right to acquire any additional group stock except through group ' distribution of stock or subscription_right to its stockholder . 
on june 6 , 1958 , group submit its objection to the government 's proposal . 
it argue , inter_alia , that a divestiture order would severely depress the market_value of the stock of both group and group , with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundred of thousand of innocent investor , among them thousand of small trust and charitable institution ; that there would be a similar decline in the market_value of other automotive and chemical stock , with similar loss to the stockholder of those company ; that the tremendous volume of group stock hang over the market for ten year would hamper the effort of group and other automobile manufacturer to raise equity capital ; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock_market and on general business_activity . 
group comprehensively contend that the government plan would not be `` in the public interest '' as_required by the mandate of_this court . 
the decree propose by the amicus_curiae were file in august of 1958 . 
these plan , like group 's contain provision for pass the vote on group 's group share on to the ultimate stockholder of group , group , and group , except that officer and director of the three company , their spouse , and other people live in their household , as_well_as other specified person , were to be totally disenfranchise . 
both plan also prohibit common director , officer , or employee between group , group , and group , on_the_one_hand , and group on_the_other_hand . 
it is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense '' to believe that husband and wife should not be subject to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permit to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship . 
while it is easy enough to ridicule person ' pronouncement in pleas_of_the_crown from a metaphysical point_of_view , the concept of the `` oneness '' of a married_couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife be such_that their action be not always to be regard by the criminal_law as if there be no marriage . 
by make inroad in the name of law_enforcement into the protection which congress has afford to the marriage relationship , the court today continue in the path chart by the recent decision in wyatt_v._united_states , 362_u._s._525 , where the court hold that , under_the_circumstances of that case , a wife could be compel to testify against her husband over her objection . 
one need not waver in his belief in virile law_enforcement to insist that there are other thing in american life which be also of great importance , and to which even law_enforcement must accommodate itself . 
one of these be the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage . 
the court 's opinion dogmatically assert that the husband wife conspiracy doctrine does not in_fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrone [ s ] an unreality into a rule of law '' . 
i am not easily persuade that a rule accept by so many people for so many century can be so lightly dismiss . 
but in_any_event , i submit that the power to depose belong_to congress , not to this court . 
i dissent . 
petitioner , who claim to be a conscientious_objector , was convict of violate 12 ( a ) of the universal_military_training_and_service_act by refuse to be induct into the armed_forces . 
he claim that he was deny due_process_of_law in violation of the fifth_amendment , because ( 1 ) at a hearing before a hearing_officer of the group he was not permit to rebut statement attribute to him by the local board , and ( 2 ) at the trial , he was deny the right to have the hearing_officer 's report and the original report of the group as to his claim . 
hold : on the record in this case , the administrative procedure prescribed by the act were fully comply with ; petitioner was not deny due_process ; and his conviction is sustain . 
pp. 60 - 66 . 
petitioner was not deny due_process in the administrative proceedings , because the statement in_question be in his file , to which he have access , and he have opportunity to rebut it both before the hearing_officer of the group and before the appeal_board . 
pp. 62 - 63 . 
petitioner was not entitle to have the hearing_officer 's note and report , especially since he fail to show any particular need for them and he did have a copy of the group 's recommendation to the appeal_board . 
pp. 63 - 64 . 
petitioner was not entitle , either in the administrative hearing at the group or at his trial , to inspect the original report of the group , since he was furnish a resume of it , did not challenge its accuracy , and show no particular need for the original report . 
pp. 64 - 66 . 
person argue the cause and file a brief for petitioner . 
person argue the cause for the united_states . 
on the brief be person , person , person and person . 
person deliver the opinion of the court . 
this be a prosecution for refusal to be induct into the armed_service , in violation of the provision of the universal_military_training_and_service_act , 62_stat._604_,_622_,_50_u._s._c._app._462_(_a ) . 
petitioner , who claim to be a conscientious_objector , contend that he was deny due_process , both in the proceedings before a hearing_officer of the group and at trial . 
he say that he was not permit to rebut before the hearing_officer statement attribute to him by the local board , and , further , that he was deny at trial the right to have the group hearing_officer 's report and the original report of the group as to his claim - all in violation of the fifth_amendment . 
the trial_judge decide that the administrative procedure of the act were fully comply with and refuse to require the production of such document . 
petitioner was find guilty and sentence to 15 month ' imprisonment . 
the group affirm . 
269_f._2_d_613 . 
we grant certiorari in view of the importance of the question in the administration of the act . 
361_u._s._899 . 
we have conclude that petitioner 's claim are control by the rationale of gonzales_v._united_states , 348_u._s._407_(_1955_) , and united_states_v._nugent , 346_u._s .1_(_1953 ) , and therefore affirm the judgment . 
petitioner register with group , location , on march 17th , 1952 . 
his answer to the classification questionnaire reflect that he be a minister of group , employ at night by a sugar producer . 
he claim 4_,_-_d classification as a minister of religion , devote a minimum of 100 hour a month to preaching . 
on november 13th , 1952 , he was classify in class 1 , -_a . 
on november 22 , 1952 , he write the group , protest this classification . 
he again state that he be `` a regular minister '' ; that he was `` devote an average of 100 hour a month to actually preach publicly '' , in_addition to 50 to 75 hour in other ministerial duty , and that he oppose war in any form . 
thereafter he was classify 1_,_-_o . 
on april 1st , 1953 , after some six month of full-time `` pioneering '' , petitioner discontinue devote 100 hour a month to preaching , but fail to so notify his local board . 
in a periodic review , the local board on july 30th , 1953 , reclassify him 1_,_-_a and uphold this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner , because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home . 
upon administrative approval of the reclassification , he was order to report for induction on june 11th , 1956 , but fail to do so . 
he was not prosecute , however , and his case was subsequently reopen , in the light of sicurella_v._united_states , 348_u._s._385_(_1955_) . 
he was again reclassify 1_,_-_a by the local board . 
there follow a customary group hearing , at which petitioner appear . 
in his report to the person , the hearing_officer suggest that the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service . 
on march 21 , 1957 , however , the group recommend approval of the 1_,_-_a classification . 
its ground for this recommendation be that , while petitioner claim before the local board august 17th , 1956 ( as evidence by its memorandum in his file of that date ) , that he was devote 100 hour per month to actual preaching , the headquarters of the group report that he was no_longer do so and , on_the_contrary , had relinquish both his pioneer_and_bible_student_servant position . 
it report that he now devote only some 6 - 12 hour per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hour per month to church activity . 
his claim be therefore `` so highly exaggerate '' , the group conclude , that it `` cast doubt upon his veracity and , consequently , upon his sincerity and good_faith '' . 
the appeal_board furnish petitioner a copy of the recommendation . 
in his answer thereto , he advise the board that he had make no such statement in 1956 , and assert that his only claim to `` pioneering '' be in 1952 . 
the appeal_board , however , unanimously concur in the group 's recommendation . 
upon return of the file to the local board , petitioner was again order to report for induction and this prosecution follow his failure to do so . 
petitioner first contend that the group deny him procedural due_process by not give him timely opportunity , before its final recommendation to the appeal_board , to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of devote 100 hour to actual preaching . 
but the statement of the local board attribute this claim to petitioner be in his file . 
he admit that he know it be open to him at all time , and he could have rebut it before the hearing_officer . 
this he fail to do , assert that he did not know it to be in his file . 
apparently he never take the trouble to find_out . 
nevertheless he have ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal_board . 
after the recommendation of the group is forward to the appeal_board , that be the appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial . 
this he do . 
we find in gonzales_v._united_states , supra , that this be the control reason why copy of the recommendation should be furnish a registrant . 
we say there that it be necessary `` that a registrant be give an opportunity to rebut [ the group 's ] recommendation when it come to the appeal_board , the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification '' . 
348_u._s._,_at_412 . 
we fail to see how such procedure result in any prejudice to petitioner 's contention , which was consider by the appeal board and deny by it . 
as was say in gonzales , `` it be the appeal_board which render the selective_service determination consider ' final ' in the court , not to be overturn unless there is no basis in fact . 
estep_v._united_states , 327_u._s._114_'' . 
348_u._s._,_at_412_-_413 . 
but there are other contention which might be consider more difficult . 
at his trial , petitioner seek to secure through subpoena_duces_tecum the longhand note of the group 's hearing_officer , person , as_well as his report thereon . 
petitioner also claim at trial the right to inspect the original group report to the group . 
he allege no specific procedural error or evidence withhold ; nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the group report might disclose . 
section 6_(_j_) of the act , as we have hold , does require the group 's recommendation to be place in a registrant 's file . 
gonzales_v._united_states , supra . 
but there is nothing in the act require the hearing_officer 's report to be likewise turn_over to the registrant . 
while the regulation formerly require that the hearing_officer 's report be place in the registrant 's file , this requirement was eliminate in 1952 . 
moreover , the hearing_officer 's report be but intradepartmental , is direct to the person and , of_course , be not the recommendation of the group . 
it be not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the group , of which the person receive many , and to which he may give his approval or rejection . 
it be but part of the whole process within the group that go_into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board . 
it be also significant that neither this report nor the hearing_officer 's note were furnish to the appeal board . 
hence the petitioner have full opportunity to traverse the only conclusion of the group on file with the group . 
petitioner know that the group 's recommendation was base not on the hearing_officer 's report but on the statement of the local board in his file . 
having have every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local board before both the hearing_officer and the appeal board , petitioner cannot now claim that he was deny due_process because he did not succeed . 
it appear to us that the same reasoning apply to the production of the hearing_officer 's report and note at the trial . 
in_addition , petitioner has fail to show any particular need for the report and note . 
while there be now allegation of the withholding of `` favorable evidence develop at the hearing '' and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing '' , no such claim was make by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process . 
moreover , his testimony at trial never develop any such fact . 
in the light of these circumstance , as_well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect center_on entirely on the group 's recommendation , which petitioner repudiate but which both the appeal board and the court below find support by the record , we find no relevancy in the hearing_officer 's report and note . 
finally petitioner say that he was entitled to inspect the group report during the proceedings before the hearing_officer as_well as at the trial . 
he did receive a resume of it - the same that was furnish the appeal board - and he make no claim of its inaccuracy . 
even now no such claim is assert . 
he base his present contention on the general right to explore , indicate that he hope to find some discrepancy in the resume . 
but this is fully answer by united_states_v._nugent , supra . 
there we hold `` that the statutory scheme for review , within the selective_service_system , entitle [ conscientious_objector ] to no guarantee that the group report must be produce for their inspection '' . 
346_u._s._,_at_5_-_6 . 
even if we were not bound by nugent , petitioner here would not be entitle to the report . 
the recommendation of the group - as_well as the decision of the appeal board - was base entirely on the local board file , not on an group report . 
with this enlarged role in mind , i should_like to make a_few suggestion : what we in the united_states do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happen in the rest of the world . 
we in this department must think_about foreign_policy in its total context . 
we cannot regard foreign_policy as something left_over after defense_policy or trade_policy or fiscal_policy has been extract . 
foreign_policy be the total involvement of the american people with people and government abroad . 
that mean that , if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership , we must think in_terms_of the total context of our situation . 
it be the concern of the department_of_state that the american people be safe and secure - defense be not a monopoly concern of the department_of_defense . 
it be also the concern of the department_of_state that our trading relationship with the rest of the world be vigorous , profitable , and active - this be not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the department_of_commerce . 
we can no_longer rely_on interdepartmental machinery `` somewhere upstairs '' to resolve difference between this and other department . 
person will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination of policy . 
means must be find to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleague in other department concerned with foreign_policy . 
i think we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action . 
every policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer . 
unless we keep our eye on the horizon ahead , we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present . 
the movement of event be so fast , the pace so severe , that an attempt to peer into the future be essential if we are to think accurately about the present . 
if there be anything which we can do in the executive_branch of the government to speed_up the process by which we come_to decision on matter on_which we must act promptly , that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of our affairs . 
action take today be often far more valuable than action take several month later in response to a situation then out of control . 
there will of_course be time for delay and inaction . 
what i am suggest be that when we delay , or when we fail to act , we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic or procedural difficulty . 
i also hope that we can do something about reduce the infant_mortality_rate of idea - an affliction of all bureaucracy . 
we want to stimulate idea from the bottom to the top of the department . 
we want to make sure that our junior colleague realize that idea be welcome , that initiative go_down right down to the bottom and go all_the_way to the top . 
i hope no one expect that only presidential appointee are look_upon as source of idea . 
the responsibility for take the initiative in generate idea be that of every officer in the department who have a policy function , regardless of rank . 
further , i would hope that we could pay_attention to little thing . 
while observe the operation of our government in various part of the world , i have feel that in many situation where our policy be good we have tend to ignore minor problem which spoil our main effort . 
to cite only a_few example : 
the wrong man in the wrong position , perhaps even in a junior position abroad , can be a source of great harm to our policy ; the attitude of a un delegate who experience difficulty in find adequate housing in new_york_city , or of a foreign diplomat in similar circumstance in our capital , can be easily be direct against the united_states and all that it stand_for . 
dozens of seemingly small matter go_wrong all_over the world . 
sometimes those who know about them be too far down the line to be able to do anything about them . 
i would hope that we could create the recognition in the department and overseas that those who come_across little thing go_wrong have the responsibility for bring these to the attention of those who can do something about them . 
if the department_of_state is to take primary responsibility for foreign_policy in washington , it follow that the ambassador is expect to take_charge overseas . 
this does not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active , operational , interested , responsible fashion . 
he is expect to know about what is go_on among the representative of other agency who are station in his country . 
he is expect to supervise , to encourage , to direct , to assist in any way he can . 
if any official operation abroad begin to go_wrong , we shall look_to the ambassador to find_out why and to get suggestion for remedial action . 
it occur to me that you might be interested in some thought which i express privately in recent year , in the hope of clear_up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign_policy be all about and what it mean , and of develop a certain compassion for those who are carry such responsibility inside government . 
i try to do so by call to their attention some of the problem that a senior departmental policy officer face . 
this mean practically everybody in this room . 
whether it will strike_home for you or not will be for you to determine . 
the senior policy officer may be move to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of stimulus : an idea in his own head , the suggestion of a colleague , a question from the secretary or the president , a proposal by another department , a communication from a foreign government or an american ambassador abroad , the filing of an item for the agenda of the united_nations or of any other of dozens of international body , a news_item read at the breakfast_table , a question to the president or the secretary at a news_conference , a speech by a senator or congressman , an article in a periodical , a resolution from a national organization , a request for assistance from some private american interest abroad , etcetera , ad_infinitum . 
the policy officer live with his antenna alert for the question which fall within his range of responsibility . 
his first thought be about the question itself : 
is there a question here for american foreign_policy , and , if so , what be it ? 
for he know that the first and sometimes most difficult job be to know what the question be - that when it is accurately identify it sometimes answer itself , and that the way in which it is pose frequently shape the answer . 
chew_over it over with his colleague and in his own mind , he reach a tentative identification of the question - tentative because it may change as he explore it further and because , if no tolerable answer can be find , it may have to be change into one which can be answer . 
meanwhile he has been think_about the fact surround the problem , fact which he know can never be complete , and the general background , much of which has already be lost to history . 
he be appreciative of the expert help available to him and draw these resource into play , take_care to examine at_least some of the raw_material which underlie their frequently policy oriented conclusion . 
he know that he must give the expert his place , but he know that he must also keep him in it . 
he is already begin to box the compass of alternative line of action , include do nothing . 
he know that he is think_about action in_relation_to a future which can be perceive but dimly through a merciful fog . 
but he take his bearing from the great guideline of policy , well established precedent , the commitment of the united_states under international charter and treaty , basic statute , and well understood notion of the american people about how we are to conduct ourselves , in policy literature such_as country papers and group papers accumulate in the department . 
he will not be surprised to find that general principle produce conflicting result in the factual situation with which he is confront . 
he must think_about which of these principle must take precedence . 
he will know that general policy papers write month before may not fit his problem because of crucial change in circumstance . 
he be aware that every moderately important problem merge imperceptibly into every other problem . 
he must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it cannot be handle without relation_to the whole - when the whole be too_large to grasp . 
he must think_of others who have a stake in the question and in its answer . 
who should be consult among his colleague in the department or other department and agency of the government ? 
which american ambassador could provide helpful advice ? 
be private interest sufficiently involved to be consult ? 
what be the probable attitude of other government , include those less directly involved ? 
how and at what stage and in what sequence are other government to be consult ? 
if action is indicate , what kind of action be relevant to the problem ? 
the selection of the wrong tool can mean waste , at_best , and at_worst an unwanted inflammation of the problem itself . 
can the president or the secretary act under existing authority , or will new legislation and new money be required ? 
should the action be unilateral or multilateral ? 
be the matter one for the united_nations or some_other international body ? 
for , if so , the path lead through a complex process of parliamentary diplomacy which add still another dimension to the problem . 
what type of action can hope to win public support , first in this country and then abroad ? 
for the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in_general the effectiveness of policy will be condition by the readiness of the country to sustain it . 
he be interested in public opinion for two reason : 
first , because it be important in itself , and , second , because he know that the american public care about a decent respect for the opinion of mankind . 
and , given probable public attitude - about which reasonably good estimate can be make - what action be called_for to insure necessary support ? 
may i add a caution on this particular point ? 
we do not want policy officer below the level of presidential appointee to concern themselves too_much with problem of domestic politics in recommend foreign_policy action . 
in_the_first_place our business be foreign_policy , and it be the business of the presidential leadership and his appointee in the department to consider the domestic political aspect of a problem . 
person emphasize this point by say , `` you fellow in the department_of_state do n't know much about domestic politics '' . 
this be an important consideration . 
if we sit here read editorial and look at public_opinion_poll and other report that cross our desk , we should realize that this be raw , undigested opinion expressed in the absence of leadership . 
what the american people will do turn_on in large degree on their leadership . 
we cannot test public_opinion until the president and the leaders of the country have go to the public to explain what be required and have ask them for support for the necessary action . 
i doubt , for_example , that , 3 month before the leadership begin to talk_about what come to be the marshall_plan , any public_opinion expert would have say that the country would have accept such proposal . 
the problem in the policy officer 's mind thus begin to take_shape as a galaxy of utterly complicated factor - political , military , economic , financial , legal , legislative , procedural , administrative - to be sort_out and handle within a political_system which move by consent in_relation_to an external environment which cannot be under_control . 
and the policy officer have the hounds of time snapping_at_his_heels . 
strategy and tactics of the u.s. military_force are now undergo one of the greatest transition in history . 
the change of emphasis from conventional type to missile type warfare must be make with care , mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglect in favor of the other . 
our military_force must be capable of contend successfully with any contingency which may be force upon us , from limited emergency to all-out nuclear general war . 
- this budget will provide_for in the fiscal_year 1961 for the continued support of our force at approximately the present level - a year-end strength of 2489000 man and woman in the active force . 
the force to be support include an army of 14 division and 870000 men ; a navy of 817 active ship and 619000 men ; a marine_corps of 3 division and 3 air wing with 175000 men ; and an air_force of 91 combat wing and 825000 men . 
if the reserve component are to serve effectively in time of war , their basic organization and objective must conform_to the changing character and mission of the active force . 
quality and combat readiness must take precedence over mere number . 
under modern condition , this be especially true of the ready reserves . 
i have request the secretary of defense to reexamine the role and mission of the reserve component in_relation_to those of the active force and in the light of the changing requirement of modern warfare . 
last year the congress discontinue its previously impose minimum personnel strength limitation on the group . 
similar restriction on the strength of the army national_guard contain in the 1960 department_of_defense appropriation_act should likewise be drop . 
i strongly recommend to the congress the avoidance of mandatory floor on the size of the reserve component so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustment in keep with military necessity . 
i again propose a reduction in the army national_guard and group - from their present strength of 400000 and 300000 , respectively , to 360000 and 270000 by the end of the fiscal_year 1961 . 
these strength are consider adequate to meet the essential role and mission of the reserves in support of our national security objective . 
- about 30  of the expenditure for the department_of_defense in 1961 be for military_personnel cost , include pay for active , reserve , and retired military_personnel . 
these expenditure are estimate to be $ 12.1 billion , an increase of $ 187 million over 1960 , reflect additional longevity pay of career personnel , more dependent , an increased number of men draw proficiency pay , and social_security tax increase ( effective for the full year in 1961 compare with only 6 month in 1960 ) . 
retired pay cost are increase by $ 94 million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel . 
these increased cost are partially offset by a decrease of $ 56 million in expenditure for the reserve force , largely because of the planned reduction in strength of the group component during 1961 . 
traditionally , rate_of_pay for retired military_personnel have be proportionate to current rate_of_pay for active personnel . 
the 1958 military pay act depart from this established formula by provide_for a 6  increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of june 1 , 1958 . 
i endorse pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay_rate . 
- expenditure for operate and maintain the station and equipment of the armed_forces are estimate to be $ 10.3 billion in 1961 , which be $ 184 million more than in 1960 . 
the increase stem largely from the grow complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for new weapon and equipment . 
a substantial increase is estimate in the cost of operate additional communication_system in the air defense_program , as_well as in all program where speed and security of communication be essential . 
also , the program for fleet modernization will be step_up in 1961 cause an increase in expenditure . 
further increase arise from the civilian employee health program enact by the congress last year . 
other factor increase operating_cost include the higher unit_cost of each flying hour , up 11  in two year , and of each steam hour , up 15  . 
in total , these increase in operating_cost outweigh the savings that result from declining program and from economy measure , such_as reduced number of unit and installation , smaller inventory of major equipment , and improvement in the supply and distribution system of the armed_forces . 
in the budget message for 1959 , and again for 1960 , i recommend immediate repeal of section 601 of the act of september 28 , 1951 ( 65 stat. 365 ) . 
this section prevent the military department and the office of civil and defense mobilization from carry_out certain transaction involve real_property unless they come into agreement with the group of the senate and the house_of_representatives . 
as i have state previously , the attorney_general has advise me that this section violate fundamental constitutional principle . 
accordingly , if it is not repeal by the congress at its present session , i shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the secretary of defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determine otherwise . 
basic long line communication in alaska are now provide through federal facility operate by the army , air_force , and group . 
the grow communication need of this new state can best be meet , as they have in other state , through the operation and development of such facility by private enterprise . 
legislation has already been propose to authorize the sale of these government owned system in alaska , and its early enactment be desirable . 
- approximately 45  of the expenditure for the department_of_defense be for procurement , research , development , and construction program . 
in 1961 , these expenditure are estimate at $ 18.9 billion , compare to $ 19.3 billion in 1960 . 
the decrease , which be largely in construction and in aircraft procurement , are offset in part by increase for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such_as tank , vehicle , gun , and electronic_device . 
expenditure for shipbuilding are estimate at about the same level as in 1960 . 
new obligational authority for 1961 recommend in this budget for aircraft procurement ( exclude amount for related research and construction ) total $ 4753 million , which be $ 1390 million below that enact for 1960 . 
on_the_other_hand , the new authority of $ 3825 million propose for missile procurement ( exclude research and construction ) in 1961 be $ 581 million high than for 1960 . 
these contrast trend in procurement reflect the anticipated change in the composition and mission of our armed_forces in the year ahead . 
the department_of_defense appropriation act for the past several year have contain a rider which limit competitive bid by firm in other country on certain military supply item . 
as i have repeatedly state , this provision be much more restrictive than the general law , popularly known_as the buy american act . 
i urge once_again that the congress not reenact this rider . 
the task of provide a reasonable level of military strength , without endanger other vital aspect of our security , is greatly complicate by the swift pace of scientific progress . 
the last few year have witness what have be perhaps the most rapid advance in military technology in history . 
some weapons_system have become obsolescent while still in production , and some while still under development . 
furthermore , unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological breakthrough on any one weapon_system , in itself , often diminish the relative importance of other competitive system . 
this has necessitate a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense_program in_order to redirect resource to the new and more important weapons_system and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons_system which have been overtake by event . 
thus , in the last few year , a number of program which look very promising at the time their development was commence have since been completely eliminate . 
for_example , the importance of the regulus_2 , , a very promising aerodynamic ship to surface missile design to be launch by surface submarine , was greatly diminish by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced polaris ballistic_missile launch by submerge submarine . 
another example be the recent cancellation of the f-108 , a long range interceptor with a speed three_times as great as the speed of sound , which was design for use against manned bomber in the period of the mid 1960 's . 
the substantial progress being make in ballistic_missile technology is rapidly shift the main threat from manned bomber to missile . 
considering the high cost of the f-108 system - over $ 4 billion for the force that had been plan - and the time_period in which it would become operational , it was decide to stop further work on the project . 
meanwhile , other air_defense force are being make effective , as describe later in this message . 
the size and scope of other important program have been reduce from early plan . 
notable in this category be the jupiter and thor intermediate range ballistic_missile , which have been successfully develop , produce , and deploy , but the relative importance of which has diminish with the increase availability of the atlas intercontinental_ballistic_missile . 
the impact of technological factor is also illustrate by the history of the high energy fuel program . 
this project was start at a time when there be a critical need for a high energy fuel to provide an extra margin of range for high performance aircraft , particularly our heavy bomber . 
continuing technical problem involve in the use of this fuel , couple with significant improvement in aircraft range through other means , have now raise serious question about the value of the high energy fuel program . 
as a result , the scope of this project has been sharply curtail . 
these example underscore the importance of even more searching evaluation of new major development program and even more penetrating and far ranging analysis of the potentiality of future technology . 
the cost of develop a major weapon_system be now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercise in select new system for development , in determine the most satisfactory rate of development , and in decide the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it . 
- the deterrent power of our armed_forces come from both their nuclear retaliatory capability and their capability to conduct other essential operation in any form of war . 
the first capability is represent by a combination of manned bomber , carrier based aircraft , and intercontinental and intermediate range missile . 
the second capability is represent by our deploy ground , naval , and air force in essential forward area , together with ready reserves capable of effect early emergency reinforcement . 
the group be the principal element of our long-range nuclear capability . 
one of the important and difficult decision which had to be made in this budget concern the role of the b-70 , a long range supersonic bomber . 
this aircraft , which was plan for initial operational use about 1965 , would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic_missile system , all_of which are schedule to become available earlier . 
the first atlas icbm 's be now operational , the first two polaris submarine are expect to be operational this calendar_year , and the first titan icbm 's next year . 
the minuteman solid fueled icbm is plan to be operational about mid 1963 . 
by 1965 , several or all_of these system will have been fully test and their reliability establish . 
thus , the need for the b-70 as a strategic weapon_system be doubtful . 
however , i am recommend that development work on the b-70 airframe and engine be continue . 
it is expect that in 1963 two prototype aircraft will be available for flight testing . 
by that time we should be in a much better position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon_system . 
i am recommend additional acquisition of the improved version of the b-52 ( the b-52_h with the new turbofan_engine ) and procurement of the b-58 supersonic medium bomber , together with the support refueling tanker in each case . 
these additional modern bomber will replace some of the old b-47 medium bomber ; one b-52 can do the work of several b-47 's which it will replace . 
funds are also include in this budget to continue the equipping of the b-52 wing with the hound_dog air-to-surface_missile . 
in the coming fiscal_year additional quantity of atlas , titan , and polaris missile also will be procure .

if a taxpayer die , the executor , administrator , or legal representative must file the final return for the decedent on or before the 15th day of the 4th month follow the close of the deceased taxpayer 's normal tax year . 
suppose person , who , for 1960 , file on the basis of a calendar_year , die june 20 , 1961 . 
his return for the period january 1 to june 20 , 1961 , be_due april 16 , 1962 . 
the return for a decedent may also serve as a claim for refund of an overpayment of tax . 
in such a case , form_1310 should be complete and attach to the return . 
this form may be obtain from the local office of your district director . 
return of estate or trust be_due on or before the 15th day of the 4th month after the close of the tax year . 
under unusual circumstance a resident individual may be grant an extension of time to file a return . 
you may apply for such an extension by file form_2688 , application_for_extension_of_time_to_file , with the person for your district , or you may make your application in a letter . 
your application must include the following information : 
( 1 ) your reason for request an extension , ( 2 ) whether you file timely income_tax_return for the 3 preceding year , and ( 3 ) whether you were require to file an estimated return for the year , and if so whether you did file and have pay the estimated tax payment on or before the due_date . 
any failure to file timely return or make estimated tax payment when due must be fully explain . 
extension are not grant as a matter_of_course , and the reason for your request must be substantial . 
if you be unable to sign the request , because of illness or other good cause , another person who stand in close personal or business_relationship to you may sign the request on your behalf , state the reason why you be unable to sign . 
you should make any request for an extension early so that if it is refuse , your return may still be on_time . 
see_also interest_on_unpaid_taxes , below . 
citizen of the united_states who , on april 15 , be not in the united_states or puerto_rico , are allow an extension of time until june 15 for file the return for the preceding calendar_year . 
an extension of 2 month beyond the regular due_date for file be also available to taxpayer make return for a fiscal_year . 
taxpayer reside or travel in alaska are also allow this extension of time for file , but those reside or travel in hawaii are not allow this automatic extension .

such interest must be pay even though an extension of time for file is grant . 
if your computation on form_1040 or form_1040_a show you owe additional tax , it should be remit with your return unless you owe less_than $ 1 , in which case it is forgive . 
if payment be by cash , you should ask for a receipt . 
if you file form_1040_a and the person compute your tax , you will be send a bill if additional tax be_due . 
this bill should be pay within 30 day . 
whether the check be certify or uncertified , the tax is not pay until the check is pay . 
if the check be not good and the april 15 or other due_date deadline elapse , addition to the tax may be incur . 
furthermore , a bad check may subject the maker to certain penalty . 
all check and money_order should be make payable to internal_revenue_service . 
an overpayment of income and social_security tax entitle you to a refund unless you indicate on the return that the overpayment should be apply to your succeeding year 's estimated tax .

the deduction allow in determine adjusted_gross_income put all taxpayer on a comparable basis . 
it be the amount you enter on line 9 , page 1 of form_1040 . 
some deduction are subtract from gross income to determine adjusted_gross_income . 
other deduction are subtract only from adjusted_gross_income in arrive at taxable_income . 
to compute your adjusted gross income you total all item of income . 
( see chapter 6 . ) 
from this amount deduct the item indicate below . 
businessman deduct all ordinary and necessary expense attributable to a trade or business . 
if you hold property for the production of rent or royalty you subtract , in compute adjusted_gross_income , ordinary and necessary expense and certain other deduction attributable to the property .

( see chapter 10 . ) 
employee deduct expense of travel , meal and lodge while away from home in_connection_with the performance of their services as employee . 
they also deduct transportation expense incur in_connection_with the performance of services as employee even though they be not away from home . 
( see chapter 12 . ) 
if your employer reimburse you for expense incur , you deduct such expense if they otherwise qualify . 
( see chapter 10 . ) 
sick_pay , if include in your gross income , is deduct in arrive at adjusted_gross_income . 
if your sick_pay is not include in your gross income , you may_not deduct it . 
( see chapter 9 . ) 
if you be a life_tenant , you deduct allowable depreciation and depletion . 
if you be an income beneficiary of property hold in trust or an heir , legatee , or devisee , you may deduct allowable depreciation and depletion , if not deductible by the estate or trust .

( see chapter 20 . ) 
you also deduct 50  of the excess of net long-term capital_gain over net short-term capital_loss in determine adjusted_gross_income . 
( see chapter 24 . ) 
certain other deduction are not allow in determine adjusted_gross_income . 
they may be claim only by itemize them on page 2 of form_1040 . 
these deduction may_not be claim if you elect to use the standard deduction or tax table . 
( see chapter 30 through 37 . ) 
a minor be subject to tax on his own earnings even though his parent may , under local law , have the right to them and might actually have receive the money . 
his income be not required to be include in the return of his parent . 
a minor child is allow a personal exemption of $ 600 on his own return regardless of how much money he may earn . 
if your child be under 19 or be a student you may also claim an exemption for him if he qualify as your dependent , even though he earn $ 600 or more . 
see chapter 5 . 
your 16 year old son earn $ 720 in 1961 . 
you spend $ 800 for his support . 
since he have gross income of $ 600 or more , he must file a return in which he may claim an exemption deduction of $ 600 . 
since you contribute more_than half of his support , you may also claim an exemption for him on your return . 
a minor who have gross income of less_than $ 600 be entitled to a refund if income_tax was withhold from his wage . 
generally , the refund may be obtain by file form_1040_a accompany by the withholding statement ( form_w-2 ) . 
if he have income other_than wage subject to withholding , he may be require to file form_1040 . 
see chapter 1 . 
if your child work for you , you may deduct reasonable wage you pay to him for services he render in your business . 
you may deduct these payment even though your child use the money to purchase his own clothing or other necessity which you be normally obligated to furnish him , and even though you may be entitled to his services . 
it would have been desirable for the two community to have differ only in respect to the variable being investigate : the degree of structure in teaching_method . 
the structured school be in an industrial city , with three family tenement_house typical of the residential area , but with one rather sizable section of middle-class home . 
the unstructured school be in a large suburban community , predominantly middle-class - to upper-middle-class , but fringed by an industrial area . 
in_order to equate the sample on socioeconomic status , we choose school in both city on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhood . 
school_principal and guidance worker make rating of the various neighborhood and the research team make independent observation of house and dwelling area . 
an objective scale was develop for rate school neighborhood from these data . 
equal proportion of child in each city were draw from upper-lower-class and lower-middle-class neighborhood . 
individual difference in maturation and the development of readiness for learn to read indicate that not until the third grade have most child have ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school achievement . 
therefore , third grade child were choose as subject for this study . 
for purpose of sample selection only ( individual test were give later ) we obtain group test score of reading achievement and intelligence from school record of the entire third grade population in each school_system . 
the subject for this study were randomly select from stratified area of the distribution , one-third as underachiever , one-third medium , and one-third overachiever . 
child whose reading score be at_least one standard_deviation below the regression_line of each total third grade school population were consider underachiever for the purpose of sample selection . 
overachiever be at_least one standard_deviation above the regression_line in their school_system . 
the final sample be not significantly different from a normal_distribution in regard_to reading achievement or intelligence_test score . 
twenty-four classroom in twelve unstructured school furnish 156 case , 87 boy and 69 girl . 
eight classroom in three structured school furnish 72 case , 36 boy and 36 girl . 
administrative restriction necessitate the smaller sample size in the structured school . 
it was assume that the sampling procedure be purely random with_respect_to the personality variable under investigation . 
an interview schedule of open-ended question and a multiple-choice questionnaire were prepare , and one parent of each of the sample child was see in the home . 
the parent was ask to describe the child 's typical behavior in certain standard situation in which there was an opportunity to observe tendency toward perfectionism in demand upon self and others , irrational conformity to rule , orderliness , punctuality , and need for certainty . 
the interviewer were instruct not to suggest answer and , as_much_as_possible , to record the parent ' actual words as they describe the child 's behavior in home situation . 
the rating scale of compulsivity was construct by first peruse the interview record , categorize all evidence related to compulsivity , then arrange a distribution of such information apart from the case record . 
final rating were make on the basis of a point_system which was develop after study the distribution of actual behavior record and assign weight value to each type of behavior that be deviant from the discovered norm . 
child score high in compulsivity be those who give evidence of tension or emotionality in situation where there was lack of organization or conformity to standard and expectation , or who make exaggerated effort to achieve these goal . 
the low compulsive child be one who appear relatively unconcerned about such matter . 
for_instance , the following statement was rate low in compulsivity , `` she be naturally quite neat about thing , but it does n't bother her at_all if her room get messy . 
but she clean_up it up very well when i remind her '' . 
person , et_al. revise the taylor_anxiety_scale for use with child . 
the taylor_scale was adapt from the minnesota_multiphastic_personality_inventory , with item selection base upon clinical definition of anxiety . 
there is much research evidence to validate the use of the instrument in differentiate individual who be likely to manifest anxiety in varying degree . 
reliability and validation work with the children 's anxiety_scale by person , et_al. demonstrate result closely similar to the finding with the adult scale . 
although the taylor_scale was design as a group testing device , in this study it was individually administer by psychologically trained worker who establish rapport and assist the child in read the item . 
the question may be raise whether or not we are deal with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity . 
the two rating yield a correlation of + .04 , which be not significantly different from zero ; therefore , we have measure two different characteristic . 
in_theory , compulsive behavior be a way of diminish anxiety , and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many child the obsessive-compulsive defense be not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer . 
the issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be take_up later . 
in the primary grade , reading permeate almost every aspect of school progress , and the child 's early experience of success or failure in learn to read often set a pattern of total achievement that be relatively enduring throughout the following year . 
in establish criterion measurement , it was therefore think best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself . 
the predicted interaction effect should , if potent , extend its influence over all academic achievement . 
the stanford_achievement_test , form_j , was administer by classroom teacher , consist_of a battery of six sub-test : paragraph meaning , word meaning , spelling , language , arithmetic computation , and arithmetic reasoning . 
all_of these sub-test involve reading except arithmetic computation . 
score are state in grade equivalent on a national norm . 
the battery median grade equivalent was use in data analysis in this study . 
the wechsler_intelligence_scale_for_children was administer to each sample third grade child by a clinical worker . 
the relationship of intelligence_test score to school achievement be a well established fact ( in this case , * * f ) ; therefore , in the investigation of the present hypothesis , it was necessary to control this factor . 
the criterion score use in the statistical analysis be an index of overachievement - or underachievement . 
it be the discrepancy between the actual attained achievement test score and the score that would be predict by the i.q. . 
for_example , on the basis of the regression_equation , a child with an i.q. of 120 in this sample would be expect to earn an achievement test score of 4.8 ( grade equivalent ) . 
if a child with an i.q. of 120 score 5.5 in achievement , his discrepancy score would be + .7 , represent .7 of one year of overachievement . 
a child with an i.q. of 98 would be expect to earn an achievement test score of 3.5 . 
if such a child score three , his discrepancy score would be - .5 , represent .5 of one year of underachievement . 
in this manner , the factor measure by the intelligence_test were control , allow discovered difference in achievement to be interpret as result from other variable . 
table 1 and 2 present the result of the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is use as the descriptive variable . 
figure 1 portray the mean achievement score of each subgroup graphically . 
first_of_all , as we had surmise , the highly compulsive child in the structured setting score significantly better ( * * f ) on achievement than do similar child in the unstructured school . 
it can be see too that when we contrast level of compulsivity within the structured school , the high compulsive child do better ( * * f ) . 
no significant difference was find in achievement between high and low compulsive child within the unstructured school . 
the hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching_method was support , in this case , at the .05 level . 
while we had expect that compulsive child in the unstructured school setting would have difficulty when compare to those in the structured , we were surprise to find that the achievement of the high compulsive within the school where the whole-word_method is use in beginning reading compare favorably with that of the low compulsive . 
indeed their achievement score be somewhat better on an absolute basis although the difference be not significant . 
we speculate that compulsive in the unstructured school be under greater strain because of the lack of systematization in their school setting , but that their need to organize ( for comfort ) be so intense that they struggle to induce the phonic rule and achieve in_spite_of the lack of direction from the environment . 
it is interesting to note that medium compulsive in the unstructured school make the low achievement score ( although not significantly low ) . 
possibly their compulsivity be not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure . 
our conjecture be , then , that regardless of the manner in which school lesson are teach , the compulsive child accentuate those element of each lesson that aid him in systematize his work . 
when help by a high degree of structure in lesson presentation , then , and only then , does such a child attain unusual success . 
the statistical analysis of achievement in_relation_to anxiety and teaching_method and the interaction of the two are present in table 3 and 4 . 
figure 2 be a graph of the mean achievement score of each group . 
as predict , the highly anxious child in the unstructured school score more poorly ( * * f ) than those in the structured school . 
the interaction effect , which be significant at the .01 level , can be see best in the contrast of mean score . 
while high anxiety child achieve significantly less well ( * * f ) in the unstructured school than do low anxiety child , they appear to do at_least as well as the average in the structured classroom . 
the most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrate be the marked decrement in performance suffer by the highly anxious child in unstructured school . 
according_to the theory propose , this be a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persist unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment . 
the fact that such threat be potent in the beginning reading lesson is think to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or underachievement these child exhibit . 
the child with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety released energy toward achievement , but because his distress severely reduce the ability of discrimination and memorization of complex symbol , the child may fail in his initial attempt to master the problem . 
failure confirm the threat , and the intensity of anxiety is increase as the required learning become more difficult , so that by the time the child reach the third grade the decrement in performance be pronounced . 
the individual with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered power of discrimination . 
but the symbol he is ask to learn be simple . 
as show earlier , the highly anxious individual may be superior in his memorize of simple element . 
success reduce the prospect of threat and his power of discrimination are improve . 
by the time the child first attack the actual problem of reading , he be completely familiar and at_ease with all_of the element of word . 
apparently academic challenge in the structured setting create an optimum of stress so_that the child with high anxiety be able to achieve because he be aroused to an energetic state without become confused or panicked . 
person et_al. present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test like situation , and that his performance will be impair unless he receive supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher . 
although the present study be not a direct replication of their investigation , the result do not confirm their conclusion . 
observer , in the two school_system study here , judge the teacher in the structured school to be more impersonal and demanding , while the atmosphere in the unstructured school was judge to be more supporting and accepting . 
yet the highly anxious child suffer a tremendous disadvantage only in the unstructured school , and perform as well or better than average in the structured setting . 
analysis mean the evaluation of subpart , the comparative rating of part , the comprehension of the meaning of isolated element . 
analysis in roleplaying is usually do for the purpose of understand strong_point and weak_point of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak_part and strengthen good_part . 
up to this point stress has been place on roleplaying in_terms_of individual . 
roleplaying can be do for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedure , regardless of individual . 
for_example : a sale presentation can be analyze and evaluate through roleplaying . 
let us now put some flesh_on_the_theoretical_bones we have assemble by give illustration of roleplaying use for evaluation and analysis . 
one should keep in mind that many_of the exciting possibility of roleplaying be largely unexplored and have not been use in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other area . 
the president of a small firm sell restaurant product , have considerable difficulty in find suitable salesman for his business . 
interview , check reference , train the salesman , have them go with more experienced salesman be expensive - and the rate_of_attrition due_to resignation or unsatisfactory performance be too high . 
it be his experience that only one good salesman was find out of every seven hire - and only one was hire out of every seven interview . 
roleplaying was offer as a solution - and the procedure work as_follows : all candidate were invite to a hotel conference_room , where the president explain the difficulty he have , and how unnecessary it seem to him to hire people who just did not work_out . 
in_place_of ask salesman to fill_out questionnaire , check their reference , interview them , ask them to be try_out , he tell them he would prefer to test them . 
each person was to enter the testing_room , carry a suitcase of sample . 
each salesman was to read a sheet contain a description of the product . 
in the testing_room he was to make , successively , three presentation to three different people . 
in the testing_room , three of the veteran salesman serve as antagonist . 
one handle the salesman in a friendly manner , another in a rough manner , and the third in a hesitating manner . 
each was tell to purchase material if he feel_like it . 
the antagonist come_in , one_at_a_time , and did not see or hear the other presentation . 
after each presentation , the antagonist write his judgment of the salesman ; and so did the observer consist_of the president , three of his salesman and a psychologist . 
ten salesman were test in the morning and ten more in the afternoon . 
this procedure was repeat one day a month for four month . 
the batting_average of one success out of seven increase to one out of three . 
the president of the firm , calculate expense alone , feel his cost had drop one-half while success in selection had improve over one_hundred percent . 
the reason for the value of this procedure be simply that the applicant were test `` at work '' in different situation by the judgment of a number of expert who could see how the salesman conduct themselves with different , but typical restaurant owner and manager . 
they were , in_a_sense , `` try_out '' in realistic situation . 
from the point_of_view of the applicant , less time was waste in being evaluate - and they get a meal out of it as_well_as some insight into their performance . 
another use of roleplaying for evaluation illustrate how this procedure can be use in real_life situation without special equipment or special assistant during the daily course of work . 
the position of receptionist was open in a large office and an announcement was made to the other girl already work that they could apply for this job which have high prestige and slightly high salary than typing and clerking position . 
all applicant be generally familiar_with the work of the receptionist . 
at the end of work one day , the personnel man take the applicant one_at_a_time , ask them to sit behind the receptionist 's desk and he then play the role of a number of people who might come to the receptionist with a number of query and for a number of purpose . 
each girl was independently `` test '' by the personnel man , and he serve not_only as the director , but as the antagonist and the observer . 
somewhat to his surprise he find that one girl , whom he would never have consider for the job since she had appear somewhat mousy and also had be in the office a relatively short time , do the most outstanding job of play the role of receptionist , show wit , sparkle , and aplomb . 
she was hire and was find to be entirely satisfactory when she play the role eight hours a day . 
in consider roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area , since we are now no_longer deal with a simple overall decision but rather with the examination and evaluation of many element see in dynamic functioning . 
some case in_evidence of the use of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the procedure . 
an engineer had been make the works manager of a firm , supplant a retired employee who had been consider outstandingly successful . 
the engineer have more_than seven year of experience in the firm , be well trained , was consider a hard_worker , was respect by his fellow engineer for his technical competence and was regard_as a `` comer '' . 
however , he turn_out to be a complete failure in his new position . 
he seem to antagonize everyone . 
turnover rate of personnel go_up , production drop , and morale was visibly reduce . 
despite the fact that he was regard_as an outstanding engineer , he seem to be a very poor administrator , although no one quite know what be wrong with him . 
at the insistence of his own supervisor - the president of the firm , he enrol in a course design to develop leader . 
he play a number of typical situation before observer , other supervisor who keep note and then explain to him in_detail what he do they think be wrong . 
entirely concerned with efficiency , he be merciless in criticize people who make mistake , condemn them to too great an extent . 
he did not really listen to others , have little interest in their idea , and want to have his own way - which be the only right way . 
the entire group of manager explain , in great detail , a number of human relations error that he make . 
one_by_one , these error were discuss and one_by_one he reject accept them as error . 
he admit his behavior , and defend it . 
he refuse to change his approach , and instead he attack high_and_low - the official for their not back him , and subordinate for their laxness , stupidity , and stubbornness . 
after the diagnosing , he leave the course , convince that it could do_good him no good . 
we may say that his problem was diagnose but that he refuse treatment . 
the engineer turn works manager have a particular view of life - and refuse to change it . 
we may say that his attitude be foolish , since he may have be a success had he learn some human relations skill ; or we may say that his attitude be commendable , show his independence of mind , in his refusal to adjust to the opinion of others . 
in_any_case , he refuse to accept the implication of the analysis , that he needed to be make_over . 
another case may be give in illustration of a successful use of analysis , and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive analysis . 
in a course for supermarket operator , a district_manager who had been recently appoint to his position after be outstandingly successful as a store manager , find that in supervise other manager he was have a difficult time . 
on play some typical situation before a jury of his peer he show some characteristic rate as unsatisfactory . 
he was tell he display , for_example , a sense of superiority - and he answer : `` well , i be supposed to know all the answer , are n't i '' ? 
he was criticize for his curtness and abruptness - and he answer : `` i am not work to become popular '' . 
on being criticize for his arbitrary behavior - he answer : `` i have to make decision . 
that be my job '' . 
in_short , as frequently happen in analysis , the individual feel threatened and defend himself . 
however , in this case the district_manager was lead to see the error of his way . 
the necessary step between diagnosis and training be acceptance of the validity of the criticism . 
how this was accomplish may be describe , since this sometimes be a crucial problem . 
the director help tailor-make a checklist of the district_manager 's error by ask various observer to write_out sentence comment on the mistake they feel he make . 
these error were then collect and write on a blackboard , condense similar idea . 
eighteen error were locate , and then the director ask each individual to vote whether or not they feel that this manager had make the particular error . 
they were ask to vote `` true '' if they think they had see him make the error , `` false '' if they think he had not ; and `` cannot say '' if they be not certain . 
the manager sit behind the group so he could see and count the hand that go_up , and the director write the number on the blackboard . 
no comment were made during the voting . 
the result look as_follows : 
* * f . 
the first eight of these eighteen statement , which receive at_least one-half of the vote , were duplicate to form an analysis checklist for the particular manager , and when this particular manager roleplay in other situation , the member check any item that appear . 
to prevent the manager from deliberately control himself only during the session , they be rather lengthy ( about twenty minute ) , the situation were imperfectly describe to the manager so that he would not know what to expect , new antagonist were bring on the scene unexpectedly , and the antagonist were instruct to deliberately behave in such way as to upset the manager and get him to operate in a manner for which he had been previously criticize . 
after every session , the check_mark were total up and graph , and in this way the supervisor 's progress was chart . 
in life we learn to play our role and we `` freeze '' into pattern which become so habitual that we be not really aware of what we do . 
we can see others more clearly than we can see ourselves , and others can see us better than we see ourselves . 
to learn what we do be the first_step for improvement . 
to accept the validity of the judgment of others be the second step . 
to want to change be the third step . 
to practice new procedure under guided supervision and with constant feedback be the fourth step . 
to use these new way in daily life be the last step . 
roleplaying used for analysis follow these general step lead to training . 
when an evaluative situation is set_up , and no concern be with the detail that lead to an overall estimate , we say that roleplaying is use for evaluation . 
observer can see a person engage in spontaneous behavior , and watch him operate in a totalistic fashion . 
this behavior be more `` veridical '' - or true than other testing behavior for some type of evaluation , and so can give quick and accurate estimate of complex functioning . 
while roleplaying for testing is not too well understand at the present time , it represent one of the major use of this procedure . 
the objective of this chapter be to clarify the distinction between spontaneity theory and other training concept . 
in_addition , the basic approach utilize in apply roleplaying will be review . 
the goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated rationale to aid him in apply roleplaying technique in this unique training area . 
the reason for extract this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of training be twofold : 
spontaneity training theory be unique and relatively new . 
it is not easy for the therapist to discern when , in the patient 's communicating , an introject has appear and is hold_sway . 
one learn to become alert to change in his vocal tone - to his voice 's suddenly shift to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sound somehow artificial or , in some instance , parrotlike . 
the content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition , as if a phonograph_needle were stick in one groove ; only seldom be it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parrot some timeworn axiom , common to our culture , which he has evidently hear , over_and_over , from a parent until he experience it as part of him . 
one hebephrenic woman often become submerge in what feel to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo emotion , during which , despite her wracking sob and streaming cheek , i feel only a cold annoyance with her . 
eventually such incident become more sporadic , and more sharply demarcate from her day-after-day behavior , and in one particular session , after several minute of such behavior - which , as_usual , go_on without any accompanying words from her - she ask , eagerly , `` did you see person '' ? 
at_first i did not know what she mean ; i think she must be see me as some one who had just come from see her grandmother , in their distant home city . 
then i realize that she had been deliberately show me , this time , what person be like ; and when i reply in this spirit , she corroborate my hunch . 
at another phase in the therapy , when a pathogenic mother introject begin to emerge more_and_more upon the investigative scene , she mutter in a low but intense voice , to herself , `` i hate that woman inside me '' ! 
i could evoke no further elaboration from her about this ; but a_few second later she was stand directly across the room from me , look me in the eye and say in a scathingly condemnatory tone , `` your father despise you '' ! 
again , i at_first misconstrue this disconcertingly intense communication , and i quickly cast_around through my mind to account_for her be able to speak , with such utter conviction , of an opinion hold by my father , now several year deceased . 
then i reply , coldly , `` if you despise me , why do n't you say so , directly '' ? 
she look confused at this , and i feel sure it had be a wrong response for me to make . 
it then occur to me to ask , `` is that what that woman tell you '' ? 
she clearly agree that this had be the case . 
i realize , now , that she had been show me , in what impress me as be a very accurate way , something her mother had once say to her ; it be as if she was show me one of the reason why she hate that woman inside her . 
what had be an unmanageably powerful introject be now , despite its continuing charge of energy disconcerting to me , sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother be like . 
earlier , this woman had be so filled with a chaotic variety of introject that at_times , when she be in her room alone , it would sound to a passerby as though there be several different person in the room , as she would vocalize in various kind of voice . 
a somewhat less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine , who used_to often seclude herself in her room , often sound through the closed door - as i would find on pass_by , between our session - for_all_the_world like two person , a scolding mother and a defensive child . 
particularly hard for the therapist to grasp be those instance in_which the patient is manifest an introject traceable to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter be himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he find distinctly unwelcome . 
i have find , time_and_again , that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rest , in_the_final_analysis , on this basis ; and only when i can acknowledge this , to myself , as be indeed an aspect of my personality , does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient 's behavior . 
for_example , one hebephrenic man used_to annoy me , month after month , by say , whenever i get_up to leave and made my fairly stereotyped comment that i would be see him on the following day , or whenever , `` you 're welcome '' , in a notably condescending fashion - as though it be his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spend the hour with him , and he were thus point_up my failure to utter a humbly grateful , `` thank_you '' to him at the end of each session . 
eventually it become clear to me , partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point_out my condescension to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his condescending , `` you 're welcome '' , was very accurately personify an element of obnoxious condescension which had be present in my own demeanor , over these month , on each of these occasion when i had bid him good-bye with the consoling note , each time , that the healing christ would be stoop_to dispense this succor to the poor suffered again on the morrow . 
another patient , a paranoid woman , for many month infuriate not_only me but the ward personnel and her fellow patient by arrogantly behave as though she own the whole building , as though she be the only person in it whose need be to be meet . 
this behavior on her part subside only after i had come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between , on_the_one_hand , her arrange the ventilation of the common living_room to her own liking , or turn_off the television off or on without regard_to the wish of the others , and on_the_other_hand , my own come stolidly into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objection , bring my big easy_chair with me , usually shut the window of her room which she prefer to keep in a very cold state , and plunk myself down in my chair - in_short , behave as if i own her room . 
here a variety of meaning and emotion are concentrate , or reduce , in their communicative expression , to some comparatively simple seeming verbal or nonverbal statement . 
one find , for_example , that a terse and stereotyped verbal expression , seem at_first to be a mere hollow convention , reveal itself over the month of therapy as the vehicle for express the most varied and intense feeling , and the most unconventional of meaning . 
more_than anything , it be the therapist 's intuitive sensing of these latent meaning in the stereotype which help these meaning to become reveal , something like a spread-out deck_of_cards , on sporadic occasion over the passage of the patient 's and his month of work together . 
one cannot assume , of_course , that all these accumulated meaning be inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy , or at any one time later_on when the stereotype was utter ; probably it be correct to think_of it as a matter of a well grooved , stereotyped mode of expression - and no , or but a_few , other communicational groove , as_yet - be there , available for the patient 's use , as newly emerging emotion and idea well_up in him over the course of month . 
but it be true that the therapist can sense , when he hear this stereotype , that there be at this moment many emotional determinant at_work in it , a blurred babel of indistinct voice which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another . 
sometimes it be not a verbal stereotype - a `` how be you now '' ? or an `` i want to go_home '' , or whatever - but a nonverbal one which reveal itself , gradually , as the condensed expression of more than one latent meaning . 
a hebephrenic man used_to give a repetitious wave of his hand a number of time during his largely silent hour with his therapist . 
when the therapist come to feel on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him , `` what be that , person - hello or farewell '' ? 
, the patient reply , `` both , person - two in one '' . 
of all the possible form of nonverbal expression , that which seem best to give release , and communicational expression , to complex and undifferentiated feeling be laughter . 
it be no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient , the most severely dedifferentiated of all schizophrenic patient , show , as one of his characteristic symptom , laughter - laughter which now make one feel scorn or hate , which now make one feel_like weep , or which now give one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man 's despair ; and which , more often than all these , convey a welter of feeling which could in_no_way be convey by any number of words , words which be so unlike this welter in be formed and discrete from one another . 
to a much less full extent , the hebephrenic person 's belching or flatus have a comparable communicative function ; in work with these patient the therapist eventually gets to do some at_least private mull over of the possible meaning of a belch , or the passage of flatus , not_only because he be reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze , but also because he learn that even these animal like sound constitute form of communication in which , from_time_to_time , quite different thing are being say , long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these , as distinct feeling and concept , to say them in words . 
as i have been intimate , in the schizophrenic - and perhaps also in the dream of the neurotic ; this be a question which i have no wish to take_up - condensation be a phenomenon in which one find not a condensed expression of various feeling and idea which be , at an unconscious level , well sort_out , but rather a condensed expression of feeling and idea which , even in the unconscious , have yet to become well differentiated from one another . 
person , person and person , in their description of the disturbance of thinking find in chronic schizophrenic patient , say , in regard_to condensation , that `` the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment , and the object contain therein in itself be the prototypical condensation '' . 
in my experience , a great many_of the patient 's more puzzling verbal communication be so for the reason that concrete meaning have not become differentiate from figurative meaning in his subjective experience . 
thus he may be refer to some concrete thing , or incident , in his immediate environment by some symbolic sounding , hyperbolic reference to transcendental event on the global scene . 
recently , for_example , a paranoid woman 's large-scale philosophizing , in the session , about the intrusive curiosity which has become , in her opinion , a deplorable characteristic of mid twentieth century human culture , develop_into itself , before the end of the session , into a suspicion that i was surreptitiously peek at her partially exposed breast , as indeed i was . 
or , equally often , a concretistic seeming , particularistic seeming statement may consist , with its mundane exterior , in a form of poetry - may be full of meaning and emotion when interpret as a figurative expression : a metaphor , a simile , an allegory , or some other symbolic mode of speaking . 
of such hidden meaning the patient himself be , more_often_than_not , entirely unaware . 
his subjective experience may be a remarkably concretistic one . 
one hebephrenic woman confide to me , `` i live in a world of word '' , as if , to her , word be fully concrete object ; person , in his excellent article ( 1955 ) concern schizophrenic communication , include mention of similar clinical material . 
a borderline schizophrenic young man tell me that to him the various theoretical concept about which he had been expound , in a most articulate fashion , during session after session with me , be like great cube of almost tangibly solid matter up in the air above him ; as he speak i was remind of the great bale of cargo which are swing , high in the air , from a docked steamship . 
the many linguistic technique for reduce the amount of dictionary information that have been propose all organize the dictionary 's content around prefix , stem , suffix , etc. . 
a significant reduction in the volume of store information is thus realize , especially for a highly inflected language such_as russian . 
for english the reduction in size be less striking . 
this approach require that : ( 1 ) each text word be separate into smaller element to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary_entry , and ( 2 ) the information retrieve from several entry in the dictionary be synthesize into a description of the particular word . 
the logical scheme use to accomplish the former influence the placement of information in the dictionary file . 
implementation of the latter require storage of information need only for synthesis . 
we suggest the application of certain data_processing technique as a solution to the problem . 
but first , we must define two term so that their meaning will be clearly understand : 
form - any unique sequence of alphabetic_character that can appear in a language precede and follow by a space . 
occurrence - an instance of a form in text . 
we propose a method for select only dictionary information require by the text being translate and a means for pass the information directly to the occurrence in text . 
we accomplish this by compile a list of text form as text is read by the computer . 
a ram storage scheme , base on the spelling of form , provide an economical way to compile this text form list . 
dictionary form find to match form in the text list are mark . 
a location in the computer store is also name for each marked form ; dictionary information about the form store at this location can be retrieve directly by occurrence of the form in text . 
finally , information is retrieve from the dictionary as_required by stage of the translation process - the grammatic description for sentence_structure determination , equivalent choice information for semantic analysis , and target_language equivalent for output construction . 
the dictionary be a form dictionary , at_least in the sense that complete form are use as the basis for match text occurrence with dictionary_entry . 
also , the dictionary is divide into at_least two part : 
the list of dictionary form and the file of information that pertain to these form . 
a more detailed description of dictionary operation - text lookup and dictionary modification - give a clear picture . 
text lookup , as we will describe it , consist_of three step . 
the first be compiling a list of text form , assigning an information cell to each , and replacing text occurrence with the information cell assign to the form of each occurrence . 
for this step the computer memory is separate into three region : cell in the w_region are use for storage of the form in the text form list ; cell in the x-region and y_region are reserve as information cell for text form . 
when an occurrence * * f is isolate during text reading , a random_memory address * * f , the address of a cell in the x-region , is compute from the form of * * f . 
let * * f denote the form of * * f . 
if cell * * f has not previously been assign as the information cell of a form in the text form list , it is now assign as the information cell of * * f . 
the form itself is store in the next available cell of the w-region , begin in cell * * f . 
the address * * f and the number of cell require to store the form are write in * * f ; the information cell * * f is save to represent the text occurrence . 
text reading continue with the next occurrence . 
let us assume that * * f be identical to the form of an occurrence * * f which precede * * f in the text . 
when this situation exist , the address * * f will equal * * f which was produce from * * f . 
if * * f was assign as the information cell for * * f , the routine can detect that * * f be identical to * * f by compare * * f with the form store at location * * f . 
the address * * f is store in the cell * * f . 
when , as in_this case , the two form match , the address * * f is save to represent the occurrence * * f . 
text reading continue with the next occurrence . 
a third situation be possible . 
the formula for compute random-access_memory address from the form of each occurrence will not give a distinct address for each distinct form . 
thus , when more_than one distinct form lead to a particular cell in the x-region , a chain of information cell must be create to accommodate the form , one cell in the chain for each form . 
if * * f lead to an address * * f that be equal to the address compute from * * f , even though * * f does not match * * f , the chain of information cell is extend from * * f by store the address of the next available cell in the y-region , * * f , in * * f . 
the cell * * f become the second information cell in the chain and is assign as the information cell of * * f . 
a third cell can be add by store the address of another y-cell in * * f ; similarly , as many cell are add as are require . 
each information cell in the chain contain the address of the y-cell where the form to which it is assign is store . 
each cell except the last in the chain also contain the address of the y-cell that be the next element of the chain ; the absence of such a link in the last cell indicate the end of the chain . 
hence , when the address * * f is compute from * * f , the cell * * f and all y-cells in its chain must be inspect to determine whether * * f be already in the form list or whether it should be add to the form list and the chain . 
when the information cell for * * f has been determine , it is save as a representation of * * f . 
text reading continue with the next occurrence . 
text reading is terminate when a predetermined number of form have been store in the text form list . 
this initiate the second step of glossary lookup - connect the information cell of form in the text form list to dictionary form . 
each form represent by the dictionary is look_up in the text form list . 
each time a dictionary form match a text form , the information cell of the matching text form is save . 
the number of dictionary form skip since the last one match is also save . 
these two piece of information for each dictionary form that is match by a text form constitute the table of dictionary usage . 
if each text form is mark when match with a dictionary form , the text form not contain in the dictionary can be identify when all dictionary form have been read . 
the appropriate action for handle these form can be take at that time . 
each dictionary form is look_up in the text form list by the same method use to look_up a new text occurrence in the form list during text reading . 
a random address * * f that lie within the x-region of memory mention earlier is compute from the i-th dictionary form . 
if cell * * f be an information cell , it and any information cell in the y-region that have been link to * * f each contain an address in the w-region where a potentially matching form is store . 
the dictionary form is compare with each of these text form . 
when a match is find , an entry is make in the table of dictionary usage . 
if cell * * f be not an information cell we conclude that the i-th dictionary form be not in the text list . 
these two step essentially complete the lookup operation . 
the final step merely use the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that pertain to each form match in the text form list , and use the list of information cell record in text order to attach the appropriate information to each occurrence in text . 
the list of text form in the w-region of memory and the content of the information cell in the x and y-regions are no_longer require . 
only the assignment of the information cell be important . 
the first stage of translation after glossary lookup be structural analysis of the input text . 
the grammatical description of each occurrence in the text must be retrieve from the dictionary to permit such an analysis . 
a description of this process will serve to illustrate how any type of information can be retrieve from the dictionary and attach to each text occurrence . 
the grammatic description of all form in the dictionary are record in a separate part of the dictionary file . 
the order be identical to the ordering of the form they describe . 
when entry are being retrieve from this file , the table of dictionary usage indicate which entry to skip and which entry to store in the computer . 
this selection rejection process take_place as the file is read . 
each entry that is select for storage is write into the next available cell of the w-region . 
the address of the first cell and the number of cell use is write in the information cell for the form . 
( the address of the information cell is also supply by the table of dictionary usage . ) 
when the complete file has been read , the grammatic description for all text form find in the dictionary have been store in the w-region ; the information cell assign to each text form contain the address of the grammatic description of the form it represent . 
hence , the description of each text occurrence can be retrieve by read the list of text ordered information cell address and output the description indicate by the information cell for each occurrence . 
the only requirement on dictionary information make by the text lookup operation be that each form represent by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the form . 
this leave the ordering of entry variable . 
( here an entry be a form plus the information that pertain to it . ) 
two very useful way for modify a form dictionary be the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigm rather than single form and the application of a single change to more_than one dictionary form . 
the former is intend to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage . 
the latter be useful for modify information about some or all form of a word , hence reduce the work require to improve dictionary content . 
apply the technique develop at harvard for generate a paradigm from a representative form and its classification , we can add all form of a word to the dictionary at_once . 
an extension of the principle would permit enter a grammatic description of each form . 
equivalent could be assign to the paradigm either at the time it is add to the dictionary or after the word has been study in context . 
thus , one can think_of a dictionary_entry as a word rather than a form . 
if all form of a paradigm are group together within the dictionary , a considerable reduction in the amount of information require be possible . 
for_example , the inflected form of a word can be represent , insofar as regular inflection allow , by a stem and a set of ending to be attach . 
( indeed , the set of ending can be replace by the name of a set of ending . ) 
the full form can be derive from such information just prior to the lookup of the form in the text form list . 
similarly , if the equivalent for the form of a word do not vary , the equivalent need be enter only once with an indication that they apply to each form . 
the dictionary system be in_no_way dependent upon such summarization or design around it . 
when irregularity and variation prevent summarize , information is write in complete detail . 
entry are summarize only_when by do so the amount of information retain in the dictionary is reduce and the time require for dictionary operation is decrease . 
in sentence , pattern of stress are determine by complex combination of influence that can only be suggest here . 
the tendency be toward put dominant stress at the end . 
there is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long known hymn tune . 
thus the first line of one of person 's hymn be as_follows . 
`` a charge to keep i have , a god to glorify '' . 
in the tune to which this hymn be most often sing , `` boylston '' , the syllable have and fy , end their line , have twice the time any other syllable have . 
dominant stress be of_course more than extended duration , and normally center_on syllable that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the word or long unit they be part of be speak alone : a dominant stress give to glorify would normally center_on its first syllable rather than its last . 
but the parallel be significant . 
when the answer to what be wrong now ? 
be person 's break a chair , dominant stress will usually be on the complement a chair . 
from the point_of_view of syntactic analysis the head word in the statement be the predicator has break , and from the point_of_view of meaning it would seem that the trouble center in the breaking ; but dominant stress will be assign to break only in rather exceptional version of the sentence . 
in i know one thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing ; in one thing i know it will usually be on the predicator know . 
in small_town people be very friendly dominant stress will generally be on the complement very friendly ; in the double sentence the small the town , the friendly the people it will generally be on the subject the town and the people . 
in what be a linguist ? 
dominant stress will generally be on the subject a linguist ; in who be a linguist ? 
it will generally be on the complement a linguist . 
dominant stress be on her luggage both in that be her luggage , where her luggage be the complement , and in there be her luggage , where it be the subject . 
adverbial second complement , however , be likely not to have dominant stress when they terminate sentence . 
if the answer to what was that noise ? 
be person put the cat out , dominant stress will ordinarily be on the first complement , the cat , not the second complement out . 
final adjunct may or may not have dominant stress . 
if the answer to what be that noise ? 
be person read the news emotionally , dominant stress may or may not be on the adjunct emotionally . 
when prepositional complement are divide as in what are you look_for ? 
they be likely to lose dominant stress . 
context be of extreme importance . 
what be new in the context be likely to be make more prominent than what be not . 
thus in a context in which there has be discussion of snow but mention of local condition be new , dominant stress will probably be on here in it rarely snow here , but in a context in which there has be discussion of local weather but no mention of snow , dominant stress will probably be on snow . 
the personal_pronoun and substitute one be normally unstressed because they refer to what be prominent in the immediate context . 
in i 'll go_with person dominant stress be probably on person ; but if person has just been mention prominently ( and the trip to be make has be under discussion ) , what is say be probably i 'll go_with him , and dominant stress be probably on the preposition with . 
when a gesture accompany who 's he ? 
the personal_pronoun have dominant stress because `` he '' has not been mention previously . 
if both person and a piece of information person does not have be prominent in the context , but the idea of tell person be new , then dominant stress will probably be on tell in why not tell person ? 
but when what be new in a particular context be also fairly obvious , there be normally only light stress or no stress at_all . 
thus the unstressed it of it rarely snow here get its significance from its use with snow : nothing can snow snow but `` it '' . 
in there are n't many young people in the neighborhood the modifier young take_away dominant stress away from its head people : the fact that the young creature of interest be people seem rather obvious . 
if woman replace people , it would normally have dominant stress . 
in i have thing to do the word thing make little real contribution to meaning and have weak stress than do . 
if work be substitute for thing ( with more exact contribution to meaning ) , it will have dominant stress . 
in i know one thing dominant stress be likely to go to one rather than to semantically pale thing . 
in i know you when you be a child , and you be pretty then dominant stress on then imply that the young_woman speak_to be still pretty . 
dominant stress on pretty would be almost insulting here . 
in the written_language then can be underline or italicize to guide the reader here , but much of the time the written_language simply depend_on the reader 's alertness , and a careless reader will have to back_up and reread . 
often dominant stress simply indicate a centering of attention or emotion . 
thus in it be incredible what that boy can eat dominant stress be likely to be on incredible , and eat will have strong stress also . 
in she has_it_in_for person dominant stress will ordinarily be on in , where the notion of stored_up antipathy seem to center . 
in we 're paint at our garage strong stress on at indicate that the job being do be not real painting but simply an effort at painting . 
where there be comparison or contrast dominant stress normally operate to center attention . 
thus in his friend be strange than his sister ' strong stress be normal for his and sister ' , but in his friend be strange than his sister strong stress be normal for friend and sister . 
in he 's hurt himself more_than he 's hurt you both himself and you have strong stress than they would ordinarily have if there be no contrast . 
in be she chinese or japanese ? 
the desire to contrast the first part of word which be alike in their last component produce an exceptional disregard of the normal pattern of stress of chinese and japanese . 
sometimes strong stress serve to focus an important secondary relationship . 
thus in person write an account of the trip first strong stress on person mark person as the first in a series of people who write account of the trip , strong stress on write mark the writing as the first of a series of action of person 's concern with an account of her trip ( about which she may later have make speech , for_example ) , and strong stress on trip make the trip the first of a series of subject about which person write account . 
in hunger stimulate man too the situation be very similar . 
strong stress on hunger treat hunger as an additional stimulus , strong stress on stimulate treat stimulation as an additional effect of hunger , strong stress on man treat man as an additional creature who respond to the stimulation of hunger . 
here again , in the written_language it be possible to help the reader get his stress right by use underline or italic , but much of the time there is simply reliance on his understanding in the light of context . 
when a word represent a larger construction of which it be the only expressed part , it normally have more stress than it would have in fully express construction . 
thus when yes , i have be the response to have you finish read the paper ? 
the stress on have , which here represent have finish read the paper , be quite strong . 
in person be the leader at camp , but person be here the be of the second main declarative represent be the leader and therefore have stress . 
person be the leader at camp , but person be here , with this be deprived_of stress , make here the complement in the clause . 
in of all the suggestion that were make , his be the silly the possessive his represent his suggestion and be stress . 
when go represent itself and a complement ( be equivalent_to , say , to go_to location ) in which boat did person go on ? 
it have strong stress ; when it represent only itself and on which be its complement ( so that go on be semantically equivalent_to board ) , on have strong stress than go does . 
omission of a subordinator pronoun , however , does not result in an increase in stress on a prepositional adverb for which the subordinator pronoun would be object . 
thus to have light stress both in that be the conclusion that i come to and in that be the conclusion i come to . 
but when to represent to consciousness in that be the moment that i come_to , and similarly in that be the moment i come_to , there be much strong stress on to . 
in i want to tell him , but i be afraid to the final to be lightly stress because it represent to tell him . 
in to tell him , of_course , to be normally unstressed . 
when i have instruction to leave be equivalent in meaning to i have instruction that i am to leave this place , dominant stress be ordinarily on leave . 
when the same sequence be equivalent in meaning to i have instruction which i am to leave , dominant stress be ordinarily on instruction . 
it is clear that pattern of stress sometimes show construction unambiguously in the spoken_language where without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the written . 
other example follow . 
`` i 'll come by tuesday . 
i can n't be happy long without drinking water '' . 
in the first of these sentence if by be the complement of come and tuesday be an adjunct of time equivalent_to on tuesday , there will be strong stress on by in the spoken_language ; but if a complement for come is imply and by tuesday be a prepositional unit use as an adjunct , by will be unstressed or lightly stress at_most . 
in the second sentence if drink water be a gerundial clause and without drinking water be roughly equivalent_to in meaning to unless i drink water , there will be strong stress on water than on drink ; but if drinking be a gerundial noun modify water and without drinking_water be equivalent_to without water for drinking , there will be strong stress on drinking than on water . 
but the use of stress in comparison and contrast , for_example , can undermine distinction such_as these . 
and pattern of stress be not always unambiguous by_any_means . 
in the person have busy life without visit relative only context can indicate whether visit relative be equivalent in meaning to paying visit to relative or to relative who are visit them , and in i look_up the number and i look up the chimney only the meaning of number and chimney make it clear that up be syntactically a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition follow by its object in the second . 
- syllable be linguistic_unit center in peak which be usually vocalic but , as has been note , be consonantal under certain circumstance , and which may or may not be combine with preceding and / or following consonant or combination of consonant . 
syllable be genuine unit , but division of word and sentence into them present great difficulty . 
sometimes even the number of syllable be not clear . 
doubt on this point be strong before / l / and / / or / r / . 
from the point_of_view of word formation real might be expect to have two syllable . 
historically re be the formative that is employ also in republic , and al be the common suffix . 
when ity is add , real clearly have two syllable . 
but there is every reason to regard deal as a monosyllable , and because of the fact that / l / commonly have the quality of / / when it follow vowel_sound , deal seem to be a perfectly satisfactory rhyme with real . 
it be obvious enough that linguist in_general have be less successful in cope_with tone_system than with consonant or vowel . 
no single explanation be adequate_to account_for this . 
improvement , however , be urgent , and at_least three thing will be needed . 
the first be a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analysis . 
even beginning student in linguistics are make familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant_system , both in their general outline and in many specific detail . 
an advanced student has read a considerable number of description of consonantal_system , include some of the more unusual type . 
by contrast , even experienced linguist commonly know no_more of the range of possibility in tone_system than the oversimplified distinction between register_language and contour_language . 
this limited familiarity with the possible phenomenon has severely hamper work with tone . 
tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory until a more representative selection of system be familiar to every practicing field linguist . 
papers like these four , if widely read , will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work . 
the second need be better field technique . 
the great majority of present-day linguist fall_into one or more of a number of overlapping type : those who be convinced that tone cannot be analyse , those who be personally scared of tone and tone_language generally , those who be convinced that tone be merely an unnecessary marginal feature in those language where it occur , those who have no idea how to proceed with tone analysis , those who take a simplistic view of the whole matter . 
the result has be neglect , fumbling effort , or superficial treatment . 
as these malady overlap , so must the cure . 
analysis such_as these four will simultaneously combat the assumption that tone be impossible and that it be simple . 
they will give suggestion that can be work_up into field procedure . 
good field technique will not_only equip linguist for better work , but also help them overcome negative attitude . 
actually , none of these papers say much directly about field technique . 
but it be worth ponder that very little has been publish on any phase of field technique in linguistics . 
these thing have been disseminate by other means , but always in the wake of extensive publication of analytic result . 
the third need be for better theory . 
we should expect that general phonologic theory should be as adequate for tone as for consonant and vowel , but it has not be . 
this can only be for one of two reason : either the two be quite different and will require totally different theory ( and hence technique ) , or our existing theory be insufficiently general . 
if , as i suspect , the problem be largely of the second sort , then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystem . 
one issue that must be face be the relative difficulty of analysis of different phonologic subsystem . 
since tone_system typically comprise fewer unit than either consonant_system or vowel_system , we might expect that they would be the easy part of a phonologic analysis . 
actual practice does not often work_out this way . 
tone_system be certainly more complex than the number of unit would suggest , and often analytically more difficult than much larger consonantal_system . 
person has suggest one explanation . 
tone_language use for linguistic contrast speech parameter which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use . 
this may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion for the more knowledgeable . 
the problem be to disentangle the linguistic feature of pitch from the cooccurring nonlinguistic feature . 
of_course , something of the same sort occur with other sector of the phonology : consonantal articulation have both a linguistic and an individual component . 
but in_general the individual variation be a small thing add onto basic linguistic feature of greater magnitude . 
with tone , individual difference may be greater than the linguistic contrast which are superimpose on them . 
pitch difference from one speaker to another , or from one emotional_state to another , may far exceed the small difference between tone . 
however , any such suggestion account_for only some of the difficulty in hear tone , or in develop a realistic attitude about tone , but not for the analytic difficulty that occur even when tone is meticulously record . 
a second explanation is suggest by the material describe in person ' paper . 
tone and intonation often become seriously intermeshed . 
neither can be adequately systematize until we be able to separate the two and assign the observed phenomenon individually to one or the other . 
other pair of phonologic subsystem also interact or overlap in this way ; for_example , duration sometimes figure in both the vowel_system and the intonation . 
some phonetic feature , for_example glottal_catch or murmur , are sometimes to be assign to segmental phonemics and sometimes to accentual_system . 
but no other two phonologic_system be as difficult to disentangle as are tone and intonation in some language . 
this explanation of tone difficulty , however , does not apply in all language . 
in some ( the ewe type mention above ) interaction of tone and intonation be restricted to the end of intonation span . 
in many of the syllable , intonation can be safely ignore , and much of the tonal analysis can be do without any study of intonation . 
still , even in such language tone analysis has not be as simple as one might expect . 
a third explanation is suggest by person 's analysis of sukuma tone . 
there we see a basically simple phonemic_system enmesh in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic_system . 
while the phoneme can be very easily state , no one be likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrence can be relate in_some_way to morphemic unit , i.e. until the morphophonemics is work_out , or at_least far enough that it seem reasonable to expect success . 
in the `` typical tone_language '' , tonal morphophonemics be of the same order of complexity as consonantal morphophonemics . 
the phonemic_system which must support these morphophonemic_system , however , be very different . 
the inventory of tone be much smaller , and commonly the contrast range along one single dimension , pitch level . 
consonantal_system be not merely larger , they be multidimensional . 
morphophonemic rule may be think_of as join certain point in the system . 
the possibility in the consonantal_system be very numerous , and only a small portion of them are actually use . 
phoneme connected by a morphophonemic rule commonly show a good bit of phonetic similarity , possible because of the several dimension of contrast in the system . 
tonal morphophonemics , in a common case , can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone . 
the possibility be few , and the total number of rule may be considerably greater . 
often , therefore , there be a number of rule have the same effect , and commonly other set of rule as_well , have the opposite effect . 
tonal morphophonemics be much more confusing to the beginning analyst than consonantal morphophonemics , even when the total number of rule be no greater . 
the difficulty of analysis of any subsystem in the phonology be an inverse_function of the size - smaller system be more troublesome - for any given degree of morphophonemic complexity . 
this hypothesis will account_for a large part of the difficulty of tonal analysis , as well as the fact that vowel_system be often more puzzling than consonantal_system . 
the statement of the system be a different matter . 
smaller system can of_course be state much more succinctly . 
a phonemic_system can be state without reference_to morphophonemics , but it cannot always be find without morphophonemics . 
and the more complex the morphophonemic_system be in_relation_to the phonemic base , the less easily a phonemic_system will be analyse without close attention to the morphophonemics - at_least , the less satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be relate through morphophonemic rule to grammatically meaningful structure . 
the design of orthography has receive much less attention from linguist than the problem deserve . 
there has be a tendency on the part of many american linguist to assume that a phonemic transcription will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only real problem will then be the social one of secure acceptance . 
this seem naive . 
most others have be content to give only the most general attention to the broad and most obvious feature of the phonology when design orthography . 
apparently the feeling be that anything more would be involvement in technical abstruseness of possible pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affair . 
the result of this attitude has be the domination of many orthography conference by such consideration as typographic ' esthetic ' , which usually turn_out to be nothing more than certain prejudice carry_over from european language . 
many_of the suggested system seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structure that they purport to represent . 
linguist have not always be more enlightened than `` practical people '' and sometimes have insist on incredibly trivial point while neglect thing of much greater significance . 
as a result , many people have been confirm in their conviction that orthography design be not an activity to which expert can contribute anything but confusion . 
person , in vowel-length_and_syllabicity_in_kikuyu , examine one set of related orthographic question and its phonologic background in_detail . 
his objective be merely to determine `` what distinction of length and syllabicity it may be desirable to make explicit in a kikuyu orthography '' ( 59 ) . 
to do so , he find it necessary to examine the relevant part of the phonology thoroughly and in_detail . 
in the process , he develop some very significant observation about problem of a sort that be often difficult . 
a_few of his example be of very great interest , and the whole discussion of some importance for theory . 
his orthographic recommendation be no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on_the_one_hand or of superficiality on the other . 
rather he weigh each phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic usefulness . 
he conclude that some change can make in the current orthography which will appreciably improve its usefulness , but hesitate to suggest precise graphic device to effect these change . 
i hope his suggestion are give the consideration they deserve in kikuyu circle . 
this , however , will not exhaust their practical usefulness , as they rather clearly indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography design . 
we need many_more study of this sort if the design of written_language is to be put on a sound basis . 
one other paper deal with a phonologic problem : 
vowel_harmony_in_igbo , by person . 
this restate the already widely known fact in_terms_of prosody . 
as a restatement it make only a small contribution to knowledge of igbo . 
but it would seem more intended as a tract advocate the prosodic theory than a paper direct to the specific problem of igbo phonology . 
the paper have a certain value as a comparatively easy introduction to this approach , particularly since it treat a fairly simple and straightforward phenomenon where it be possible to compare it with a more traditional ( though not structural ) statement . 
it does show one feature of the system that has not been previously describe . 
but it does not , as it claim , demonstrate that this could not be treat by traditional method . 
it seem to me that it rather easily can . 
five of the papers deal with grammatical problem . 
on_the_whole they maintain much the same high standard , but they be much more difficult to discuss in_detail because of their wide variety of subject_matter . 
my comment must be brief than the papers deserve . 
person write_on the_verbal_radical_in_iraqw . 
this must be consider primarily an amendment and supplement to his early a_short_description_of_item-categories_in_iraqw . 
it exhibit much the same descriptive technique and be open to much the same criticism . 
the treatment seem unnecessarily loose-jointed and complex , largely because the method be lax and the analysis seem never to be push to a satisfactory or even a consistent stopping_point . 
there be more stem per item in athabascan , which express the fact that the athabascan language have undergo somewhat more change in diverge from proto athabascan than the yokuts language from proto yokuts . 
this may be because the athabascan divergence begin earlier ; or again because the athabascan language spread over a very_much larger territory ( include three wholly separated area ) ; or both . 
the differentiation however be not very_much greater , as show by the fact that athabascan show 3.46 stem per meaning slot as against 2.75 for yokuts , with a slightly greater number of language represent in our sample : 24 as against 21 . 
( on deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem / item rate become 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of language . ) 
these general fact are mention to make clear that the total situation in the two family be similar enough to warrant comparison . 
the great difference in the two set of figure be_due to difference in the two set of list use . 
these difference in_turn result from the fact that my yokuts vocabulary were build_up of term select mainly to insure unambiguity of english meaning between illiterate informant and myself , within a compact and uniform territorial area , but that person 's vocabulary be based_on person 's second glottochronological list which aim at eliminate all item which might be culturally or geographically determine . 
person in_short was try to develop a basic list that be universal ; i , one that was specifically adapt to the location . 
the result be that i include 70 animal name , but person only 4 ; and somewhat similarly for plant , 16 as against 4 . 
person , and therefore person , feel compelled to omit all term denote species or even genus ( fox , vulture , salmon , yellow_pine , manzanita ) ; their class of animal and plant term are restrict to generalization or recurrent part ( fish , bird , tree , grass , horn , tail , bark , root ) . 
the group be therefore really non comparable in content as_well as in size . 
other class are include only by myself ( interrogative , adverb ) or only by person and person ( pronoun , demonstrative ) . 
what we have left as reasonably comparable be four class : ( 1 ) body_part and product , which with a proportionally nearly even representation ( 51 term out of 253 , 25 out of 100 ) come_out with nearly even ratio ; 2.6 and 2.7 ; ( 2 ) nature ( 29 term against 17 ) , ratio 3.3 versus 4.1 ; ( 3 ) adjective ( 16 , 15 term ) , ratio 3.9 versus 4.7 ; ( 4 ) verb ( 9 , 22 term ) , ratio 4.0 versus 3.4 . 
it will be see that where the scope be similar , the athabascan ratio come_out somewhat high ( as indeed they ought to with a total ratio of 2.8 as against 3.5 or 4 : 5 ) except for verb , where alone the athabascan ratio be low . 
this exception may be connected with person 's use of a much higher percentage of verb : 
22  of his total list as against 3.5  in mine . 
or the exception may be_due to a particular durability peculiar to the athabascan verb . 
more word_class ratio determine in more language will no_doubt ultimately answer the question . 
if word_class differ in their resistance or liability to stem replacement within meaning slot , it be conceivable that individual meaning also differ with fair consistence trans lingually . 
person 's athabascan and my yokuts share 71 identical meaning ( with allowance for several near synonym like stomach belly , big large , long far , many much , die dead , say speak ) . 
for yokuts , i tabulate these 71 item in five column , according_as they were express by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and more_than 4 stem . 
the total for these five category be not too uneven , namely 20 , 15 , 11 , 16 , 9 respectively . 
for athabascan , with a greater range of stem , the first two of five corresponding column be identical , 1 and 2 stem ; the three others had to be spread somewhat , and are headed respectively * * f ; * * f ; and * * f stem . 
while the particular limit of these grouping may seem artificially arbitrary ; they do fairly express a corresponding grouping of more variable material , and they eventuate also in five class , along a similar scale , contain approximately equal number of case , namely 19 , 14 , 15 , 11 , 12 in athabascan . 
when now we count the frequency of the 71 item in the two language family appear in the same column or grade , or one column or grade apart , or two or three or four , we find these difference : * * f this distribution can be summarize by average the distance in grade apart : * * f ; which , divide by * * f give a mean of 1.07 grade apart . 
if the distribution of the 71 item be wholly concordant in the two family , the distance would of_course be 0 . 
if it be wholly random and unrelated , it would be 20 , assume the five class be equal in n , which approximately they be . 
the actual mean of 1.07 be about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 20 of no correlation , it be evident that there be a pretty fair degree of similarity in the behavior even of particular individual item of meaning as regard long-term stem displacement . 
in 1960 , person publish basic vocabulary in some mon-khmer language al 2 , no. 3 , pp. 7 - 11 ) , which compare 8 mon-khmer language with the i-e language data on which person base the revised retention rate ( * * f ) in_place_of original ( * * f ) , and his revised 100 word basic glottochronological list in towards_greater_accuracy ( ijal_21_:_121_-_137 ) . 
person ' finding be , first , `` that the individual item vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence '' ; but , second , `` that the semantic group be surprisingly unvarying in their average persistence '' ( as between m-k and i-e . 
his first conclusion , on behavior of individual item , be negative , whereas mine ( on ath. and yok . ) be partially positive . 
his second conclusion , on semantic word_class , agree with mine . 
this second conclusion , independently arrive at by independent study of material from two pair of language family as different and remote from one another as these four be , cannot be ignore . 
person also present a simple equation for derive an index of persistence , which weight not_only the number of stem ( ' root ' ) per meaning , but their relative_frequency . 
thus his persistence value for some stem frequency per meaning be : stem identical in 8 language , 100  ; stem frequency 7 and 1 , 86  ; stem frequency 4 and 4 , 64  ; stem frequency 4 , 3 , and 1 , 57  . 
his formula will have to be weigh , may be alter or improve , and it should be test on additional body of material . 
but consideration of the frequency of stem per constant meaning seem to be establish as have significance in comparative situation with diachronic and classificatory relevance ; and person presumably be on_the_way with a further contribution in this area . 
as to relative_frequency of competing root ( 7 - 1 vs. 4 - 4 , etc. ) , person with his ' weighting ' seem to be the first to have consider the significance this might have . 
the problem need further exploration . 
i be at_least conscious of the distinction in my full yokuts presentation that await publication , in which , in list ' two_stem_meanings ' , i set_off by asterisk those form in which n of stem b be * * f of stem a_3 , the unasterisked ones stand_for * * f ; or under ' four_stems ' , i set_off by asterisk case where the combined n of stem * * f be * * f . 
these finding , and_others which will in_time be develop , will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry . 
if adjectival meaning show relatively low retentiveness of stem , as i be confident will prove to be the case in most language of the world , why should our basic list include 15 percent of these unstable form , but only 8 percent of animal and plant which replace much more slowly ? 
had person substitute for his 15 adjectival slot 15 good animal and plant item , his rate of stem replacement would have be low and the age of athabascan language separation smaller . 
and irrespective of the outcome in century elapse since split , calculation obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable unit than with variously unstable ones . 
it be evident that person has not_only have much experience with basic vocabulary in many language but has acquire great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior of lexical item . 
why then this urge to include unstable item in his basic list ? 
it be the urge to obtain a list as free_of geographical and cultural conditioning as possible . 
and why that insistence ? 
it be the hope of attain a list of item of universal occurrence . 
but it is become increasingly evident that such a hope be a snare . 
not that such a list cannot be construct ; but the nearer it comes_to attain universality , the less significant will it be linguistically . 
its term will tend to be labile or vague , and they will fit actual language more_and_more badly . 
the practical operational problem of lexicostatistics be the establishment of a basic list of item of meaning against which the particular form or term of language can be match as the medium of comparison . 
the most important quality of the meaning be that they should be as definable as possible . 
in proportion as meaning be concrete , we can better rely_on their be insulate and distinctive . 
an elephant or a fox or a swan or a coco_palm or a banana possess in unusually high degree this quality of obvious , commonsense , indubitable identity , as do an eye or tooth or nail . 
they isolate out easily , naturally , and unambiguously from the continuum of nature and existence ; and they should be give priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these quality . 
with the universal list as his weapon , person has extend his march of conquest farther and farther into the past , eight , ten , twelve millennium back . 
and he has proclaim greater or less affiliation between all western_hemisphere language . 
some of_this may prove to be true , or even considerable of_it , whether by genetic ramification or by diffusion and coalescence . 
but the farther out he move , the thin will be his hold on conclusive evidence , and the larger the speculative component in his inference . 
he has traverse province and kingdom , but he has not consolidate them behind him , nor does he control them . 
he has announce result on hokan , penutian , uto-aztecan , and almost all other american family and phylum , and has diagram their degree of interrelation ; but he has not work_out by lexicostatistics one comprehensively complete classification of even a single family other_than salish . 
that be his privilege . 
the remote , cloudy , possible have value of its own - value of scope , stimulus , potential , and imagination . 
but there be also a firm aspect to lexicostatistics : 
the aspect of learn the internal organization of obvious natural genetic group of language as_well as their more remote and elusive external link ; of classification first , with elapsed age merely a by-product ; of acquire evidential knowledge of what happen in athabascan , in yokuts , in uto-aztecan in the last few thousand year as_well as forecast what more anciently may have happen between them . 
this involve step-by-step progress , and such will have to be the day_by_day work of lexicostatistics as a growing body of scientific inquiry . 
if of the founder of glottochronology person has escape our steady plodding , and person has repudiate his own share in the founding , that be no reason why we should swerve . 
there is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by person 's rule and procedure since his predilection and aim have grow so vast . 
it seem time to consider a revision of operational procedure for lexicostatistic study on a more humble , solid , and limited basis . 
i would propose , first , an abandonment of attempt at a universal lexical list , as intrinsically unachievable , and operationally inadequate in proportion as it is achieve . 
i would propose , next , as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic list , item whose form show as high an empirical retention rate as possible . 
there would be no conceivable sense in go_to the opposite extreme of select item whose form be the most unstable . 
an attempted middle course might lead to device like a 5000 - word alphabetize dictionary from which every fiftieth word was select . 
unemployed older worker who have no expectation of secure employment in the occupation in which they be skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future . 
some vocational training_school provide such training , but the current need exceed the facility . 
the present federal program of vocational education begin in 1917 with the passage of the smith-hughes_act , which provide a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a match basis , state administer program of vocational education in agriculture , trade , industrial skill and home_economics . 
since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related act have extend this federal program . 
the george-barden_act of 1946 raise the previous increase in annual authorization to $ 29 million in_addition to the $ 7 million under the smith_act . 
the health_amendment_act of 1956 add $ 5 million for practical_nurse training . 
the latest major change in this program was introduce by the national_defense_education_act of 1958 , title 8 , of which amend the george-barden_act . 
annual authorization of $ 15 million were add for area vocational education program that meet national defense need for highly skilled technician . 
the federal program of vocational education merely provide financial_aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education program in public school . 
the initiative , administration and control remain primarily with the local school district . 
even the state remain primarily in an assist role , provide leadership and teacher training . 
federal assistance is limit to half of the total expenditure , and the state or local district must pay at_least half . 
the state may decide to encourage local program by pay half of the cost , or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it . 
throughout the history of the program , state_government expenditure in the aggregate have usually match or exceed the federal expenditure , while local district all_together have spend more_than either federal or state_government . 
today , federal funds account_for only one-fifth of the nation 's expenditure for vocational education . 
the greatest impact of the match fund principle has be in initially encourage the poor state and school district to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds . 
national defense consideration have be the major reason behind most federal training expenditure in recent decade . 
during world_war 2 , about 7.5 million person were enroll in course organize under two special program administer by state and local school authorities : ( 1 ) vocational education for national defense , and ( 2 ) war production training . 
the total cost of the five year program be $ 297 million . 
for the smith-hughes , george-barden , and national_defense_act of 1958 , the cumulative total of federal expenditure in 42 year be only about $ 740 million . 
no comparable measure be available of enrollment and expenditure for private vocational education training . 
there be a great number and variety of private commercial school , trade_school and technical_school . 
in_addition , many large corporation operate their own formal training_program . 
a recent study indicate that 85 percent of the nation 's largest corporation conduct educational program involve some class meeting and examination . 
most skilled_worker industrial workers , nevertheless , still acquire their skill outside of formal training institution . 
the group of group has estimate that three out of five skilled_worker and one out of five technician have not been formally train . 
there be little doubt that the student benefit from vocational education . 
employer prefer to hire youth with such training rather_than those without , and most graduate of vocational training go to work in job related to their training . 
vocational educator do not claim that school training alone make skilled_worker , but it provide the essential groundwork for develop skill . 
in most state , trade and industrial training is provide in a minority of the high_school , usually located in the larger city . 
in arkansas fewer than 6 percent of the high_school offer trade and industrial course . 
in illinois about 13 percent of the school have program , and in pennsylvania 11 percent . 
an important recent trend be the development of area vocational_school . 
for a number of year kentucky , louisiana and several other state have been build state sponsor vocational education school that serve nearby school district in several county . 
these school are intend to provide the facility and specialized curriculum that would not be possible for very small school district . 
transportation may be provide from nearby school district . 
course are provide mainly for post high_school day program ; but sometimes arrangement also are make for high_school student to attend , and evening extension course also may be conduct . 
the title 8 , program of the national_defense_education_act of 1958 be a great spur to this trend toward area school . 
by 1960 there be such school in all but 4 state . 
they were operate in 10 of the 17 major area of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor area . 
an extension of this program into the other distressed area should be undertake . 
some of this trend toward area vocational_school has be related to the problem of persistent labor surplus area and their desire to attract new industry . 
the major training need of a new industrial plant be a short period of pre employment training for a large_number of semiskilled machine operator . 
a_few key skilled_worker experienced in the company 's type of work usually must be bring_in with the plant manager , or hire away from a similar plant elsewhere . 
a prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run advantage of training_program in the area to supply future skilled_worker and provide supplementary extension course for its employee . 
the existence of a public_school vocational training_program in trade and industry provide a base from which such need can be fill . 
additional course can readily be add and special cooperative program work_out with any new industry if the basic facility , staff and program be in being . 
thus , besides the training provide to youth in school , the existence of the school program can have supplementary benefit to industry which make it an asset to industrial development effort . 
few state make effective use of their existing vocational education program or funds for the purpose of attract new industry . 
the opportunity exist for state to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad_hoc flexible basis to subsidize any local preemployment_training_program that my be quickly set_up in a community to aid a new industrial plant . 
the major weakness of vocational training_program in labor surplus area be their focus on serve solely local job demand . 
this weakness be not unique to labor surplus area , for it be inherent in the system of local school district in this country . 
planning of vocational education program and course is orient to local employer need for trained_worker . 
all the manual for set_up vocational course stress the importance of first make a local survey of skill need , of estimate the growth of local job , and of consult with local employer on the type of course and their content . 
furthermore , there be a cautious conservatism on the part of those make local skill survey . 
local job can be see and count , while opportunity elsewhere are regard_as more hypothetical . 
while the u.s. department_of_labor have a program of project industry and occupational employment trend and publish current outlook statement , there be little tangible evidence that these projection have been use extensively in local curriculum planning . 
the u.s. group continue to stress local survey rather_than national survey . 
this procedure be extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus area with a long history of declining employment . 
elaborate study have been make in labor surplus area in_order to identify sufficient number of local job vacancy and future replacement need for certain skill to justify training_program for those skill . 
no effort is make in the same study to present information on regional or national demand trend in these skill or to consider whether regional or national demand for other skill might provide much better opportunity for the youth to be train . 
moreover , the current information on what type of training are need and possible be too limited and fragmentary . 
there simply be not enough material available on the type of job skill that be in_demand and the type of training_program that be required or most suitable . 
much of the available information come not from the federal_government but from an exchange of experience among state . 
state and local agency in the vocational education field must be encourage to adopt a wide outlook on future job opportunity . 
there be a need for an expanded federal effort to provide research and information to help guide state education department and local school_board in existing program . 
a related question be whether unemployed worker can be motivate to take the training provide . 
there be little evidence that existing public or private training_program have any great difficulty get student to enroll in their program , even though they must pay tuition , receive no subsistence payment , and are not guarantee a job . 
however , there always be some limit to the number who will spend the time and effort to acquire training . 
again , one major difficulty be the local focus . 
a training_program in a depressed area may have few enrollee unless there be some apparent prospect for better employment opportunity afterwards , and the prospect may be poor if the training is aim solely at job in the local community . 
if there be adequate information on job opportunity for skilled job elsewhere , many_more worker can be expect to respond . 
another problem be who will pay for the training . 
local school district be hard-pressed financially and unenthusiastic about vocational training . 
program usually are expand only when outside funds be available or local business_leader demand it . 
even industrial development leader find it hard to win local support for training unless a new industry be in_sight and request it . 
state_government have been take the lead in establish area vocational_school , but their focus be still on area job opportunity . 
only the federal_government be likely to be able to take a long-run and nationwide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower need . 
if only state funds were use to pay for the vocational education , it could be argue that the state should not have_to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employer in other state . 
however , if federal funds are use , it would be entirely appropriate to train worker for job which could be obtain elsewhere as_well_as for job in the area of chronic unemployment . 
such training would increase the tendency of worker to leave the area and find job in other locality . 
a further possibility is suggest by the example of the g._i. bill and also by some recent trend in attitude toward improve college education : that_is to provide financial assistance to individual for vocational training when local facility be inadequate . 
this probably would require some support for subsistence as_well_as for tuition , but the total would be no great than for the proposal of unemployment_compensation or a group . 
a maximum of $ 600 per_year per student would enable many to take training away from home . 
a program of financial assistance would permit place emphasis on the national interest in train highly skilled labor . 
instead of being limit to the poor training facility in remote area , the student would be able to move to large institution of concentrated specialized training . 
such specialized training institution could be located near the most rapidly grow industry , where the equipment and job experience exist and where the future employment opportunity be located . 
this would heighten possibility for part-time cooperative , on_the_job and extension training . 
personal financial assistance would enable more emphasis to be placed on the interest of the individual . 
his aptitude and preference could be give more weight in select the proper training . 
wage price policy of industry be the result of a complex of force - no single explanation has been find which apply to all case . 
the purpose of this paper be to analyze one possible force which has not been treat in the literature , but which we believe make a significant contribution to explain the wage price behavior of a_few very important industry . 
while there may be several such industry to which the model of this paper be applicable , the author make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wage and price in the steel industry of the united_states since world_war_ii , . 
indeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry 's attitude in the recent steel strike have a direct explanation in_terms_of the model here present . 
the model of this paper consider an industry which is not characterize by vigorous price_competition , but which be so basic that its wage price policy be hold in_check by continuous critical public scrutiny . 
where the industry 's product price has been keep below the `` profit-maximizing '' and `` entry limiting '' price due_to fear of public reaction , the profit seeking producer have an interest in offer little real resistance to wage demand . 
the contribution of this paper be a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implication . 
in_order_to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public limit price '' on `` key '' wage bargain , we deliberately simplify the model by abstract from other force , such_as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation . 
for expository purpose , this is best treat as a model which spell_out the condition under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wage even in the absence of union pressure for high wage . 
part 1 , below describe this abstract model by spell_out its assumption . 
part 2 , discuss the operation of the model and derive some significant conclusion . 
part 3 , discuss the empirical relevance and policy implication of the conclusion . 
part 4 , be a brief summary . 
the mathematical appendix present the rigorous argument , but is best read after part 1 , in_order that the assumption underlie the equation may be explicit . 
the industry with which this model be concerned be a basic industry , produce a substantial share of gross_national_product . 
price_competition be lacking . 
for the purpose of set the product price , the industry behave as a single entity . 
in wage negotiation , the industry bargain as a unit with a single union . 
we are concerned with aggregate demand for the industry 's product . 
the manner in which this is share among firm is take as given . 
in any given time_period , the aggregate demand for the industry 's product is determine by two thing : the price charge by the industry , and the level of gnp . 
for the purpose of this discussion , the problem of relative price be encompass in these two variable , since gnp include other price . 
( we abstract here from technological progress and assume that price of all other product change proportionately . ) 
the form of the industry demand function be one which make quantity demand vary inversely with the product price , and vary directly with the level of gnp . 
the industry of this model be so important that its wage and price policy are affect with a public interest . 
because of its importance , and because the lack of price_competition be well recognized , the industry be under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justify by cost increase . 
the threat of effective antitrust action , provoke by `` gouge the public '' through price increase not justify by cost increase , and fear of endanger relations with customer , congress , the general public and the press , all operate to keep price increase in some relation to cost increase . 
for the industry of this model , the effect of such public pressure in the past has be to hold the price well below the short-run profit maximize price ( given the wage rate and the level of gnp ) , and even below the entry limited price ( but not below average_cost ) . 
for such an industry , it be only `` safe '' to raise its price if such an increase is manifestly `` justify '' by rising cost ( due_to rising wage , etc . ) . 
thus , if public pressure set the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge , this pressure be itself a function of the wage rate . 
in this model , we abstract from all non wage source of cost change , so that the `` public limit price '' only rise as the wage rate rise . 
in such circumstance , it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate . 
since marginal_cost rise when the wage rate rise , the profit-maximizing price also rise when the public limit price is elevate , and be likely to remain well above the latter . 
the entry limiting price will also be raise for potential domestic competition , but unless general inflation permit profit_margin to increase proportionately throughout the economy , we might expect the public limit price to approach the entry limit price . 
the foreign entry limit price would be approach more rapidly , since domestic wage rate do not enter foreign cost directly . 
where this approach become critical , the industry can be expect to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its sincerity in `` resist '' the wage pressure of a powerful union , request tariff relief after it has `` reluctantly '' accede to the union pressure . 
whether or not it be in the industry 's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depend_upon the extent to which the public limit price rise in response to a basic wage increase , and the relation of this response to the increase in cost accompany the wage increase . 
the extent to which the public limit price is raise by a given increase in the basic wage rate be itself a function of three thing : the passage of time , the level of gnp , and the size of the wage increase . 
we are abstract from the fact of strike here , but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public limit price is raise by a given increase in the basic wage rate be also a function of the show of resistance put_up by the industry . 
the industry may deliberately take a strike , not to put pressure on the union , but in_order to `` educate '' the government and the customer of the industry . 
as a strike continue , these party increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement . 
they become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claim the wage bargain would entail . 
public indignation and resistance to wage price increase be obviously much less when the increase be on the order of 3  per_annum than when the increase be on the order of 3  per month . 
the simple passage of an additional eleven month ' time make the second 3  boost more acceptable . 
thus , the public limit price is raise further by a given wage increase the longer it has be since the previous price increase . 
notice , however , that the passage of time does not permit the raising of price per_se , without an accompanying wage increase . 
similarly , high level of gnp do not , in themselves , provide ground for raise price , but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise price high for a given wage increase . 
this is not extend to anticipated level of gnp , however - only the current level of gnp affect the public pressure against wage price increase . 
finally , since the public require some restraint on the part of the company , larger wage increase call_for less_than proportionately larger price increase ( e.g. , if a wage increase of 5  allow a price increase of 7  , a wage increase of 10  allow a price increase of something less_than 14  ) . 
we assume that average total unit_cost in the relevant region of operation be constant with_respect_to quantity produce ( the average_cost curve be horizontal , and therefore be identical with the marginal_cost curve ) , and be the same for every firm ( and therefore for the industry ) . 
the level of this average_cost is determine by factor price , technology , and_so_forth . 
as we have note , however , we are abstract from change in all determinant of this level except for change in the wage rate . 
the level of average_cost ( equal to marginal_cost ) be thus strictly a function of the wage rate . 
the single union which face the industry does not restrict its membership , and there be an adequate supply of labor available to the firm of the industry at the going wage rate . 
the union does not regard unemployment of its own member as a matter of concern when set its own wage policy - its concern with employment make itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment . 
the union vigorously demand wage increase from productivity increase , and wage increase to offset cost_of_living increase , but we abstract from these force here . 
for our present purpose we assume that the sole subject of bargaining be the basic wage rate ( not include productivity improvement factor or cost_of_living adjustment ) , and it be this basic wage rate which determine the level of cost . 
productivity be something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time_period be not even well_known to the industry , much_less to the union or to the public . 
disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbate the problem of agree how an increase in profit_margin related to a productivity increase should be share . 
the existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wage does not contradict the assumption that the union be willing to settle for cost_of_living and productivity share increase as distinct from a cost raising increase in the basic wage rate . 
we assume further that the union recognize the possibility that price level increase may offset wage rate increase , and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price increase arise from its own wage increase upon the `` real '' wage rate . 
for internal political reason , the union ask for ( and accept ) increase in the basic wage rate , and would vigorously oppose a reduction in this rate , but the adjustment of the basic wage rate upwards be essentially up_to the discretion of the company of the industry . 
change in the basic wage rate be cost raising , and they constitute an argument for raise price . 
however , it be not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is cause by a given change in the basic wage rate , although the company are presume to have reliable estimate of this magnitude . 
in this model , then , the industry is presume to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate , but since such a change be the only effective means to raise price they may , in circumstance to be spell_out in part 2 , below , find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise . 
thus , for non negative change in the basic wage rate , the industry become the active wage_setter , since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry acquiescence . 
the presumption in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be unchanged in this case , on the grounds that it be `` clearly '' not in the interest of the industry to raise wage gratuitously . 
from this presumption it be an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increase in the basic wage rate must be_due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assume in our model . 
it is this conclusion that we challenge ; we do so by disprove the presumption on which it is base . 
it be convenient to assume that the union industry contract be of one year 's duration . 
in the century from 1815 to 1914 the law_of_nations become international_law . 
several factor contribute to this change . 
the congress_of_vienna be a convenient starting_point because it both epitomize and symbolize what was to follow . 
here in 1815 the great nation assemble to legislate not merely for europe , but for the world . 
thus the congress mark a formal recognition of the political_system that be central to world politics for a century . 
international_law had to fit the condition of europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interest of the great european_nation collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense . 
essentially this impose two condition : first , international_law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political_system in which a number of state be competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignment with one another ; second , it had to be compatible with the value-system that they share . 
in both respect , international_law was europeanize . 
it be not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two condition . 
on_the_one_hand , the major european_nation had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty , independence , formal equality - thus insure for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of alignment '' that the system require and to avoid anything approach a repetition of the disastrous napoleonic experience . 
but there be no pressing need to maintain these same standard with regard_to most_of the rest of the world . 
thus , theory and doctrine applicable among the great nation and the small european state did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful society elsewhere . 
political interference in africa and asia and even in latin_america ( though limited in latin_america by the special interest of the united_states as express in the monroe_doctrine , itself from the outset related_to european politics and long dependent upon the `` balance_of_power '' system in europe ) be necessary in_order to preserve both common economic_value and the european `` balance_of_power '' itself . 
a nation such_as switzerland could be neutralize by agreement and could be rely_upon to protect its neutrality ; more doubtful , but possible , ( with an assist from the north ) be the neutralization of the latin-american country ; out_of_the_question be the neutralization of asia and africa . 
this europeanization of the law was make explicit by a number of 19th century scholar . 
more emphasis was put upon the fact that international_law be the law of `` civilized nation '' ; person and person , the great early american scholar , repeatedly made_use_of this phrase , or of `` christian nation '' , which be a substantial equivalent . 
person state that the public_law was essentially `` limit to the civilized and christian people of europe or to those of european origin '' . 
of_course it had always be of european origin in_fact , but it had maintain a universal outlook under the natural_law theory . 
now , with virtually every writer , not_only was the european origin of public_law acknowledge as a historical phenomenon , but the rule thus establish by the advanced civilization of europe were to be impose on others . 
the european custom on which international_law was base were to become , by force and fiat , the custom that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign state . 
person , for_example , be quite explicit on this point when he say `` state outside european civilization must formally enter into the circle of law govern country . 
they must do something with the acquiescence of the latter , or some of them , which amount to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction '' . 
during the nineteenth century these view were protest by virtually all the latin_american writer , though ineffectively , just as the new nation of africa and asia protest them , with more effect , today . 
a number of other nineteenth century development contribute to the transmutation of the law_of_nations into international_law ; that_is , from aspect of a universal system of justice into particular rule govern the relations of sovereign state . 
the difference be important , for although the old law_of_nations did cover relationship among sovereign , this be by_no_means its exclusive domain . 
the law of nature govern sovereign in their relationship to their own citizen , to foreigner , and to each other in a conceptually unified system . 
the theory of international_law , which in the nineteenth century become common to virtually all writer in europe and america , break this unity and this universality . 
it lose sight of the individual almost entirely and confine itself to rule limit the exercise of state power for reason essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations . 
no_longer did the sovereign look_to the law_of_nations to determine what he ought to do ; his search was merely for rule that might limit his freedom of action . 
to appreciate this development , we must relate it to other aspect of nineteenth century philosophy . 
first , and most obvious , be the grow nationalism and the tendency to regard the state , and the individual 's identification with the state , as transcend other tie of social solidarity . 
national identification be not new , but it was accelerate in intensity and scope throughout europe as new unification occur . 
it reach its ultimate philosophical statement in notion of `` state will '' put_forward by the german , especially by hegel , although political philosopher will recognize its origin in the rejected doctrine of person . 
national identification was reflect jurisprudentially in law theory which incorporate this hegelian abstraction and see law , domestic and international , simply as its formal reflection . 
in the international community this reduce law to person 's auto_limitation . 
a state , the highest form of human organization in fact and theory , could be subject to law only by a manifestation of self-will , or consent . 
according_to the new theory , the nineteenth century corporate sovereign be `` sovereign '' in a quite new and different sense from his historical predecessor . 
he no_longer seek to find the law ; he make it ; he could be subject to law only because he agree to be . 
there be no law , domestic or international , except that will by , acknowledge by , or consent to by state . 
hidden behind hegelian abstraction were more practical reason for a changing jurisprudence . 
related_to , but distinguishable from , nationalism was the growth of democracy in one form or another . 
increased participation in politics and the demand of various group for status and recognition have dramatic effect upon law institution . 
the effort of various interest group to control or influence governmental decision , particularly when take in conjunction with the impact of industrialization , lead to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby policy could be formulate and enforce as law through bureaucratic institution . 
law become a conscious process , something more than simply do justice and look_to local custom and a common morality for applicable norm . 
particularly be this true when the norm previously apply be no_longer satisfactory to many , when custom were rapidly change as the force of the new productivity were harness . 
the old way of doing thing , which depend_on a relatively stable community with stable idea deal with familiar situation , be no_longer adequate_to the task . 
first be the period of codification of exist law : the code_napoleon in france and the peculiar codification that , in_fact , result from person 's restatement and ordering of the common_law in england . 
codification was follow in all country by a growing amount of legislation , some change and adjust the old law , much deal with entirely new situation . 
the legislative mill have been grind ever since , and when its cumbersome process be no_longer adequate_to the task , a limited legislative authority was delegate in one form or another , to the executive . 
whereas the eighteenth century had be a time in which man seek justice , the nineteenth and twentieth have be century in which man be satisfied with law . 
indeed , with developed positivism , the separation of law from justice , or from morality generally , become quite specific . 
in municipal system we tend to view what be called positivism as fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increase the power of parliament - the elected representative - at the expense of the more conservative judiciary . 
when the power of the latter was make both limited and explicit - when norm were clarify and make more precise and the creation of new norm was place exclusively in parliamentary hands - two purpose were serve : government was make subservient to an institutionalized popular will , and law become a rational system for implement that will , for serve conscious goal , for embody the `` public policy '' . 
it be true that , initially , the task was to remove restriction that , it was think , inhibit the free flow of money , goods , and labor ; but even laissez_faire be a conscious policy . 
law was see as an emanation of the `` sovereign will '' . 
however , the sovereign be not person ' absolute monarch but rather the parliamentary sovereign of person . 
it be , too , an optimistic philosophy , and , though it separate law from morality , it be by_no_means an immoral or amoral one . 
man , through democratic institution of government and economic freedom , be master of his destiny . 
the theory did not require , though it unfortunately might acquire , a hegelian mystique . 
it be merely a rationalization and ordering of new institution of popular government . 
it be not opposed to either justice or morality ; it merely wish to minimize subjective view of official who wield public authority . 
particularly be this true as laissez-faire capitalism become the dominant credo of western society . 
to free the factor of production be a major objective of the rise bourgeoisie , and this objective require that governmental authority - administrative_official and judge - be limit as precisely and explicitly as possible ; that old custom which inhibit trade be abrogate ; that business be free from governmental supervision and notion of morality which might clog the automatic adjustment of the free market ; that obligation of status that be inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be do away with . 
contract - conceive as the free bargain of formal equal - replace the implied obligation of a more static and status conscious society . 
indeed , contract be the dominant legal theme of the century , the touchstone of the free society . 
government itself was base upon contract ; business_organization - the corporation - was analyze in contractual term ; trade was base on freedom of contract , and money was lend and borrow on contractual term ; even marriage and the family was see as a contractual arrangement . 
it be not surprising that the international obligation of state were also view in_terms_of contract . 
in_fact , some - person be the principal example - go so far as to say that all international_law could be trace to the single legal norm , pacta sunt servanda . 
the displacement ( at_least to a considerable extent ) of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth and eighteenth century by positivism reshape both international_law theory and doctrine . 
in_the_first_place the new doctrine bring a formal separation of international from municipal law , reject the early view that both be part of a universal legal_system . 
one result was to nationalize much that had been regard_as the law_of_nations . 
admiralty_law , the law_merchant , and the host of problem which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country were all sever from the old law_of_nations and make dependent_on the several national law . 
private international_law ( which american call the `` conflict of law '' ) was thus segregate from international_law proper , or , as it is often call , public international_law . 
state be free to enact , within broad though ( perhaps ) determinate limit , their own rule as_to the application of foreign law by their court , to vary the law_merchant , and to enact legislation with regard_to many claim arise on the high_sea . 
the change be not quite so dramatic as it sound because in_fact common norm continue to be invoke by municipal court and were only gradually change by legislation , and then largely in marginal situation . 
`` well '' - say person . 
`` i take a little time to think_over it over '' . 
it be awkward : very awkward . 
there would be all the nuisance of contact someone else to take_over . 
someone reasonably trustworthy . 
and person would hear about it . 
and person know - 
`` time '' , say person , and he smile very sweet and slow at person . 
`` not too much time , because i 'll be need some more myself pretty_much right_away . 
and i do favor for you , big favor not so long back , did n't i , and i be right here to take_on where person leave_off . 
no trouble . 
i do n't want no trouble , you do n't want no trouble , nobody want trouble , person '' . 
dear_heaven , no , think person , turn_away as another man come_in . 
he straighten his tie at the mirror with a shaking hand ; the genial smile seem painted on his face . 
person know - speak_of dangerous information ! 
person know too_much entirely already . 
really he have person at_bay . 
`` big favor i do you . 
of_course there 's this deal o ' person 's - and person 's - kinda hangin_'_fire , ai n't it , maybe you 've been kinda worry ' over that . 
and can n't say i blame you '' , say person thoughtfully . 
`` this deal with the ace o ' spade . 
anything to do with an ace o ' spade , bad_luck '' . 
ace_of_spades - a widow , that be what they call a widow , these low-class crook remember person distractedly . 
all about that person know , too . 
when thing get a_little out_of_hand , they very rapidly get a_lot out_of_hand - it seem to be a general rule . 
all just by_chance , and in_a_way trace back to poor person , all_of it , because naturally - brother , live together - and person - 
person did not at all like the look on person 's regular featured , almost girlishly good-looking face - or indeed anything about person . 
person be not a man who think very_much about moral_principle ; he find money much more interesting ; but all_the_same he think now , uneasily , of the way in which person earn his living - and pay for his own stuff - and eye the soft smile , and the spaniel like dark eye , and he feel a_little ill . 
`` look , my friend '' , he say , `` in my life i learn , how be it the proverb say , better an ounce of prevention to a pound of cure . 
i stay in business so long because i be careful . 
two_weeks , a month , we talk_over it over again , and maybe if nothing happen meanwhile to say the cop know this_and_that , then we make a little deal , is n't it '' ? 
`` that be a long while '' , say person . 
`` i tell you , you want to leave it that way , i do n't fool_around with it . 
i go over to person and get fix_up there . 
i can n't wait no two_weeks '' . 
and person did n't like person , but what with person and three of his boy inside , and not likely to come_out - and person such a valuable salesman , person say - all the nuisance and danger of get_in_touch with practically a whole new bunch of boy - why did everything have to happen at_once ? 
person say stupidly , `` why , you ai n't turn_down person down , are you , person ? 
i mean , we all figure - i guess anybody 'd figure - person '' - 
person give him an affectionate smile . 
`` person too smart a fellow want to get_rid_of me '' , he say . 
`` it 's o.k. , person , everything be o.k. be n't it , person '' ? 
oh , god , the name repeat over_and_over , anybody to hear - not be a fool , person know why . 
but aside from everything else , it would scarcely be pleasant to have dealings with one who be nominally an underling and actually hold - you could say - the whip_hand . 
and all because of person ! 
if person had dream of all the trouble that person would eventually cause - 
of_course , there was another factor . 
person worth his weight in gold right now , but these user , they sometimes go_down fast . 
who know , person might not last long . 
the sweat break_out on person ' forehead as he realize he had been actually think - hope - plan - perhaps - 
good_god_above , had not person be enough ? 
he pat person 's thin shoulder paternally . 
`` now you do n't want to go_on talk that way '' , he say . 
`` sure , sure , you be the one take_over for person , soon as i get the supply , get start up again , is n't it ? 
you do n't need worry , person . 
i tell you , i know how it be with you , my friend , i sympathize , and i 'll make it a special point - a special favor - get_in_touch , and get some stuff just for you . 
i do n't know if i can manage it tonight or tomorrow , but i 'll try my best , my friend . 
you see , you got to remember , we all get schedule , like any business ! 
my man , he won n't be around a little while , he just fix_up me up with this stuff they take_out of the group . 
it 's awkward , you see that , is n't it '' ? 
`` well , that be your business , person '' , say person , and his dreamy eye move past person ' shoulder to gaze vaguely out the ground_glass window . 
`` i appreciate it , you do that . 
sure . 
we do n't none of us want no trouble . 
i be in a room over the group on location , you just ask for me there , you want see me . 
or maybe i call you - tonight ? 
about nine o ' clock , i call and see if you get any . 
a couple deck for me , person - and ten twelve to sell , see , i like to have a little ready cash '' . 
`` oh , now , i do n't know about that much '' , say person . 
`` and you know , person , person , he always keep it a strict cash_basis , like they say '' - 
`` sure '' , say person . 
`` sure , person . 
fifty a throw , that the deal ? 
sure . 
i bring you the cash , say five_hundred for ten deck . 
never mind how much i cut it , how much i get '' , and he smile his sleepy smile again . 
`` standard deal , person . 
you go ' n ' have_a_look round for it '' . 
`` i do_one's_best my best '' , say person earnestly , `` just for you , my friend . 
this is awkward for everybody , is n't it , we all got to put_up with inconvenience sometimes . 
but i do_one's_best my best for you '' . 
he get_out of there in a hurry , brush past another man in the door , mop his brow . 
the expedient thing - yes , very true , one must make_do as one could , in some situation . 
it could all be straighten_out later . 
not very_much later , but when thing had settle_down a_little . 
after this deal with the person woman go_through . 
an ace_of_spades . 
he be not a superstitious man , but he feel perhaps there was a little something in_that , indeed . 
he rather wish he had never get_into the business , and still - scarcely to be resist , a nice little profit with not much work involve , easy_money . 
person , who would be person so very soon now , ring_up her first sale of the day and count back the change . 
she did not notice that the customer seize her purchase and turn_away without a smile or a word of thanks . 
usually she mark the few who did thank_you , you did n't get that kind much in a place like this : and she play a little game with herself , see how downright rude she could act to the others , before they 'd take offense , threaten to call the manager . 
funny how seldom they did : used_to it , probably . 
the kind who come into a cheap store like this ! 
grab , snatch , i see that first ! 
and , here , i 'll take this , i be before her , you wait_on me now or i do n't bother with it , see ! 
this kind of place . 
she 'd be through here , just no time at_all - leave this kind of thing ' way behind . 
off at noon , and she 'd never come_back . 
never have to . 
money - a_lot of money , enough . 
she 'd be smart about it , get him to give it to her in little bill so 's nobody would suspect - maybe could n't get it until monday account_of that , the bank - but that be n't really long to wait . 
not when she 'd wait so long already . 
no need say anything at_all to the old_woman . 
she had it all plan out , how she 'd do . 
she 'd say she did n't feel well on sunday , could n't go_to church - there 'd be a little argument , but she could be stubborn - and when the old_woman had go , quick pack the things she 'd need to take , all but the dress she 'd wear monday , and take the bag down to that place in the station where you could put things in a locker overnight , for a dime . 
then on monday morning - or it might have to be tuesday - get_up and leave just the usual time , and last thing , put the money in an envelope under the old_woman 's purse there in the drawer . 
she would n't be going_to get that for an hour or_so after person had leave , go do the daily shopping . 
no need leave a note with it , either - or maybe just something like , do n't worry about me , i 'm go_away to make a better life . 
a better life . 
escape . 
it was n't as if she want much . 
she did n't mind work hard , not as if she figure to do anything wrong to live easy and soft - all she want be a chance , where she was n't mark as what she be . 
to be person , and work in a nice shop somewhere , at a_little more money so she could have pretty clothes , and learn lady ' manners and all like that , and get to know different people than up_to_now , not just the ones like her here , with foreign sounding name , the ones go_to the same church and - different place , different job , different people , she 'd be all different too . 
pretty , she 'd do her hair another way ; smart , and wear different kind of clothes - she 'd be person , just what that sound like . 
`` you 've give me the wrong change '' , say the customer sharply . 
`` think i can n't count '' ? 
person make_up the amount in indifferent silence . 
she was listen to other voice , out of the future . 
some of those vaguely imagined new , different people . 
oh , person 's awfully nice , and pretty too , i like person . 
let 's ask person to go_with us , she be always a_lot fun . 
person . 
soon , very soon now & & & . 
person did n't wake until nearly nine thirty . 
it was going_to be another hot day ; already the thermometer stand close_to ninety . 
person be still sound asleep ; he make fresh coffee and search through all the desk drawer for more cigarette before think_of her handbag , and find a crumpled stray cigarette at its bottom , which taste peculiarly of face_powder . 
he leave a note prop on the desk ask her to call him sometime today , and drive home . 
after he 'd get_out fresh liver for bast , he pause to look at her crouch daintily over her dish . 
surely she be just a_trifle fat around the middle ? 
he seem to remember read somewhere that person have large litter , and suffer a dismaying vision of the apartment overrun with a dozen kitten . 
`` y_que_sigue_despues ? 
- what then '' ? he ask her severely . 
`` a lot of people be so peculiar that they do n't like cat , it 's not the easy thing in the world to find good home for kitten - and , damn_it , you know very_well if i have them around long , impossible to give_away them away ! 
and i suppose now that you 've finally grow_up , if a_little late , you 'd go_on produce kitten every six month or_so . 
yes , well , it be a pity to spoil your girlish figure - which all those kitten would do anyway - but i think when you 've raise these we 'll just have the vet fix it so there won n't be any more . 
i wonder if the person would take one . 
and it be no good look at me like that '' , as she wind affectionately around his ankle . 
person 's long nose unexpectedly wrinkle up . 
`` happen to be in the hall ! 
happen to hear you quarrel about her ! 
oh , well , you can n't really blame person . 
she lose her beau to you '' . 
but she was talk of person when she see the black line of the open door ; person remember it clearly . 
person go_on . 
`` i 've got to get busy . 
person 's take to her bed , with the door locked . 
she open it an inch and poke out the key for me to give you . 
here '' - she thrust a bundle of key strung on a thick red cord into person 's hand . 
`` not that there be much use in lock_up the smokehouse and the storehouse now . 
drink your coffee '' - 
coffee . 
`` it be - cold '' . 
person suddenly look quite capable of pour it down her throat . 
`` i do n't want it '' , person say , firmly . 
`` oh . 
well - i 'll take it down with me as i go '' . 
person swoop_up the cup and hike_up her top hoop as if about to take_off with a racing start . 
at the door she turn back , her roman_nose look very long now and satiric . 
`` i forget . 
person and person have go_after them . 
it be just like that book your northern friend write - except there be n't any ice_floe to cross and no bloodhound '' . 
`` i do n't know person . 
what can they do if they find them '' ? 
`` they can n't do anything . 
it be silly , childish , run after them like that . 
i tell person so . 
but of_course the patroller won n't be of any help , not with everything so upset and that yankee cavalry outfit they say is run around , god_knows_where '' . 
she had swish away , she had be gone for a long_time probably when person suddenly realize that she ought_to stop her , pour_out the coffee , so no_one would drink it . 
but_then the so-called coffee be bad enough at_best , cold it be all_but undrinkable - especially that cup ! 
she be deeply , horribly sure that person had fill it with opium . 
she had quarrel with person , she had resist his demand for money - and if she die , by the provision of her marriage_contract , person would inherit legally not_only the immediate sum of gold under the floorboard in the office , but later , when the war be over , her father 's entire estate . 
she feel cold and hot , sticky and chilly at_the_same_time . 
now wait a minute , she tell herself , think_about it ; person be not the only person in this house who could have put opium in that coffee . 
she had lose a bottle of opium - but that be on the trip from new_orleans . 
or someone had take it during her first day at location . 
yes , she had miss it after her talk with person , after dinner , just before person was shoot . 
person or person had enter her room while she sleep , bring back her washed clothes . 
so somebody else could have come_in , too - then or later while she be out of the room . 
it would have be easy to identify as opium by its odor . 
it be not very reasonable to believe that person had procure unprocurable opium and come_back to location with a formed plan to murder her . 
he did n't even know that she be there . 
and he certainly could n't have guess that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she be not the yielding - yes , and credible fool he have every right to expect . 
no , he had been surprise , unpleasantly surprise , but surprise . 
then somebody else ? 
do n't question , person had say , do n't invite danger . 
her skin crawl : person had tell person that she be in the hall and the door be open . 
person had begin to tell person of person , she had begin to question and a little draft had creep across the room from the bedroom door , open barely enough to show a rim of blackness in the hall . 
so person - or anybody - could have listen , and that somebody could have already be supplied_with the missing bottle of opium . 
that be not reasonable either . 
the opium had disappear before person 's death and whoever shoot him could not by any stretch of the imagination have foresee person 's own doubt and suspicion - and question . 
she begin to doubt whether there had be in_fact a lethal_dose of opium in the cup . 
so suppose somebody only wish to frighten her , so she would leave location ! 
that make a certain amount of logic . 
added to the argument be the fact that while she might have taste the coffee if it had be still hot , she might even have drink some of it , she would n't have take enough to kill her , for she would have been warn by its taste . 
no . 
it be merely an attempt to frighten her . 
she would n't go_back to new_york as person suggest ; she would n't run like a scared cat . 
but - well , she 'd be very careful . 
she dress and the accustomed routine restore to her a sense of normal everyday life . 
but before she leave her room she dig_into her big moire bag , take_out the envelope hold her marriage_contract and the wax seal had been break . 
so somebody else know what would happen to her father 's money if she die . 
person had know all_along . 
person did n't need to break the wax seal , read the contract and find_out . 
he could conceivably have wish to make sure ; person love location , it be like a part of his breath and body ; person had stress the need for money . 
person would never have try to give her poison ! 
she thrust the envelope back in the bag ; there be no point in lock_up it up in the armoire now , it be like lock the barn after the horse was steal . 
and in_all_likelihood , by now , there be more than one person in the house who know the term of her marriage_contract . 
there be no point either in tell herself again what a fool she 'd be . 
she go downstairs and receive another curious shock , for when person flap into the dining_room in her homemade moccasins , person ask her when she had bring coffee to her room and person say she had n't . 
`` too much work this morning , person - everybody gone like that '' - 
person swallow past another kind of constriction in her throat . 
`` well , then who bring it '' ? 
`` miss person . 
she come to the kitchen and say she take it up to you '' . 
person put_down a dish of lukewarm rice . 
`` not much breakfast this morning . 
i do n't know what we 're going_to do , person '' . 
`` we 've got to eat '' , person say , curtly , because a chill crawl over her again . 
person ? 
person flap away . 
the rice be n't dosed with opium , indeed it have no taste at_all , not a grain of salt . 
she eat what she could and go_out along the covered passageway , with the rain drip from the vine . 
in the kitchen person was despairingly pick chicken . 
`` get a basket '' , person tell her . 
`` we 'll go_to the storehouse '' . 
person drop a chicken and a flurry of feather , and go with her through the drizzle , to the storehouse . 
person find the right key and unlock the door . 
it be a long , low room , like a root_cellar , for it be bank up with soil , and vine had run rampant over that , too . 
it be dark but dry and cool . 
she doled_out what person vaguely guess be the right amount of dried pea , egg , cornmeal , a little salt . 
the shelf look empty than when person had show her the storeroom , and since the man from the commissary had call ; there be certainly now fewer mouth to feed but there be less to feed them with . 
she take person to the smokehouse , unlock it and see with satisfaction there be still a quantity of ham and side of bacon , hang from the smoke stained rafter . 
they would n't go hungry , not_yet . 
and the field be green and growing . 
`` ca n't you possibly imagine what life is going to be like , here '' ? 
person had say . 
person . 
she send person back to the house , her basket and her apron laden . 
she stand for a moment , rain drip from the tree over her head , think_of person . 
person have the opportunity to take the bottle of opium from person 's room . 
person have the cool ruthlessness to do whatever she make_up_one's_mind up her mind to do . 
she could n't see how her death could affect person . 
she could n't see any reason why person would attempt to frighten her . 
besides , there be something hysterical and silly , something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her . 
person be neither hysterical nor silly and person rather doubt if she had ever be childish . 
yet person had suggest that person return to new_york . 
person could have shoot person - if she 'd have a reason to kill him . 
there be no use in stand there in the drizzle , try to find a link between person 's murder and opium in a cup of coffee . 
she start back for the house , see a light in the office , open the door and surprise a domestic little scene which be far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder . 
person , person and person were mend shoe . 
a lighted lamp stand on the table that dusky , drizzling day . 
they were all three bend over a shabby riding_boot ; person have a tack_hammer . 
person hold a patch of leather , person steady something , a tiny brad , waiting for person 's poised hammer . 
person say , `` first thing i do when i get to location again , be get me a yankee '' - 
`` with boot on '' , person laugh_softly . 
person look up and see her . 
person look up and stiffen . 
person did n't look up at_all . 
there be no way to know , no way to guess whether any one of them be surprised at person 's appearance , believe her to be drugged and senseless - and just possibly dead . 
person say , `` come in , person . 
reckon you know the news '' . 
and what news , person think as satirically as person might have say it . 
person 's face be suddenly a_little fixed and questioning . 
he turn_to person and person . 
`` take your cobbler 's shop somewhere else . 
i want to talk to person '' . 
everything in the office , the spreading circle of lamplight , the patch of leather in person 's hand . 
person poised with the tack_hammer , the homely , everyday atmosphere , all deny an attempt at murder . 
a rush of panic catch person . 
`` no . 
not now . 
i mean i 've got_to - to see to the kitchen . 
person '' - 
her words jumble together and she all_but run from the office and from the question in person 's face . 
now why did i do that ? 
she think as warm , drizzling rain touch her face . 
she be no schoolgirl , refuse to bear tale . 
as she reach the kitchen door the answer present itself ; if she tell anyone of the opium it must be person , her husband . 
it might be , indeed it had already prove to be a marriage without love , but it be marriage . 
so she could n't choose person as a confidant ; it must be person . 
always provided_that person himself had not dose her coffee with opium , she think , as coldly and sharply , again , as person might have say it . 
she pause at the kitchen door , catch_one's_breath her breath , tell herself firmly that the opium be only an attempt to frighten her and go_into the kitchen , where person was eye the chicken dismally and person was clean lamp_chimney . 
person give a gulp . 
`` person , i can n't cut_up no chicken . 
person say she will n't '' . 
again the homely , everyday detail of daily living refute a vicious attempt to frighten her - or to murder her . 
the homely everyday detail of living and domestic requirement also press upon her with their immediate urgency . 
no_matter what had happen or had n't happen , somebody had_to see about dinner . 
she eye the chicken with , if she had know it , something of person 's dismal look and think with a certain fury of the time she had spend on latin verb . 
`` not since last night . 
i did n't think there was any reason to '' . 
`` maybe there is n't . 
speak to him again anyway . 
try talk to some of the fellow he work with , friend , anyone . 
try to find_out how happy he be with his wife , whether he play_around with woman . 
you might try look_into his wife too . 
she might have been talk to some of her friend about her husband if they 've been have any trouble '' . 
`` you think person 's the one we 're look_for '' ? 
`` yeah . 
i think he might be '' , person say grimly . 
`` then_again he might not '' . 
`` what a stinking world '' , person say . 
`` person be person 's best_friend '' . 
`` i know '' . 
`` will you be come_back soon '' ? 
`` i think so . 
i be on_the_way to see the person woman '' . 
`` person 's secretary ? 
what for ? 
you do n't think person be the - '' ? 
`` i do n't think anything . 
i just do n't want to go_off_half_cocked before pick_up person , that be all '' . 
person interrupt . 
`` person say he be in his office all day with her yesterday . 
i 'd like to make sure . 
also , it be just possible she might know something about person '' . 
`` right . 
i 'll see you later '' . 
`` are n't you ever going_to go_home '' ? 
`` it sure_as_hell does n't look like it , does_it ? 
i 'm tell you , if these corpse ever know the trouble they put us to , they 'd think_twice before let themselves get knock_off '' . 
`` remember to tell that to the next corpse you meet '' . 
person hang_up and sit on the small telephone_booth bench , massage his right leg . 
he look at his watch . 
it was ten minute before eleven . 
he wonder how long it would be before they have a signed confession from person . 
thirty year ' experience let him know , even at this early stage , that person be his man . 
but he still want to know why . 
it was a cold , windy day , the day after person 's death , but person pay no attention to the blustery october wind . 
after leave person , person have no destination . 
he simply walk , not notice where he be , not care . 
he stop automatically at the street_corner , wait for the traffic_light to change , unheeding of other people , his coat open and flap . 
as he walk , he try to think . 
of person . 
of himself . 
mainly of what person had try to make him believe . 
there was nothing coherent about his thinking . 
it be a succession of picture image pass through his mind : the same ones , different ones , in no apparent sequence , in no logical succession . 
the enormity of what person had tell him make it impossible for person to accept , with any degree of realism , the actuality of it . 
person 's words have intellectual meaning for him only . 
emotionally , they penetrate him not at_all . 
whoever_he_was and your wife be_intimate . 
person remember person 's exact word . 
they make_sense and yet they did n't . 
he know person had tell him the truth . 
it be so . 
yet it be n't so . 
it be n't so because it could n't be so . 
when person be alive - and he remember the pressure of her hand rest_on lightly on his arm - she had be the center of his life . 
she be the sun , he the closest planet orbiting around her , the rest of the world existing and visible yet removed . 
for fifty-five year he had live , progress towards a no-goal , eat , work , breathe without plan , without reason . 
person had come_along to justify everything . 
she be his goal , she be his reason . 
he had live all his life wait for her . 
not once , in the time that he had know her , had he ever consider the possibility , not once , not for one one-thousandth of a second , of her infidelity . 
he could not consider it now . 
not really . 
and so he walk , aimless again . 
the walk end , inevitably , right in front of his hotel building . 
the doorman begin to nod his head automatically , then remember who person be , what had happen to him the night before . 
he look at person with undisguised curiosity . 
person pass by him without see him . 
he cross the lobby and ride up in the elevator lost in his own thought . 
in the apartment itself , all be still . 
the police be no_longer there . 
there was no evidence that anything be different than it had be . 
except that person be n't there . 
without take_off his coat , he sit in the blue chair which still face the closed bedroom door . 
at_last , sit there , in the familiar surroundings , the truth begin to sink_in . 
who ? 
he feel no anger towards person , no sense that she had betray him . 
who ? 
she be all he have , everything he have , everything he want . 
someone had take_away her away from him . 
who ? 
where there is a left-hand entry in the ledger , there is a right-hand one , he remember from his schooldays . 
where there is a victim , there is a killer . 
who ? 
whoever_he_was and your wife be_intimate . 
he rise from the chair , take_off his coat . 
quickly , he go_into the bedroom . 
the bed still show sign of where person had lie . 
person stand there for a long_time . 
he look at the bed unblinkingly . 
the bed be empty now . 
person would lie in it no_more . 
he would lie in it no_more . 
person wonder whether person had lie in that same bed with & & & who ? 
for thirty minute , person stand there . 
at the end of the half-hour , rack his brain , think_of over_and_over_again of person , her friend , her past , he leave the bedroom . 
who ? 
he could think_of no answer . 
person put_on his coat again . 
before leave , he take_a_look one last , lingering look at the apartment . 
he know he would never see it again . 
in the street , walk as quickly as he could , person be a lone figure . 
on person , person 's death had a quite different effect . 
for person , person 's death be a source of guilty , but nonetheless soaring , happy hope . 
in person 's defense , it must be say she be unaware of the newborn hope . 
if anyone had ask her , she would have describe herself only as nervous and worried . 
the figure on the worksheet paper in_front_of her were jump and wave around so badly it was_all_she_could_do to make_out them out clearly enough to copy them with the typewriter . 
she wonder whether person would call . 
she want to be with him , to give him the comfort and companionship she know he need . 
she had skip her lunch hour in the fear that he might call while she be out . 
he had n't . 
and now she was feel sick , both from concern about person and hunger . 
why had n't he call ? 
man , she reflect , even man like person , be unpredictable . 
she try to think_of his unpredictable action in the eleven year she had know him and discover they be n't so many after_all . 
person really be quite predictable . 
that be one of the thing she like about person . 
he be n't like so many other man . 
the dentist last night , for_instance . 
dinner and the movie had be fine . 
he had take her upstairs to say good_night . 
she had invite him in for coffee . 
it be in the kitchen , as she was watch the kettle , wait for the water to boil , that he had grab for her . 
without warning , without give her a chance to prepare_for it . 
from behind , he had put his arm on her shoulder , turn her around , and press her to him , so close she could n't breathe . 
later , she apologize for the long scratch across his face , try to explain she could n't help herself , that the panic arise in her unwanted . 
but he had n't understand . 
when he leave , she know she would never see him again . 
person be n't like that . 
she could always predict what person was going_to do , ever since she first meet him . 
except for that one morning . 
the morning he walk in to announce to her , blushing , that he be married . 
she think she was going_to die . 
she had assume before then that one day he would ask her to marry him . 
person could n't remember when she had first arrive at this conclusion . 
she think it was sometime during the second week she work for person . 
it was nothing that he say or do , but it seem so natural to her that she should be work for him , look_forward to his eventual proposal . 
she be thirty-one year old then . 
her mother be already considerably concerned over her daughter 's future . 
but person had been able to maintain a serene and assured composure in the face of her widowed mother 's continued carping , had be able to resist her urging to date anyone who offer the slightest possibility of matrimony . 
for person , it was only a matter of time before person would propose . 
it was to_be_expected that person would be shy , slow in take such a momentous step . 
person go_along in life , she know , convinced that he deserve the love and faith of no woman . 
as_a_result , he never look_for it . 
but one day , she expect , he would somehow discover , without her having_to tell him , that there was such a woman in the world ; a woman who be willing to give him love , faith , and anything else a woman could give a husband . 
indeed , there was a woman who , unasked , had already give him love . 
unquestionably , person love person . 
and_then , unexpectedly , person made his announcement . 
on that first day , person literally think she was going_to die , or , at_the_least the very least , go out of her mind . 
it might have be easy for her if person had n't be everything that person be not . 
person be thirty year young than person , tall than person , pretty than person have any right to hope for , much_less expect . 
person could have marry a score of man . 
there was no reason for her to marry someone like person , there was no need for her to marry person . 
person had come into the office , on somebody 's recommendation , because she need help in prepare her income_tax_return . 
person had fill_out the return and because , when he be finished , it was close to the lunch hour , he had politely ask person to join him , never expect her to accept . 
person know all this because the door to person 's office be open and , without strain too hard , she could hear everything that was say . 
person had go_out , say he would be back in an hour . 
he had n't come_back for over two . 
after that day , person still did n't know exactly what had happen . 
there were morning when person come_in late , afternoon when he leave early , day when he did n't come_in at_all . 
person know something must be cause person 's new , strange behavior but she never once connect it with person . 
it be too unprecedented . 
then , six week after the day person first come into the office , person announce he and person be married . 
somehow , person manage to cover the stunned surprise and offer her congratulation . 
that night the two of them leave for a week 's honeymoon in acapulco . 
while they be away person come into the office every morning , run thing as she had always run them for person , go_through the week in a dazed stupor , get thing done automatically , out of habit . 
for exactly one week , she be able to continue in this manner . 
on the morning of person 's return , however , her strength leave her . 
two hour of watch his serenely happy face , listen to his soft humming as he bend over his penciled figure , and person had_to leave . 
she stay away for ten day . 
those ten day be like no others that person had know . 
mostly , she stay in bed . 
she did n't tell anyone , even her mother , what be wrong . 
she refuse to have a doctor , insist there was nothing a doctor could do for her . 
his son watch until he get as far as the hall , almost out_of_sight , then hurry after . 
`` dad . 
dad , wait '' . 
he catch_up_with the old_man in the living_room . 
person had put_down the suitcase to open the front_door . 
`` just this one favor , dad . 
just do n't tell person that crazy opinion of yours '' . 
`` why not '' ? 
the old_man give the room a stare in leave ; under the scraggly brow the pale old eye burn with a bitter memory . 
`` it be the truth '' . 
`` the person girl was kill by person 's son . 
person and person have be across the street , talk to the kid . 
they 've find some sort of new evidence , a bundle of clothes or something , and it must link the kid even strongly to the crime . 
why won n't you accept fact ? 
the two kid be together a_lot , they were have some kind of teenage affair - god_knows how far that had go - and the kid 's crippled . 
he limp , and the man who hit you and take the cane , he limp . 
my_god , how much more do you want '' ? 
his father look him over closely . 
`` you sound like an old_woman . 
you should have go_to work today , ' stead of sneak around spy on the person house '' . 
`` now , see_here '' - 
`` the trouble with you '' , person begin , and then check himself . 
person had open the oven and there was a drifting odor of hot biscuit . 
the old_man open the door and step out into the sunlight . 
`` is n't enough time to go into it '' , he finish , and slam the door in his son 's face . 
person turn from the window drapery . 
`` they find something else up there '' , she say half aloud to the empty room . 
`` they take_away it away , overall or something '' . 
she walk restlessly across the room , then back to the window . 
`` now they 've go , they did n't come_back , and they did n't arrest that person boy '' . 
she stand frown and chew her lip . 
she was wear a brown cotton dress , cut across the hip in a way that be supposed to make her look slim , a yoke set into the skirt and flaring pleat below . 
she smooth the skirt , sit_down , then stand_up and go_back to the window . 
`` why on_earth did i send him off to work ? 
there was excuse enough to keep him home , that young person 's still over there '' . 
with sudden energy , she go to the phone and ring person 's office and ask for him . 
`` i think you had_better come home '' . 
`` person , we be so busy . 
person 's been_on_everybody 's_neck , an order he expect did n't come_through and he 's '' - 
`` i do n't care . 
i want you here . 
i be all alone and certain thing are go_on that look very ominous . 
i need someone to go_out and find_out what 's happen '' . 
`` but i could n't do that , even if i be home '' ! 
his voice grow high and trembling . 
`` i can n't be underfoot every time those cop turn_around ! 
they 'll think i do something '' . 
he could n't see the grin that split her mouth ; the tooth that shine into the phone be like a shark 's . 
`` you 'll just have to risk it . 
you can n't wander along in the dark , can you ? 
i 'd think that you , even more_than i , would be wonder what they be up_to . 
they find some clothes '' , she . 
`` what '' ? 
deliberately , she ignore the yelp . 
`` also , that person be here . 
i guess he want to ask you some question . 
i stall him off . 
he does n't expect you until five '' . 
`` then i 'd better wait until five '' . 
`` no . 
come home right_away '' . 
she slap the receiver into its holder and step away . 
her eye be bright with anticipation . 
in his office , person replace the phone slowly . 
he rise from his chair . 
he have to cough then ; he go to the window and choke there with the fresh breeze on his face . 
he get his hat out of the closet . 
for a moment he think_of go_into person 's office to explain that he have to leave , but there was now such a pain in his chest , such a pounding in his head , that he decide to let_go it go . 
he pass the receptionist in the outer office , mutter , `` i 've got to go_out for a little while '' . 
let her call person if she want to , let person raise_the_roof or even can him , he did n't care . 
he get_into the car . 
put the key into the switch , press the accelerator with his foot , put the car into reverse , seem vast endeavor almost beyond the ability of his shaking body . 
once out in the street , the traffic be a gadfly maze in which he wander stricken . 
when he turn into the highway that lead to the outskirts of the city and then rise toward home , he have to pull over to the curb and wait for a_few minute , suck_in air and squint and blink his eye to clear them of tear . 
what on_earth be in person 's mind , that she want him up there spy on what the cop were do ? 
what did she think he could do ? 
he try to ignore what his own common_sense tell him , but it be n't possible ; her motive be too blatant . 
she want him to get_into trouble . 
she want the police to notice him , suspect him . 
she was going to keep_on scheme , poke , prod , suggest , and dictate until the cop get_up enough interest in him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask question . 
and he know in that moment , with a cold sinking of despair , a dying of old hope , that person had spread some kind of word there among the neighbor . 
nothing bald , open ; but enough . 
they 'd have some suspicion to repeat to the police . 
though his inner thought cringe at it , he force himself to think_back , recreate the scene in which person claim to have catch him molest the child . 
it had n't amount to anything . 
there had been nothing evil or dirty in his intention . 
a second scene flash before his mind , the interior of the garage at the new house and the young person girl turn startled to meet him , the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then the brightness as person had click on the light . 
suppose the cop somehow get hold of that ? 
well , it had n't be what it seem , he 'd have no idea the girl be in there . 
he had n't touch her . 
and when he come to examine the scene , there was a certain staginess to it , it have the smell of planning , and a swift suspicion dart into his mind . 
too monstrous , of_course . 
person would n't have plot a thing like that . 
it was just that little accident played_into_her_hands . 
like this murder . 
he lean_on the wheel , clutch it , stare into the sunlight , and try to bring order into his thought . 
he feel light-headed and sick . 
there was no use wander off into a territory of utter nightmare . 
person be his wife . 
she be married to him for better or for worse . 
she would n't be wilfully plan his destruction . 
but she was . 
she was . 
even as the conviction of truth roar through him , shatter his last hope of safety , he was reach to release the hand_brake , to head up the road for home , do her bidding . 
he drive , and the road wobble , familiar scene creep past on either side . 
he come to a stretch of old orange grove , the tree dead , some of them uproot , and then there was an outlying shopping area , and tract house . 
he have the feeling that he should abandon the car and run_off somewhere to hide . 
but he could n't imagine where . 
there was really no place to go , finally , except home to person . 
at the gate he slow , look_around . 
person be beside his car , on the curb at the right , just stand there morosely ; he did n't even look up . 
behind him on the steps of the little office sit person ; he be straight , something angry in his attitude , as if he might be wait to report something . 
person step_on the gas . 
a new idea drift in from_nowhere . 
he could go_to the police . 
he could tell them his fear of be involved , he could explain what had happen in the old neighborhood and how person had misunderstand and how she had hold_over it over him - the scene be complete in his mind at the moment , even to his own jerking and sniveling , and person 's silent patience . 
he could throw himself on the mercy of the police_department . 
it be n't what person would want him to do , though . 
he be sure of this . 
once he had abandon himself to the very worst , once he had quiet all the dragon of worry and suspense , there would n't be very much for person to do . 
at that moment , person almost slam on the brakes to go_back to person and ask if person be about . 
it would be such a relief . 
what be that old sign , supposed to be painted over a door somewhere , abandon hope , all ye who enter here ? 
why , person say to himself , surprised at his own sudden insight , i 'll bet some of those people who enter be just as happy as can be . 
they 've worry , they 've lie_awake night , they 've shake at the slightest footstep , they 've picture their own destruction , and now it be all over and they can give_up . 
sure , they 're give_up hope . 
hand_in_hand with hope go_with thing like terror and apprehension . 
good-bye . 
person wave a hand at the empty street . 
glad to see you go . 
he drive into the paved space before the garage and get_out , slam the car_door . 
he look up and down the street . 
if person 's car had be in_sight , person would have walk directly to it . 
he go to the front_door and open it and look in . 
person enter the room from the hallway to the kitchen . 
she have a cup of something steam , coffee perhaps , in one hand , a fresh piece of toast in the other . 
she stand there , watch person come_in , and she put the piece of toast in her mouth and bite_off one corner with a huge chomp of her white tooth . 
`` person '' - 
`` i 've been think '' , she say , swallow the toast . 
`` did n't you have an old pair of painting overall in the garage ? 
you use them that time you paint the porch at our other house . 
and then you wipe_up some grease '' . 
she had catch him off_guard , no preparation , nothing certain but that ahead lie some kind of disaster . 
`` no . 
wait a minute . 
what do you '' - 
`` i 've been look_for them , and they be gone . 
i be sure they be in the garage up until a_couple_of day ago . 
or even yesterday . 
you used to paint in them , and then you just take them for rag . 
the police have them now '' . 
`` i do n't remember any overall at_all '' . 
`` they be all faded . 
worn through at the knee '' . 
she stand sip and chew and watch . 
`` green paint , be n't it ? 
well , i be not sure of the color . 
but you have them '' . 
`` person , sit_down . 
put_down the cup of coffee . 
tell me what this be all about '' . 
she shake her head . 
she took another bite of toast . 
person notice almost absently how she chew , how the whole side of her cheek move , a slab of fat that extend down into her neck . 
`` my_goodness , you ought to remember if i do . 
you 're going_to have to go to the police and explain what happen . 
tell them the truth , or something , before they come here '' . 
a seeping coldness enter person 's being ; his nerve seem frostbitten down to the tip of his tingling finger and his spine feel stiff and glass like , liable to break like an icicle at any moment . 
`` i 've never own any painting overall . 
a man with a sketch_pad in hand sit with a large pink woman in a small office at the end of a long , dim corridor and make pencil line on_paper and say , `` is this more like it , person ? 
or are the eyebrow more like this '' ? 
when he had finish with that , he would go_to another part of the hotel and say much the same thing to someone else , most probably a busboy . 
`` begin to look_like him now , would you say ? 
different about the mouth , huh ? 
more like this , maybe '' ? 
man blow dust on object in a room on the seventeenth floor of the location and blow it off again , and do the same in a tiny , almost airless room in a tenement in the location . 
and man also use vacuum_cleaner in both room , suck dust up once_more . 
man from the third_detective_district , location , have the long , the most tedious , job . 
at the location there had , at the time at_issue , been twenty-three overnighter , count couple as singular . 
these include , as one , person and person , who had check_in a little after noon the day before , and had not check_out together . 
but person was not include ; he had be at the location for almost a week . 
there be , of_course , no special reason to believe that the man or woman they seek had stay only overnight at the hotel . 
the twenty-three ( or twenty-two with the person themselves omit ) provide merely a place to start , and their identification be the bare of start . 
with name and address listed , verification come next . 
it would take time ; it would , almost inevitably , trouble_some_water . 
( `` i certainly be not at the location last night and my husband could n't have be . 
he be in boston . 
of_course he be in '' - ) 
the location across the street provide almost twice as_many problem . 
the location offer respectable and convenient lodgings to people from the suburb who want to see a show and did n't want - heaven_knew did n't want ! 
- to lunge anxiously through crowded street to railroad_station and , at odd hours of night , drive from smaller railroad_station to distant home , probably through rain or , in november , something worse . 
the location be less expensive than the location . 
the location have fifty-four overnighter , again count room rather than people . 
check_out the overnighter out . 
fail to find what was want , as be most likely , check_out other guest , with special - but not exclusive - attention to those with room on the street . 
( anyone active enough can reach a roof , wherever his room may be . ) 
and know , while all this go_on , that there be no real reason to suppose that the murderer had be a guest in either hotel . 
it be not even certain the shot had been fire from either hotel . 
there be other roof , less convenient but not impossible . 
it be dull business , detecting , and hard on foot . 
there was also the one salient question to ask , and ask widely : did you notice anything out-of-the-way ? 
like , for_example , a man carry a twenty-two_rifle , probably with a telescopic_sight attached ? 
there was , of_course , no hope it really would be that simple . 
the sniper , whether psychopathic marksman or murderer by intent , would hardly have walk to his vantage_point with rifle over shoulder , whistle a marching tune . 
anybody carry anything that might hide a rifle ? 
long thin suitcase ? 
or long fat suitcase , for_that_matter ? 
shrug meet that , from room_clerk , from bellhop . 
who measure ? 
but nothing , it appear , long enough to attract attention . 
case , say , for musical_instrument ? 
none note at the location . 
several at the location . 
a combo was stay there . 
and had been for a week . 
anything else ? 
anything at all ? 
shrug meet that . 
( person , location , think for a time he might be_on_to_something . 
a refuse bin at the location turn_up a florist 's box - a very long box for very long stemmed flower . 
trace of oil on green tissue ? 
the lab to check . 
the lab : sorry . 
no oil . ) 
anything at all strange ? 
well , a man had try , at the location , to register with an ocelot . 
at the location , a guest had come in a collapsible wheelchair . 
at the location one guest had have his head heavily bandaged , and another have a bandaged foot and had walk with crutch . 
there had also been a man who must have have st._vitus or something , because he keep jerk his head . 
as report dribble in , person toss them into the centrifuge which had become his head . 
person come_in . 
there was no sign of person at her house on location , location , connecticut . 
the house be modern , large , on five acre . 
must have cost plenty . 
the state cop would check from_time_to_time ; pass word when there was word to pass . 
person toss this news into the centrifuge . 
sort_out thing out , damn_it . 
sort_out the next move . 
try to forget motive for_the_moment . 
consider opportunity . 
only those actually with person when he was shoot , or who had leave the party within not more_than five minute ( make five arbitrary ) positively have none . 
the person ; person , person 's publicity director ; person , producer of uprising . 
they had be with person when he was shoot , could not therefore have shoot him from above . 
take person . 
he had leave after the scuffle ; had been see to leave . 
he would have have ample time to go_into a blind somewhere and wait his prey . 
consider him seriously , therefore ? 
intangible enter , then - hunch which feel like fact . 
person would ambush , certainly ; person undoubtedly had . 
person be , presumably , a better than average shot . 
but - hunch , now - person would not ambush anything which go on two leg instead of four . 
because , if for no other reason , person would never for a moment suppose he be not bigger , tough , than anything else that go on two leg . 
ambush are lay by those who doubt themselves , as any man may against a tiger . 
person had had to `` go_on '' from the party and had , presumably , gone_on . 
to be check_out further . 
forget motive ? 
no , motive be a part of fact . 
nobody in_his_right_mind punish a quarter-century old dereliction . 
grudge simply do not keep that well in a sane mind . 
person had accomplish much in a quarter-century of a century . 
jeopardize it now to correct so old a wrong ? 
person shake his head . 
also , he think , i doubt if she could hit the side of a barn with a shotgun . 
person herself ? 
she had leave the party early , plead a headache . 
no lack of opportunity , presume she have a gun . 
she might , conceivably , have bring one in in a large enough suitcase . 
( check on the person luggage . ) 
she might now have take_away it away again . 
motive - her husband wander ? 
bitter , unreasoning jealousy ? 
heaven know it happen and hell know it too . 
but - it happen , almost always , among the primitive and , usually , among the very young . 
( call it mentally young ; call it retarded . ) 
there was nothing to indicate that person be primitive . 
she did not move in primitive circle . 
she be young , but not that young . 
it occur to person that he was , on a hunch basis , eliminate a good many . 
he remind himself that all elimination be tentative . 
he also remind himself that he have an unusual number of possibility . 
the person , mother or son , or mother and son ? 
opportunity be obvious . 
motive . 
here , too , the cause to hate lie well back in the year . 
but bitterness have more cause to remain , even increasingly to corrode . 
with the boy , particularly . 
the boy had , apparently - if person be right in what she had tell person - only in recent month been force to give_up college , to work as a busboy . 
see the man he blame for this made_much_of - youth and bitterness and - 
person pick_up the telephone ; get person . 
`` send_out a pickup on person and the boy when you 've get enough to go_on '' , person say . 
`` right '' ? 
person would do . 
a man named person , playwright director , had express a wish that person drop_dead . 
he would say , of_course , that he had not really have any such wish ; that what he had say be no more than one of those thing one does say , lightly , mean nothing . 
which probably would turn_out to be true ; which he obviously had to be give the opportunity to say . 
a man named person , with `` y '' and `` e '' but pronounce without them , had been fire at person 's insistence . 
he be also , if person be right , a close acquaintance of person 's than she , now , was incline to admit . 
he might deny the latter ; would certainly deny any connection between the two thing , or any connection of either with murder . 
he would have to be give the opportunity . 
person ? 
it be evident that person be the man to go . 
it be evident that a captain should remain at his desk , direct with a firm hand and keep a firm seat . 
person be good_and_tired of the wall opposite , and the crack in the plaster . 
let person keep the firm seat ; let person . 
when siamese_cat be intertwine it is difficult to tell where one leave_off and another begin . 
stilts and shadow , on person 's bed , appear to be one cat - rather large , as siamese_cat go , and , to_be_sure , have two head and two tail . 
on_the_other_hand , they , or it , seem to have no leg whatever . 
person say , `` hi '' , to her cat , and add that proper cat meet their human at the door . 
of four dark brown ear , one twitch slightly at this . 
`` all_right '' , person say . 
`` i know it is n't dinnertime '' . 
but at this the one too_large cat suddenly become two cat , stretch . 
shadow , the more talkative , begin at_once to talk , her voice piteous . 
stilts , a more direct cat , leap from the bed and trot briskly toward the kitchen . 
shadow look surprised , wail , and trot after her . 
the hell it is n't dinnertime , two waving tail tell person . 
it was not , whatever tale was tell by tail . 
person presumably would cope . 
she might be firm . 
it was most unlikely that she would be firm . 
they want to be fat cat , person think , and light a cigarette and lean_back on a chaise and consider pull_together her thought together . 
after a time , it occur to her that her thought be not worth the trouble . 
a vague feeling that person had had_it_coming be hardly a thought and be , in_any_event , reprehensible . 
had person 's explanation of her confidence , so uninvited , be a_little thin ? 
that be more like a thought , but not a great_deal more . 
had that tall dark boy , carry tray too heavy for him , find what he might have consider adulation of a man he probably hate more_than he could bear ? 
and possess himself - how ? 
- of a rifle and kill ? 
person find she have no answer ; have only a hope . 
the poor kid - the poor , frail kid . 
some people have luck and some have no luck and that , whatever people who prefer order say , be the size_of_it . 
the poor , unlucky - 
the telephone ring . 
person realize , to her surprise , that she had been almost doze . 
at four o'clock in the afternoon . 
two martini for lunch - that be the trouble . 
i ought to remember . 
do n't pretend . 
you do remember . 
you just - `` hello ? 
yes , this be she ? 
what '' ? 
the voice have music in it . 
even with word come too fast , they come on the music of the voice . 
`` i say i would '' , person say . 
`` they won n't talk_about who give the information . 
not unless they have to . 
they do n't , person . 
not unless they have '' - 
she was interrupt . 
`` call this a cry for help '' , person say . 
`` through a door conveniently unlocked '' , person supplement . 
`` that damn door '' , say the police_chief . 
`` a gift_horse to be view with suspicion '' . 
person 's dark face wear a meditative look . 
`` if there be collusion between an outside murderer and a member of the household it would be an elementary precaution to check on the door later . 
and it make a very poor red_herring for an inside_job . 
much better to break a cellar window '' . 
`` do n't forget , there be the hope it would pass for a natural death '' , person remind him . 
`` well , with a house as big as that there must be at_least one cellar window that would n't be notice right_away unless there was a police_investigation '' . 
`` yeah . 
and a pane_of_glass be n't hard to '' - 
the telephone interrupt him . 
he scoop_up the receiver and say , `` police_chief '' , into the mouthpiece , and then , `` oh yes , person . 
i was hope i 'd hear from you today '' . 
with his free hand he pull a pad and pencil toward him and begin to make note as he listen , say , `` uh-huh '' and `` i see '' at interval . 
at_last he say , `` well , thank_you for call , person . 
although there be no doubt in my mind and we 've been handle it as one i be glad to have it make official '' . 
he hang_up . 
`` coroner '' , he say to person . 
`` he 's just hear from the pathologist who say person apparently die from suffocation '' . 
person look at his note . 
`` many minute hemorrhage in the lung ; particle of lint and thread in the mouth and nostrils . 
scraping from the bed_linen identical with the lint and thread find in the nasal_cavity and oral_cavity . 
no other cause of death apparent . 
trachea clear of mucus and foreign object . 
brain examine for thrombosis , clot or hemorrhage . 
no sign of these , no gross hemorrhage of lung , heart , brain or stomach '' . 
he pause . 
`` that 's_about_it . 
oh , the time of death . 
the duration of the digestive process vary , the pathologist say , but the empty stomach and the finding in the upper gastrointestinal tract indicate that person die several hour after her seven o'clock dinner . 
probably around midnight , give_or_take an hour either way '' . 
person pause again . 
`` so there it be '' , he say . 
`` not your problem , of_course , unless person and the murderer be one_and_the_same '' . 
they discuss this possibility . 
however likely it be , person say , he could n't limit himself to it . 
he have to look_for other prospect , other motive until more conclusive evidence point to person come to light . 
person , with his investigation center_on the fraud , say that tomorrow he would go_to the_bronx bank through which person 's check to person had clear . 
person had to be locate , they agree . 
he might have be in collusion with person on the fraud ; he might be person 's murderer or have play some part in her death . 
this be person 's suggestion ; the police_chief shake his head over it . 
if person be involved in the fraud or the murder , then he too have another identity . 
no one the location police had question profess to know any more about him than about person . 
scholarship applicant ? 
person look doubtful . 
person explain that he was think_of an application send directly to person . 
then he ask to use the phone and call person , who say that he was just leave to keep a lunch date but would be home by two o ' o'clock . 
person say that he would see him at two and made another call , this one to person 's lawyer . 
person be out for the day , but person would be free at one-thirty . 
the secretary 's tone indicate that an appointment at such short notice be a concession for which person should be duly grateful . 
he infer that person and person be high-priced lawyer . 
he have lunch with person . 
promptly at one-thirty he enter person and person 's elegant suite of office in person 's new professional building . 
he dislike person on sight , conservative clothes and haircut , smile a shade too earnestly boyish for a man who must be well into his thirties , handclasp too consciously quick and firm . 
youngish man on_the_make , person label him , and be ready to guess that in a correct , not too pushing fashion , the junior partner of the firm have political ambition ; that person would be impeccably suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer ; that there be three child , two boy and a girl ; that she be active in the woman 's club and he in lions , rotary_club , and jaycee ; and finally , that neither of them had harbor an unorthodox opinion since their wedding_day . 
person know that he could be completely wrong about all this , but also know that he would go_on right on dislike person . 
person be prepared to be helpful in what he refer to with fastidious distaste as this unfortunate person affair , which would not , he say more than once , have ever come_about if person had only see fit to consult person or him about it . 
person regret not being able to find_fault_with so true a statement . 
he ask to see a copy of person 's will . 
person bring one out . 
the date , october 8 , 1957 , immediately catch the inspector 's eye . 
`` fairly recent '' , he remark . 
`` be she in the habit of make new will '' ? 
`` oh no . 
she have reason to change the one she make right after person 's death . 
her estate had grow considerably . 
she want to make a more equitable distribution of it among the group that would benefit the most ; particularly the scholarship fund . 
at the time the will was draw person mention to me how mentally alert she seem for her age , know just what change she want make and_so_forth '' . 
person hesitate . 
`` person and i have notice some lapse since , though . 
most_of them this past year , i 'd say . 
even two or three year ago i doubt that she 'd have become involved in this unfortunate person affair . 
she 'd have consult us , you see . 
she always did before , and show the utmost confidence in whatever we advise '' . 
the inspector nod , doubt this . 
person had n't strike him as ready to seek anyone 's advice , least_of_all person 's . 
with her sharp_tongue she 'd have cut_to_ribbons his pompousness to ribbons . 
it would have be person who handle her affairs . 
person settle back to read the will . 
he skim_over the millions that go to location , group , the civic_center , the group , the library , and_so_on , pause when he come to the scholarship fund . 
two millions were add to what had been set_aside for it in person 's lifetime , and the proviso make that as long as person continue to discharge his duty as administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the board_of_trustees ( hereinafter appoint by the bank administer the estate ) he was to be retain in his present capacity at a salary commensurate with the increased responsibility enlargement of the fund would entail . 
a splendid vote_of_confidence in person , person reflect . 
tenure , too . 
very nice for him . 
he go_on to personal bequest , a list of name largely unknown to him . 
twenty-five_thousand to each of the great-niece in oregon ( not much to blood_relative out of millions ) ten_thousand to this friend and that , five_thousand to another ; to person , the sum of ten_thousand dollar ; to the person , ten_thousand each ; to person the conditional bequest of ten_thousand to be pay to her in the event that she be still in person 's employ at the time of the latter 's death . 
( no additional five_thousand for each year after person 's twenty-first birthday ; person had n't get_around_to take_care of that . ) 
too_bad , person think . 
person had earn the larger bequest . 
person was leave twenty_thousand , person ten_thousand . 
there be no other name person recognize . 
person 's might well have been include , he feel . 
person had spend a small_fortune on a search for him but had make no provision for him in her will if he should be find after her death , and had never mention his name to her lawyer . 
person take_up this point with person , who shrug_off it off . 
`` old people have their idiosyncrasy '' . 
`` this one come a_bit high at thirty_thousand or more '' . 
`` well , she have a number of them where money was concern '' , person say . 
`` sometimes we 'd have trouble persuade her to make tax-exempt charitable contribution , and i 've know her to quarrel with a plumber over a bill for fix a faucet ; the next moment she 'd put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty_thousand into something as impractical as this unfortunate person affair . 
there was no tell how she 'd react to spend money '' . 
person inquire next about the audit of the scholarship fund . 
there was an annual audit , person inform him . 
no discrepancy or shortage had ever been find . 
person be a thoroughly honest and competent administrator . 
his salary had reach the ten_thousand mark . 
his expense run another four or five_thousand . 
the lawyer did n't know him very well although he see him occasionally at some dinner_party - person , like himself , person reflect , be the extra man so prize by hostess - and find him easy enough to talk to . 
but he did n't play golf , did n't seem to belong_to any local club - his work take him away a_lot , of_course - which probably account_for his tendency to keep_to_oneself . 
person 's glance begin to flicker to his watch . 
he say that he had already tell the police_chief that he did n't know what insurance man had recommend person to person . 
he would offer no theory to account_for her murder . 
the whole_thing , his manner convey , be so far outside the normal routine of person and person that it practically demand being sweep_under_the_rug . 
no_doubt person had snub him many_a time and he feel no grief over her passing . 
even_so , person 's dislike of the suave , correct lawyer deepen . 
it would be all_right with him , he decide , if his investigation of the fraud , with its probable by-product of murder , lead to person 's door . 
motive ? 
ten-thousand-dollar bequest . 
at_first_glance , not much of a motive for a man of his standing ; but for all his air of affluence , who could tell what his private financial picture be ? 
the inspector know as he leave that this be wishful_thinking . 
nevertheless , he make a mental note to look_into person 's financial background . 
person have a downtown address . 
he live in an apartment_house not over three or four year old , a reclaimed island of landscaped brick and glass on the fringe of the business_district . 
he occupy a two bedroom apartment on the fourth floor , use the second bedroom as his office . 
airy and bright , the apartment was furnish with good modern furniture , rug , and drapery . 
do by a professional decorator , person think , and somehow as impersonal , as unremarkable as its occupant . 
in location the rent would run close_to two_hundred a month ; in location , perhaps twenty-five less , not all_of it pay by person , who could charge off one room on his expense_account . 
he take person into the room he use as an office . 
it contain a desk , file , a typewriter on a stand , and two big leather armchair . 
a newspaper open at stock_market report lie on one of them . 
person fold_up it up and offer a drink . 
the inspector decline . 
to begin the interview , he ask if person , with more time to think_over it over , could add to what he had say the other day about person . 
person shake his head . 
`` it be all i think_about , too . 
that and her death . 
it be still unbelievable that it be murder . 
for all her domineering way , i can n't conceive_of her having have a deadly enemy '' . 
`` dammit , person , are you try to wreck my career ? 
because that be what you 're do - wreck it , wreck it , wreck it '' ! 
person had confront person on the building 's front steps - person had been permit no far - and back him against a wrought_iron railing . 
his rage had build_up as he make_one's_way his way here from the second floor , help by the quantity of champagne he had consume . 
person say , `` i did n't send_for you , person . 
i want the captain in_charge . 
where be he '' ? 
`` person , for god 's sake , go_away . 
the undersecretary 's in there . 
i tell you there be nothing between person and me , nothing . 
it be all in your mind '' . 
a_couple_of sob escape him , follow by a sentiment that reveal his emotional_state . 
`` why , i be not fit to touch the hem of her garment '' . 
`` person , get_a_grip_on yourself . 
it be not about you or person . 
i have some security information about the prime_minister '' . 
person look at him suspiciously through red-rimmed eye . 
`` not about me ? 
you mean it , person ? 
you would n't pull_the_leg_of my leg , old_man ? 
i did get you on the platform this morning '' . 
`` i 'm not pull_the_leg_of your leg . 
will you call that captain '' ? 
`` no use , he won n't come '' . 
he peer closely at person in the gathering darkness . 
`` what happen to your head '' ? 
`` i was hit - knock_out . 
now will you get him '' ? 
`` he say i 'm to take the message '' . 
he stare at person drunkenly . 
`` who 'd hit you in the head '' ? 
`` it does n't matter . 
you get_back to the captain and tell him this : somebody 's going_to take a shot at the prime_minister , and person be in_on the plot . 
tell him under no circumstance to trust the prime_minister with person '' . 
person say , `` that be impossible . 
person be the ambassador '' . 
`` nevertheless it be true '' . 
`` impossible '' . 
person was try to clear his head of the champagne fuzz that encase it . 
`` i 'll show you how wrong you be . 
person and the prime_minister be alone right now '' . 
he nod triumphantly . 
`` so that prove it '' ! 
person look terrified . 
`` where be they '' ? 
`` where 'd you expect , the john ? 
person 's office '' . 
`` where be that '' ? 
`` face us , two flight up . 
look , old_man , you can n't go_up . 
they won n't even let you in the front_door . 
so why do n't you be a good boy and '' - 
person grab him by the shoulder . 
`` listen to me , person . 
if you want to spend another day in the state_department - another day - you get_in there and tell that captain what i tell you '' . 
he bite_out the words . 
`` and you know i can do it '' . 
person raise placating hand . 
`` easy_does_it , person . 
i was just go . 
i be on my way '' . 
he turn and flee into the house and make_one's_way his way up the marble stairs without once look_back . 
on the second landing he pause to look_for person , did n't see him , and accept a glass of champagne . 
he take several large swallow , recollect that person had go_up another flight , and decide he would be wise to cover himself by find him . 
the way person be , no tell what he might say or do . 
he finish his champagne and climb uncertainly to the next landing . 
at the top a uniformed officer block further progress . 
`` yes , what is it '' ? 
he ask . 
`` i want person '' . 
he spot person come_out of a room at the far end of the corridor and call to him . 
person say , `` it 's okay , person , let him by '' . 
they walk toward each other . 
`` well '' ? 
person say , `` person tell me to tell you '' - he wait until they be close ; it be hideously embarrassing - `` not to let the prime_minister be alone with person '' . 
person look half crocked to the captain ; it would be just like him . 
`` why not '' ? 
`` he claim person be in a plot to kill the pm . '' . 
person go taut : be it possible ? 
could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime_minister fear ? 
not possible , he think ; the prime_minister know who his enemy be here ; he was n't going_to allow himself to be lead meekly to the slaughter . 
and if by some wild chance person be the man , he would n't dare try anything now - not after person had look_into on the two of them to see that all be well . 
person be damned if he would make a fool of himself again the way he had earlier over the laundry_truck . 
one more muddleheaded play like that one and they 'd be lead him away . 
still , this had to be check_out . 
`` where 'd your friend person get his information '' ? 
he ask . 
`` have n't the faint , captain '' . 
`` would you mind send him up_here ? 
i 'd like to talk to him '' . 
troubled , he continue along the corridor , poke his head into the next office for a careful look around . 
but person had not stay_on the front steps when person disappear into the building . 
he be unwilling to rely_on person 's carry his message , and he have no confidence the police would act_on it . 
if person be alone with the prime_minister he could be arrange his execution while person stand out here shiver in the darkening street . 
he would have to do something on_his_own . 
but what ? 
the door open and three man and a woman in a sari sweep past him and down_the_stairs . 
in the lighted interior he see other man and woman struggle into their wrap . 
these be the early departure ; in half an hour the reception would be over . 
if person was plan to set_up the prime_minister for person he would have to do it in the next few minute . 
person descend the stone steps to the street and look up at the building . 
wide window with many small leaded pane sweep across the upper story . 
on the second floor he see the animated face of the party guest ; the scene look_like a christmas_card . 
on the third floor one of the two window be lighted ; it be framed in maroon drape , and no face be visible . 
this would be person 's office . 
he and the prime_minister would be back from the window , seated at person 's desk ; they would be go_over papers person had save as excuse for just such a meeting . 
in a minute , or five minute , the business would be done ; person would stand_up , the prime_minister would follow . 
person would direct the prime_minister 's attention to something out the window and would guide him forward and_then step to one side . 
the single shot would come ; person would carry its sound to his grave . 
person , of_course , would be desolate . 
how was he to suspect that an assassin had been lurk somewhere across the street wait for just such a chance ? 
person turn . 
where across the street ? 
where was person wait with the rifle ? 
narrow four story building run the length of the block like book tightly pack on a shelf . 
most_of them could be eliminate ; person 's would have to be one of the half_dozen almost directly opposite . 
the legation was generously set back from the building line ; if the angle of fire be too great the jutting building on either side would interfere . 
would the shot come from a roof ? 
he run his eye along the roof coping ; almost at_once a figure bulk up . 
but dully glint on the dark form were the button and badge of a policeman . 
with a cop patrol the road person would have to be inside a building - if he be here at_all , and not wait for the prime_minister somewhere between this street and the terminal building at location . 
person cross the narrow street , squeeze between parked car to reach the sidewalk . 
from this side he could see far into the legation 's third story window , but he see no face ; the room 's occupant be still seat or they had been call into the hallway by an alarmed police_captain . 
if only the latter be true . 
he walk rapidly along the building scan their facade : one be a club - that be out ; two other he rule_out because all their window be lighted . 
that leave three , possibly four , one look much like the next . 
he climb the steps of the first and open the door to the vestibule . 
he quickly close it again . 
he had assume that all these building had been divide into apartment , but this one , from a glance at the hall furnishings , be obviously still a functioning town_house , and its owner be in residence ; that make it doubtful as the hiding_place of a man whose plan had to be make in_advance . 
he go_on to the next building and find what he expect - the mingle cooking aroma of a public vestibule . 
on one wall be the brass front of a row of mailbox ; there were six apartment . 
now what ? 
the name on the mailbox mean nothing to him . 
this be senseless - he have no idea what to look_for . 
he peer in the mailbox themselves ; all be empty except one , and that one be jammed with letter and magazine . 
the occupant of apartment number 3 be probably away for a_few day , and not likely to return on a friday . 
had person make the same deduction ? 
person was attract to the lore of mailbox . 
he open the inner door ; the cooking odor be strong - all_over the city , at this hour , housewife would be fuss over stove . 
he climb , as quickly as he could urge his body , up the two unbroken flight to the third floor , pull himself along on a delicate balustrade , all that remain of the building 's beauty . 
he pause on the landing to steady his breathing and_then bend to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb overhead . 
now he be certain : the lock had not yield to person 's collection of key ; fresh scar show that the door had been prise open . 
it had been shut again , but the lock be broken ; he note with a thrill of fear that the door move under his touch . 
what was he to do now ? 
he had think no further than find person . 
he realize now he had more_than half hope he would n't find him - that person would not be here , that the attempt would be schedule for somewhere beyond person 's control . 
he could not break_in on an armed man . 
he would have to climb_down back down to the street and signal a cop . 
be there time ? 
his thought were scatter by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door . 
person push open the door : at the far end of the long dark room person was faintly silhouette against the window , the rifle still raise ; he stand with his foot apart on a kitchen_table he had drag to the sill . 
he turn his head to the source of the disturbance and instantly back to the window and his rifle sight , dismiss person for_the_moment with the same contempt he had show in their encounter at person 's apartment . 
person stretch his left_hand to the wall and fumble for the switch : evil flourish in the dark . 
the room was bathe in light at the instant person 's second shot come . 
person , nakedly expose at the bright window like a deer pin in a car 's headlight , throw down the rifle and turn to jump from the table ; his face wear a look of outrage . 
a shot catch him and straighten him up in screaming pain ; a following volley of shot shatter glass , rip the ceiling , and send him lurch heavily from the table . 
he be dead before his body make contact with the floor . 
person stumble back into the hall , lean_against the wall , and start to retch . 
after person send person for person he be able to complete his detailed inspection of the third floor and to receive a report from his man cover the floor above before person return , buoy_up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne . 
the safe at group stand next to the gum machine in a narrow passageway that lead to person 's office ( to the left ) , the lieutenant 's office ( far along and to the left ) and the janitor 's supply_closet ( straight ahead ) . 
the safe be a repository for three dead flashlight_battery , a_hundred and fifty unused left-hand fingerprint card , a stack of unsold policemen's_ball ticket from last year , and thirty-seven cent in coin and stamp . 
person set the captain 's fifth of hiram_walker inside the safe before he report to person , though he know that person 's ulcer prevent him from make any untoward incursion on person 's gift . 
it be more a matter of tact , and also it be none of person 's goddam business . 
he walk up_to the lieutenant 's office , lean wearily against the gun rack that house four rifle and a gas_gun nobody remember having use and a submachine_gun that was occasionally try_out on the group . 
he stare at the clerk who sit at a scarred and ancient fumed_oak desk stuff envelope . 
`` where 's the person '' ? 
the clerk wag his head toward the captain 's office . 
person go to the connecting door , which be open , and stand at attention while person , in full uniform , finish comb his hair . 
the lieutenant 's sparse brown hair be heavily pomaded , and as person rake the comb through it , it stick together in thatch so that it look_like umbrella rib cling to his pink skull . 
the lieutenant eye person 's reflection in the mirror over the washbowl and_then glance back at his own face , move the comb methodically around his head . 
leave me alone , person think . 
fight with person , fight with the whole damned group . 
but leave me alone . 
because i 'm look_for the son_of_a_bitch that kill that old_man , and i 'm going_to get him . 
if you just leave me to hell alone , person . 
person peer through half closed lid at his reflection , thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and about-face . 
person wait for person to sit_down behind the desk near the window . 
he sit stiff-backed in a chair that did not swivel , though it be obvious to person that person feel his position as acting captain plainly merit a swivel_chair . 
the desk before him be in no better repair than the rest of the furniture crowd into the room , include wooden file_cabinet with some of their pull yank off and a wardrobe stain with the roof seepage of countless season . 
person pull one thin leg up , clamp his arm around the shinbone to press his knee into an incredibly scrawny gut . 
it be the posture which the man had come to recognize as that of person defy his ulcer . 
he put his chin on his kneecap , stretch his neck like that of a turkey on a chopping_block , and stare wordlessly at his sergeant . 
person wait . 
the 7_:_45 bell ring and he could hear the outside_door bang shut , close in the assembled day_watch . 
finally , person intone through his hawk_nose , `` we can n't have people run in any time they please , person '' . 
`` no , sir '' . 
`` run in , run out . 
ca n't have it . 
make_for confusion and congestion '' . 
he rock back in the chair , knee lock against stomach , his beady eye fixed on person . 
he be silent again , possibly listen to the sound in the squadroom . 
roll was being call . 
person clear his throat . 
person say , `` you were expect to report to my office twenty minute ago , person . 
that 's not get all the juice out of the orange , now be it '' ? 
`` no , sir '' . 
then person smile . 
person know that nothing but ace back-to-back would give the lieutenant an ulcer and a smile at_the_same_time . 
the day_watch platoon commander , person , was call_out the beat assignment , but person could n't make the name mean anything . 
`` i call the station at three this morning '' , person 's nasal voice pronounce . 
`` do you have any idea who might have be in_charge at the time '' ? 
`` person , sir '' . 
`` now , now , you 're just guess , person '' . 
he smile thinly , savor his joke . 
`` what if i say nobody be here but a_couple_of patrolman '' ? 
`` sir , person know better than to leave the station without a relief . 
he must have '' - 
`` he let a patrolman take_over the duty of the station_keeper . 
now that be not regulation , be it '' ? 
`` no , sir '' . 
`` but you did n't know a thing about it , did you '' ? 
person lean forward ; his foot slip off the chair and he put_back it back again , frown now . 
`` that 's not take one 's command with a responsible attitude , person '' . 
person tell himself that the old bastard be a fool . 
but stupidity be no consolation when it have rank . 
`` i be out in the district , sir '' . 
`` oh , yes . 
so i have hear '' . 
he stretch a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk . 
`` i might point_out that your inability to report to my office this morning when you were instruct to do so has not , ah , limit my knowledge of your activity as you may have hope '' . 
he take_up a white sheet_of_paper , dark with single-spaced data . 
a car pull into the driveway outside the window . 
person know it be car_12 , the wagon , return from deliver location 's drunk-and-disorderly to the location . 
but for some fool reason he could n't remember which man he 'd put on the transfer detail . 
he stare at the report in person 's hand , sure it was write by person - just as sure as if he 'd submit it in his scrawled longhand . 
he suck_in his breath and keep quiet while person lay down the sheet again , wind the gold wire stem of his glasses around his ear and_then , eye the report as it lie before him on the desk , intone , `` person one fail to see that the station_keeper was properly relieve two absent himself throughout the entire watch without check on the station 's activity or the whereabouts of his section sergeant three permit member of the homicide_detail of the group to arrogate for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevent from carry_on his proper assignment four fail to notify the station commander person of a homicide occur in the district five frequent extralegal establishment known_as after-hours spot for purpose of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six '' - he lean_back and peel_off his glasses `` - fail to cooperate with the person by return promptly when so order . 
what have you to say to_that , person '' ? 
person sail the paper across the desk , but person did n't pick_up it up or even glance at it . 
`` well '' ? 
`` i did n't think person know so many big word , person '' . 
person lick his lip . 
`` person be an alert and conscientious law_enforcement officer . 
i do n't think his diligence mitigate your negligence , person '' . 
`` negligence , hell '' ! 
person hold his breath a moment , push the volume and pitch of his voice down under the trapdoor in his throat . 
`` sir . 
i would have be negligent and a goddam lousy cop to_boot , if i 'd sit around this station all night when somebody get_away with murder in my district . 
it 's too_bad i did n't call you , and it 's too_bad i let person use person when he could have have a boy who 'd be glad to learn something of homicide procedure . 
but i be not one damned bit sorry i go_out to question the people i know in the place they hang_around , and '' - 
`` let 's not push our patience beyond the danger_line , person '' , person nasale . 
`` i should n't like to have to write_up you up for insubordination as_well as dereliction of duty '' . 
person stiffen , his hand ball into fist at his side . 
he clamp his jaw to keep the fury from spill_out . 
an argument with person be as frustrating and as futile as a cap pistol on a firing_range . 
person lean forward again , rock comfortably with his arm still wrap around one knee . 
`` let 's just remember , person , that we must all carry_our_own_umbrella . 
a district station can n't run smoothly , unless '' - he interrupt himself , look around person at the doorway . 
`` morning , person '' . 
`` sorry , person . 
i think you had n't come_in yet '' . 
`` i 've be here for some time '' . 
he stand_up , cock his head and eye person coldly . 
`` the sergeant is just leave '' . 
it had come as no great surprise to person that the hot water in the shower did n't work , that person had throw_up all_over the stairs , or that some thieving bastard of a cop had walk_off with his cigarette . 
it was the best he could hope for on a watch that had end with a session in person 's office . 
now , as he pass the open counter that divide the assembly room from the business office , he nod and say good_night to the station_keeper and his clerk , not stop to hear the day_watch playback of his chewing_out . 
not that he gave a damn what the grapevine send_out about person 's little speech on the comportment of platoon commander . 
he just did n't want to talk_about it . 
if the acting captain want his acting lieutenant to sit on his ass around the station all night , person would just have to go_out and drag person back by the heel once an hour ; because he 'd be damned if he was going_to be a midwatch pencil_pusher just to please his ulcerated pro_tem captain . 
at the doorway he squint up at the gray morning overcast and pat his jacket pocket for the cigarette , remember then that he 'd leave them at the group . 
he could pick_up another pack on his way home , if he were go_home . 
but even before he start across the oiled road to his plymouth , park in the lot under the cypress_tree across from the station , he know that he was n't go_home . 
not_yet . 
it was nine o'clock in the morning : the hour which , like a spade turn clod of earth , expose to the day a myriad of busy creature that had lie_dormant in the quiet night . 
location at this hour was populate by a whole community that person could not have see on his tour of duty - the neighborhood that had know person by day . 
person had purchase the group seventeen year ago . 
it be professedly worth three thousand dollar in stock and good_will , and the name be written in gold in foot high letter across each of the two display_window . 
on the right window , at eye level , in smaller print but also in gold , be person , prop. , and under_that , se_habla_espanol . 
person take a razor to person , prop. , but leave the promise that spanish would be understand because he think it mean that spanish clientele would be welcome . 
language be no problem anyway ; person had only to signal from his doorway to summon aid from the ubiquitous bilingual child who play on the sidewalk of location . 
aside from the fact that business be slow this time_of_year and his one salesgirl be not the most enterprising , person have no worry at_all , and he say as much to person , who sit across from him in civilian clothes , on a jiffy-couch-a-bed , mauve velour , $ 79.89 nothing down special ! 
`` she be honest_as_the_day '' , person say , and add , `` person , i can say this to you : person be a_little too honest . 
you can n't tell a customer how much it 's going_to cost him to refinance his payment before he even sign for a loan on the money down ! 
a time_plan be a mere convenience , you understand , and when '' - he interrupt himself , smile . 
`` i put her in lamp . 
that way i do n't lose so much '' . 
`` why do n't you just hire somebody else '' ? 
`` she say she has to finish a story '' . 
he shrug . 
`` i ask her why she could n't do it tomorrow , but it seem the muse is work good tonight and she 's afraid to let_it_go '' . 
person make some comment , but his mind be busy as he consider the man . 
his name be person and he , too , had come from a good family . 
he be perhaps thirty-two , nicely set_up , with light_brown hair that have a pronounced wave . 
he be always well groomed and well tailored , and he have that rich_man 's look which be authentic enough and come from two good prep_school and a proper university . 
an only child , he had do all the thing that young_man do who have been bear to money and social position until his father double_cross him by die broke . 
since then he had work_at this and that , though some say his main interest be gambling . 
all this go through person 's mind in the first instant , but what hold his interest was the fact that these two should be together at_all . 
for he had understand that person had been engage to a boy name person . 
she had grow_up with young person , and he had hear that they had been at the point of marry at_least twice . 
he want to ask her about person now , but he know he could n't do so in person 's presence . 
and so , still wonder and a_little perplexed , he grin at the girl and speak lightly to make_sure that she would know he was kid . 
`` where did you pick_up him up '' ? 
`` oh , i 've know him quite a while '' . 
she glance at her companion fondly . 
`` have n't i , person '' ? 
`` i 've been_after her for years '' , person say , `` but i 've never been able to get anywhere until the last few day '' . 
the girl 's eye were softly shine as she reach_out and touch person 's hand . 
`` can i tell you a secret ? 
we 're going_to get_married . 
do you approve '' ? 
person keep his smile fixed , but some small inner disturbance was work_on him as he think again about person , who be eight or ten year old than the girl . 
he wonder whether person was going_to swear_off gambling and get a steady job or whether he was count_on the income from person 's estate to subsidize him . 
none of_this show in his face , and he try to keep his skepticism in_hand . 
he make a point of frown , of act_out the part of the fond father confessor . 
`` i 'll have to give it some thought '' , he say . 
`` you would n't want me to say yes without make sure his intention be honorable , would you '' ? 
she make a face at him and then she laugh . 
`` of_course not '' . 
`` i 'll get my reference in_order '' , person say , and though he speak with a smile , person somehow get the idea that he be not particularly amused . 
`` stop_by any time , person '' . 
he stand_up and touch the girl 's arm . 
`` come on , darling . 
if you be really serious about work_on that story , i 'd better take you home '' . 
person watch them go , still frown absently and_then dismiss the matter as he call_for his check . 
as he go_out he tell person the dinner be perfect , and when he get his hat and coat from person and put a fifty-cent_piece in the slot , he tell her to be sure that it go toward her dowry . 
a taxi take him back to the bar and grill where he had leave his car , and a_few minute later he find a parking_space across the street from his apartment . 
because his mind had been otherwise occupy for the past couple of hour , he did not think to look and see if person 's car be still there . 
in_fact , he did not think_about person at_all until he enter his living_room and close the door behind him . 
only then , when his glance focus_on the divan and see that it be empty , did he remember his earlier problem . 
even from where he stand he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread_over person , the pillow , the sheet_of_paper on top of it . 
then he was stride across the room , his thought confused but the worry build swiftly inside him as he snatch_up the note . 
person : 
look in the wastebasket . 
i know the only way i could beat you was to play_possum , but it be a good try , kid , and i appreciate it . 
j. . 
the wastebasket stand near the wall next to the divan , and the instant person pick_up it up he know what had happen . 
the discarded papers inside be sodden , there be a glint of liquid at the bottom , and the smell of whisky be strong and distinct . 
he put the wastebasket down distastefully , mutter softly and thoroughly disgusted with himself and his plan that had seem so foolproof . 
for he remember too well how he had bring back the loaded drink to person and_then return to the kitchen to get weak drink for himself . 
for another second or two he give_in to the annoyance that was direct at himself ; then his mind move_on to be confront by something far more serious , and as the thought expand , the implication jar him . 
it no_longer matter that person had outsmart him . 
the important thing be that person had go somewhere to meet a blackmailer with a gun in his pocket . 
and that gun be empty . 
even before his mind had round_out the idea , he thrust one hand into his trouser pocket and pull_out the six slug he had take from the revolver . 
he consider them with brooding eye , brow bunch as his brain grapple with the problem and try to find some solution . 
he say : `` the crazy fool '' , half aloud . 
he put the shell on the table , as though he could no_longer bear to hold them . 
he think : where the hell could he have go ? 
how can i find him ? 
there be no answer to this and he begin to pace back_and_forth across the room , his imagination out of control . 
he try to tell himself that maybe person had sober_up enough to get some sense . 
maybe he only intend to scare the blackmailer , whoever he be , in_which_case an unloaded gun would be good_enough . 
he think_of other possibility , none of them satisfactory , and finally he begin to think , to wonder if there be some way he could reach person . 
then , as he turn toward the telephone , it ring shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reach for it eagerly . 
`` yeah '' , he say . 
`` person '' ? 
`` yeah '' . 
`` person '' . 
person hear the voice distinctly and he know who it be , but it take him a while to make the mental readjustment and control the disturbance inside his head . 
when he hear person say : `` what about that picture you take this afternoon '' ? it still take him another few second to remember the job he had do for person . 
`` what picture '' ? he demand . 
`` you take a picture of me at the corner of location and location about three_thirty this afternoon '' . 
`` who say so '' ? 
`` one of my boy '' . 
person believe that much . 
person be not the sort who walk_around without one of his `` boy '' close_at_hand . 
`` so '' ? 
`` with my trial come_up in federal_court next week i would n't want that picture publish '' . 
`` who say it 's going to be publish '' ? 
`` i would n't even want it to get_around '' . 
under normal circumstance person be a_little fussy when people tell him what to do with picture he had take . 
even_so , he generally listen and be usually reasonable to those who voice their objection properly . 
right now , however , he was still too worry about person , and the gun that have no bullet , and the story person had tell him , to care too_much about person . 
his nerves were get a_little ragged and his impatience put an edge in his voice . 
`` look '' , he say . 
`` i was hire to take a picture . 
i take it . 
that be all i know about it and that be all i care '' . 
`` maybe you 'd well tell the guy who hire you what i say '' . 
`` you tell him '' . 
`` all_right '' , person say , his voice still quiet . 
`` but i mean what i say , person . 
if that picture get_around and i find_out you have anything to do with it , i 'm going_to send a_couple_of my boy around to see you '' . 
`` you do that '' , person say . 
`` just be sure to send your two best boy , person '' . 
he hang_up with a bang , annoyed at himself for running_off_at_the_mouth like that but still terribly concern with the situation he had help to create . 
as_soon_as he could think logically again he reach for the telephone_directory and find person 's home number . 
he dial it and listen to it ring ten time before he hang_up . 
he call the bar and grill where he had pick_up person up that afternoon . 
when he was tell that no one had see person since then , he think_of three other place that be possibility . 
each time he get the same answer and in_the_end he give_up . 
by the time he had smoke three cigarette he had calm_down . 
he had do all he could and that be that . 
and anyway person be not the kind of guy who would be likely to get in_trouble even when he be drunk . 
he , person , had been scare for_a_while , but that had come mostly from the fact that he feel responsible . 
he should have stay here and watch person . 
he did n't . 
so he make a mistake . 
so what ? 
he keep tell himself this as he go_out to the kitchen to make a drink . 
only then did he decide he did n't want one . 
he consider open a can of beer but veto that idea too . 
finally he go_into the bedroom and sit_down to take_off his shoe . 
he had just finish unlace the right one when the telephone ring again . 
when he snatch it up the voice that come to him be quick and urgent . 
`` person ? 
you do n't know me but i know you . 
if you want a picture get to the corner of location and location just as fast as you can . 
if you hurry you might beat the headquarters boy '' . 
person hear the click of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth , and it take him no more than three second to decide . 
for over the year he had receive many such call . 
some of them come from people who identify themselves . 
some telephone because he had do them a favor in the past . 
others because they expect some sort of reward for the information . 
a_few pass along a tip for the simple reason that they like him and want to give him a break . 
only an occasional tip turn_out to be a phony , and , like the police , person had make a point of run_down all such suggestion and he did not hesitate this time . 
he be in his car with his camera and equipment bag in less_than two minute , and it take him only three more to reach the corner , a block from location . 
it be a district of small factory and loft building and occasional tenement , and he could see the police_car as he round the corner and slam_on the brake . 
he did not bother with his radio - there would be time for that later - but as he scramble out on the pavement he see the filling_station and the public telephone_booth and know instantly how he had been summon . 
the police_car had pull_up behind a small sedan , its headlight still on . 
miraculously , she find exactly the right statement . 
she begin it deliberately , so that none of her words would be lost on him . 
`` i want to tell you something person . 
i be well aware that you 've have_got a pedigree as long as my leg , and that i do n't amount to anything . 
but '' - 
`` but it do n't matter a-tall '' , person supply fondly . 
`` to me you 'll always be the girl o ' my dream , an ' the sweet flower that grow '' . 
beam idiotically , he pooch out his lip and attempt to kiss her . 
she yank away from him furiously . 
`` you shut_up ! 
shu-tt up-pp ! 
i 've have_got something to say to you , and by god you 're going to listen . 
do you hear me ? 
you 're going to listen '' ! 
person nod agreeably . 
he say he want very_much to listen . 
he know that anything a brainy little lady like her have to say would be plumb important , as_well_as pleasing ' to the ear , and he did n't want to miss a word of_it . 
so would she mind speak a_little loud ? 
`` i think you stink , person ! 
i think you be mean and hateful and stupid , and - loud '' ? say person . 
`` uh-huh . 
so i can hear you while i 'm check ' the car . 
look like we might be in_for a speck of trouble '' . 
he open the door and get_out . 
he wait at the car side for a moment , look down at her expectantly . 
`` well ? 
was n't you goin ' to say somethin '' ' ? 
then , helpfully , as she merely stare at him in weary silence , `` maybe you could write_down it down for me , huh ? 
print it in real big letter , an ' i can cipher it out later '' . 
`` aah , go_on '' , she say . 
`` just go the hell on '' . 
he grin , nod , and walk_around to the front of the car . 
lip purse mournfully , he stare down at its crazily sagging left side . 
then he hunker_down on the heel of his handmade boot , peer into the orderly chaos of axle , shock_absorber , and spring . 
he go prone on his stomach , the_better to pursue his examination . 
after a time , he straighten again , brush the red permian dust from his hand , slap it from his six dollar levis and his tailored , twenty-five dollar shirt . 
he wear no gun - a strange omission for a peace_officer in this country . 
never , he 'd once tell person , had he encounter any man or situation that call_for a gun . 
and he really feel that way , she think . 
that be really all he 's get , all he be . 
just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package . 
if i could make myself feel the same way . 
she study him hopefully , yearningly ; against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it be easy to confirm her analysis . 
here in the godforsaken place , the westerly end of nowhere , person look almost insignificant , almost contemptible . 
he be handsome , with his coal-black hair and eye , his fine chiseled feature . 
but she 'd know plenty of handsome guy , and , concede his good_looks , what was there leave ? 
he be n't a big man ; rather on the medium side . 
neither be he very powerful of build . 
he could move very quickly , she know ( although he seldom find occasion to do so ) , but he be more wiry than truly strong . 
and his relatively small hand and foot give him an almost delicate appearance . 
just nothing , she tell herself . 
just so darned sure of himself that he puts_the_indian_sign on everyone . 
but , by gosh , i want him and i 'm going_to have him ! 
he catch her eye , come_back around the car with the boot wearer 's teeter , half mincing walk . 
why did these yokel still wear boot , anyway , when most had scarcely sit a horse in year ? 
he slide in at her side , tuck a cigar into his mouth , and politely proffer one to her . 
`` oh , cut_it_out , person '' ! she snap . 
`` ca n't you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute '' ? 
`` this ai n't your brand , maybe '' , person suggest . 
`` or maybe you just do n't feel_like a cigar '' ? 
`` i feel_like get_back to town , that be what i feel_like ! 
now , are you going_to take me or am i supposed_to walk '' ? 
`` might get there faster walk '' ' , person drawl , `` see ' as how i have_got a busted front spring . 
on_the_other_hand , howsomever , maybe you would n't either . 
i figger it be probably a sixty-five mile walk , and i c_'_n maybe get this spring patch_up in a_couple_of hour '' . 
`` how - with what ? 
there 's nothing out here but rattlesnake '' . 
`` now , ai n't it the truth '' ? 
person laugh with secret amusement . 
`` not a danged thing but rattlesnake , so i reckon i 'll get the boss rattler to help me '' . 
`` person ! 
for_god 's sake '' ! 
`` looky '' . 
he point , cut_off her off . 
`` see that wildcat '' ? 
she see it then , the distant derrick of the wildcat - a test well in unexplored country . 
and even with her limited knowledge of such thing , she know that the car could be repair there ; sufficiently , at_least , to get them back into town . 
a wildcatter had to be prepared for almost any emergency . 
he had_to depend_on himself , since he be invariably mile and hour away from others . 
`` well , let 's get_going '' , she say impatiently . 
`` i '' - she break_off , frown . 
`` what did you mean by that rattlesnake gag ? 
get the boss rattlesnake to help you '' ? 
`` why , i mean what i say '' , person declare . 
`` what else would i mean , anyways '' ? 
she look at him , lip compress . 
then , with a shrug of pretended indifference , she take a compact from her purse and went_through_the_motions of fix her makeup . 
in his mood , it be the best way to handle him ; that_is , to show no curiosity whatsoever . 
otherwise , she would be bait into a tantrum - tease and provoke until she lose control of herself , and thus lose still another battle in the maddening struggle of person vs. person . 
the car lurch along at a snail 's crawl , the left front mudguard bang and scrape against the tire , occasionally scrape against the road itself . 
person whistle tunelessly as he fight the steering_wheel . 
he seem very pleased with himself , as though some intricate scheme was work_out exactly as he had plan . 
along with this self-satisfaction , however , person sense a growing tension . 
it pour out of him like an electric_current , a feeling that the muscle and nerve of his fine drawn body were coil for action , and that that action would be all that he anticipate . 
person had see him like this once before - more_than once , actually , but on one particularly memorable occasion . 
that be the day that he had practically mopped_up the main_street of location with person , field boss for the group . 
person had been lay for person for a long_time , just wait to catch him out of line . 
person give him his opportunity when he show_up in town with a pistol on his hip . 
he have a legitimate reason for wear it . 
it was payday for highlands , and he was pack a lot of money back into the oilfield . 
moreover , as_long_as the weapon was carry openly , the sheriff 's office had make no previous issue of_it . 
`` so what 's this all about '' ? he demand , when person confront him . 
i be not the only man in town with a gun , or the only one without a permit `` . 
it be the wrong thing to say . 
by fail to do as he was tell instantly - to take_out a permit or return the gun to his car - he had play into person 's hand . 
the trouble be that he had virtually had_to protest . 
the deputy had force him to by his manner of accost him . 
so , `` how about it '' ? he say . 
`` why single_out me out on this permit deal '' ? 
`` well , i 'll tell you about that '' , person tell him . 
`` we aim t ' be selective , y_'_know ? 
do n't like to bother no_one unless we have to , which i figger we do , in your case . 
figger we got_to be plumb careful with any of you group big_shot '' . 
person redden . 
he himself had hear that there was gangster money in the company , but that have nothing to do with him . 
he be an honest man do a hard job , and the implication that he be anything else be unbearable . 
`` look , person '' , he say hoarsely . 
`` i know you have_got a grudge against me , and maybe i can n't blame you . 
you think that group swindle you and i help ' em do it . 
but you be all wrong , man ! 
i be no lawyer . 
i just do what i 'm told , and '' - 
`` uh-huh . 
an ' that could mean trouble with a fella that 's work ' for crook . 
so you get_rid_of that pistol right now , person . 
you do that or take_out you out a permit right now '' . 
person could n't do either , of_course . 
not immediately , as the deputy demand . 
not without a face-saving respite of at_least a_few minute . 
to do so would make his job well-nigh impossible . 
oilfield worker be a rough tough lot . 
how could he exert authority over them - make them toe_the_line , as he have to - if he knuckle_under to this small_town clown ? 
`` i 'll get_around_to it a_little later '' , he mumble desperately . 
`` just as_soon_as i go to the bank , and '' - 
`` huh-uh . 
now , person '' , say person , and he lay a firmly restrain hand on the field boss 's arm . 
it be strictly the deputy 's game , but person had go too far to throw_in . 
now , he could only play the last card in what be probably the world 's cold deck . 
he fling off person 's hand and attempt to push past him , inadvertently shove him into a storefront . 
it be practically the last move that person make of his own volition . 
person slug him in the stomach , so hard that the organ almost press against his spine . 
then , as he double , gasp , vomit the breakfast he had so lately eat , person straighten him with an uppercut . 
a rabbit_punch redouble him . 
and_then there was a numbing blow to the heart , and another gut flatten blow to the stomach . 
but he could n't keep_up with them . 
no_more could he defend himself against them . 
he seem to be fight not one man but a dozen . 
and he could no_longer think_of face_saving , of honor , but only of escape . 
why , he 's go to kill me , he think wildly . 
i mean him no harm . 
i 've give willful hurt to no man . 
i was just do my job , just follow order , and for that he 's going to kill me . 
beat me to death in_front_of a_hundred people . 
somehow more terrible than the certainty that he be about to die be the knowledge that person would probably not suffer for it : the murder would go unpunished . 
he , person , would be cite as in the wrong , and he , person , would go scot_free , an officer who had only do his duty , though perhaps too energetically . 
person stagger into the street , flop sprawl in the stinging dust . 
fear maddened , flee the lengthening shadow of death , he scramble to his foot again . 
he could n't see ; he be long past the point of coherent thinking . 
dimly , he hear laughter , hoot of derision , but he could not read the racket properly . 
he could not grasp that person had withdraw from the fight minute ago , and that his leaden arm were flail at nothing but the air . 
he hate them too_much to understand - the people of_this isolated law unto itself world that be person 's world . 
this , he be sure , be the way they would act ; laugh_at a dying man , laugh as a man was beat to death . 
and nothing would be do about it . 
nothing unless & & & . 
person ! 
person , his young wife , the girl who be both daughter and wife to him . 
person be like he be . 
she live by the rule , never compromise , never blind or divert by circumstance . 
and person would - 
when he regain consciousness he be in person 's house , in the office of person , the deputy 's deceased father . 
the person outfit - known as the group because of its brand - reach location before sundown . 
the herd was water and_then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night 's bedground . 
two of the new hand , a mexican named person and a kid known only as person , were pick for the first trick of ride_herd night herd . 
the rest of the crew offsaddle their mount and turn them into the remuda . 
they get tin cup of coffee from the big pot on the coosie 's fire , roll and light brown paper cigarette , lounge_about . 
there was some idle_talk , a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the day 's drive . 
but they deliberately avoid the one subject that have them all curious : 
the failure of the boss 's wife and son to join the outfit . 
it especially bother the old hand . 
the cook , person , had arrive there long before the herd . 
he 'd start a fire and put_on coffee on , and now be busy at the workboard of his chuck_wagon . 
he was ready a batch of sourdough biscuit for the dutch_oven . 
supper would be ready within the hour . 
the person family was set_up a separate camp nearby . 
person had unhitch the mule from both person 's and his father 's wagon . 
person had gather wood for a cookfire , and his wife be busy at it now . 
person keep_an_eye_on the twin and little person , try to keep them from fall into the creek by which they persist in play . 
person nag at the young child , attempt without success to keep her thought off person . 
person had catch_up_with the outfit shortly after the person join it , which had be at midday . 
he 'd come alone , without his wife and child . 
he 'd be in an angry mood : person had think his face almost ugly with the anger in him . 
she wonder what had take_place in town , between him and his wife . 
she wish that she could talk to her mother about it . 
not that her mother know what had happen , but they could speculate upon it . 
but her mother would rebuke her if she mention it , and say that it be none of her concern . 
`` person , get_out of that creek ! 
you too , person ! 
person , you 'll get mud all_over your dress '' ! 
even as she call to the child , person let her gaze seek person . 
person , she call him - as the mexican hand did . 
he be in earnest conversation with her father and the old vaquero , person . 
whatever they are talk_about ? 
person wonder . 
it bother her that she probably would never know . 
certainly , she would n't dare ask her father afterward . 
he would tell her not to pry into grownup ' affairs - as though she be a little kid like person ! 
at the moment , the three man were not say much of anything . 
they were sit on their heel , rider fashion , over by the still empty calf wagon . 
person be hunkered_down with his broad back to the left rear wheel , with the other two face him . 
he hold a cigarette in his right_hand . 
it was burn away , forgotten . 
his face be clouded with unhappiness . 
he 'd tell person and person about his wife 's refusal to come_with him and about what he now intend to do . 
they were consider it gravely , neither seem to like what he plan . 
finally person say , `` i could offer you advice , person , but you would n't heed it '' . 
`` let 's hear it , anyway '' . 
`` wait a little while . 
let person live in her father 's house for a time . 
give her time to miss you . 
maybe she will then come to you . 
after_all , you want the senora as_much_as you want the boy . 
you need her even more_than you need him '' . 
`` she won n't change her mind '' , person say . 
`` person will see to that '' . 
`` but after a time away from you & & & '' . 
`` a year , person ? 
five ? 
ten ? 
how long should i wait '' ? 
`` maybe in a year , person & & & '' . 
`` in a year she 'll like live in person 's house too_much to come_back to me '' , person say flatly . 
`` and the boy will be too_much under his influence by then . 
i 've got_to take_away person away from person before i lose him altogether . 
hell , in a year or five or ten , the boy will have forget me - his own father '' ! 
`` but to take him and leave_behind his mother behind be not good '' . 
`` in my place , you 'd follow such advice as you give me '' ? 
person look suddenly uncertain . 
`` that i can n't answer , for i can n't imagine something like this happen to me . 
maybe i should withdraw my advice - no '' ? 
person look at person . 
`` and you ? 
what would you do in my place '' ? 
person shake his head . 
`` i do n't know , person . 
like person , i can n't see something like this happen to me . 
with person and me , there 's never any problem . 
where i go , she go - and the kid with us . 
you 're going_to need your woman . 
and the boy will need his mother . 
if you take the one , you had_better take both '' . 
person shake his head . 
`` i won n't force person to come against her will . 
but i 'm going_to have my son '' . 
they be silent for a little while , each look glum . 
finally person say , `` what_must_be_,_must_be . 
i be with you , of_course , person '' . 
and person add , `` so be i , person '' . 
`` all_right '' , person say , rise . 
`` we 'll ride out as_soon_as we 've have chuck '' . 
person time it so that they ride in an hour after nightfall . 
they have for cover both darkness and a summer storm . 
during much of the fifteen mile ride they had watch a lurid display of lightning in the sky to the east . 
later , they 'd hear the rumble of thunder and_then , just outside location , they run_into rain . 
those who have slicker don them . 
the others put_on old coat or ducking jacket , whichever they carry behind their saddle cantle . 
there were seven of them , enough for a show of strength - to run a bluff . 
it was to be nothing more_than that . 
there was to be no gunplay . 
if the bluff fail and they run_into trouble , person had tell the others , they would withdraw - and he would come after his son another time . 
he did n't want to put himself outside the law . 
with him be person , person , and person 's son person . 
the person brother be also along . 
the seventh man be person , a wiry little puncher with a wild streak and a liking for hell_raising . 
they be all good man . 
it was dark early , because of the storm . 
also because of the storm , the street of location be deserted . 
lighted window glow jewel bright through the downpour . 
they rein_in before the town marshal 's office , a box sized building on location . 
a lamp burn inside , but person , peer through the window , see that the office be empty . 
he 'd hope to catch person there . 
`` probably just step_out '' , he say . 
`` maybe to have supper . 
person , come along . 
the rest of you wait here '' . 
with person , he ride to the location . 
person get_down from the saddle and have_a_look inside . 
`` not there '' , he say , get_on back onto his horse . 
`` maybe he be at the hotel '' . 
they ride to the location , a_little far along the opposite side of the street . 
they rein_in there , person remain in the saddle while person go to look_for person in the hotel dining_room . 
person have no slicker . 
he 'd put_on his old brown corduroy coat and it be already soaked . 
but he feel no physical discomfort . 
he be only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain . 
he hardly notice the blue green flash of lightning and the hard clap of thunder . 
person reappear , stop on the hotel porch , lift a hand in signal . 
person dismount and climb the steps . 
`` he 's finish eat '' , person say . 
`` sit with a cup of coffee now . 
it should n't be long '' . 
it seem long , at_least to person . 
he and person wait by the door , one to either side . 
person be the third man to come_out , and he come unhurriedly . 
he was puff on a cigar , and he was turn_up his coat collar against the rain . 
it was not until he move across the porch that he become aware of them , and_then it was too late . 
they close_in fast , keep him from reach inside his coat for his gun . 
`` just come along '' , person tell him . 
`` do n't start anything you can n't finish '' . 
`` now , listen '' - person begin . 
`` we 'll talk over at your office '' . 
`` person , i warn you '' ! 
`` let 's go , marshal '' , person say , and take him by the arm . 
person grip the lawman 's other arm . 
they escort him down from the porch and through the rain to his office . 
the other five group man follow them inside , crowd the small room . 
his face be stiff with anger when they let_go_of his arm . 
he look at each of them in_turn , person last of all . 
`` i 'll remember you '' , he say . 
`` every_last one of you . 
as for you , person '' - 
`` put your gun on the desk , marshal '' . 
`` now , hold_on , damn_it ; i won n't '' - 
person 's patience run_out . 
he lift the skirt of person 's coat , take his gun from its holster , toss it onto the desk . 
`` too_much fool_around '' , he say . 
`` do n't press_your_luck , badge toter '' . 
person say , `` now the key to the lockup , marshal '' . 
`` key '' ? 
person say . 
`` what for '' ? 
`` ca n't you guess '' ? 
person say . 
`` we 're put you where you won n't come to harm . 
come_on - the key . 
get_out it out '' ! 
`` damned if i will . 
person , you 've assault a law_officer and '' - 
they move_in_on him , crowd him from all side . 
no man lay a hand on him , but the threat of violence be there . 
his face take_on a sudden pallor , become beaded with sweat , and he seem to have trouble with his breathing . 
he hold_out a moment longer , then his nerve give under the pressure . 
he swear , and say , `` all_right . 
it be here in my pocket '' . 
`` get_out it out '' , person order . 
then , as person obey : `` now let 's go out back '' . 
resignedly , person turn to the back door . 
they follow him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty foot to the rear . 
the door of the lockup be of oak plank and band with strap iron . 
it be secured by an oversized padlock . 
person balk again , not want to unlock and open the door . 
they crowd him in that threatening way once_more , force him to give_in . 
once the door be open , they crowd him inside the dark building . 
he was utter threat in a low but savage voice when they close and padlock the door . 
they return to the street , mount their horse , ride through the rain to the big house on location . 
its window glow with lamplight . 
person still stand_guard on the veranda , a forlorn , scarecrowish figure in the murky dark . 
he come to the edge of the veranda , peer down at them with his hand on his gun . 
`` do n't try it '' , person tell him , dismount and start up the steps with his men follow . 
`` do n't get yourself kill for something that does n't concern you '' . 
he stride past the now frightened man , enter the house . 
person and person remain on the veranda to keep person from interfere . 
the others follow person inside . 
they trail him across the wide hallway to the parlor , four roughly garbed and tough look man who probably had never before venture into such a house . 
they bring to it all the odor that cling to man like themselves , that of their own sweat , of campfire smoke , of horse and cattle . 
they track mud on the oaken floor , on the carpet . 
their presence foul the elegance of that room . 
and their arrival catch person and person off_guard . 
the author of the anonymous note seem to be all-knowing . 
for man who had leave cattle alone after get their first notice had receive no second . 
but the day of the deadline come and pass , and the man who had scoff at the warning laugh with satisfaction . 
for , with a single exception , nothing had happen to them . 
the exception be an location settler name person . 
after walk out to his corral that morning , he 'd be amazed to see the dust puff_up in_front of his foot . 
a split_second later , the distant crack of a rifle had sound . 
he 'd mount_up immediately and race with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he 'd estimate the shot had come . 
but he had find all_of the thicket and point of cover deserted . 
there had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or trace to show that anyone had be near . 
person be a man who had make a full-time job of cow stealing . 
he had n't even pretend to be farm his spread . 
his land had never been plow . 
he had do his rustling openly and boast about it . 
he had receive both first and second anonymous notice , and each time he had accuse his neighbor of write them . 
he had curse at them and threaten them . 
he be a man , those neighbor testify later , who did n't have a friend in the world . 
person make the round of all who live near him again , that august morning after a bullet land at his foot , and once_more he accuse and threaten everyone . 
`` i 'll be ready next time '' ! he rage . 
`` i 'll be shoot ' right back '' . 
he have his chance the very next morning , for exactly the same thing happen again . 
this time person have his own rifle in his hand , and he throw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off shot , then spend most_of the day search out the area . 
he find nothing , but he still refuse to give_up and move out . 
`` just let me meet_up_with that damned bushwhacking ' coward face-to-face '' ! he explode . 
`` that be all i ask '' ! 
he never get that chance . 
for the unseen , ghostlike rifleman aim a_little high the third time . 
a .30-30 bullet smash directly into the center of person ' chest . 
he slump against a log fence_rail , then try to lift himself . 
two more shot follow in quick succession , drop him limp and huddled on the ground . 
an inquest was hold , and after a good_deal of testimony about the anonymous note , the county coroner estimate that the shooting had been do from a distance of 300 yard . 
rumor of the offer person had make at the group meeting had leak_out by then , and as a grand_jury investigation of the murder get underway , the prosecuting_attorney , a person , order that the tall stock detective be summon for questioning . 
it take some time to locate person . 
he was finally find in the location region of location , two county away . 
person immediately assume he was hide_out there after the shooting and begin prepare an indictment . 
but that indictment was never make . 
for person , it turn_out , have a number of rancher and cowboy witness ready and willing to swear with straight_face that he had be in location the day of the killing . 
the former scout 's alibi could n't be shake . 
the authorities had to release him . 
he immediately ride on to cheyenne , throw a ten day drinking spree and drop some very strong hint among friend . 
`` dead center at three hundred yard , that coroner say '' ! he 'd grin . 
`` three shot in_that fella ' fore he hit the ground ! 
you reckon there be two man in_this state can shoot like that '' ? 
publicly , he deny everything . 
privately , he create and magnify an image of himself as a hired assassin . 
for a blood chilling ring of terror to the very sound of his name be the tool he need for the job he 'd promise to do . 
person be soon back at_work , give his secret employer their money 's worth . 
a good many beef hungry settler were accept the death of person as proof that the warning note be not idle threat . 
the company herd were being raid less often , and cabin and soddy all_over the range were stand deserted . 
but there were other homesteader who pass_off the person murder off as a personal grudge killing , the work of one of his neighbor . 
the rustling problem be by_no_means solved . 
even in the very area where the shooting had been do , cattle were still disappear . 
for less_than a dozen mile from the unplowed land of the dead man live another settler who had ignore the warning that his existence might be foreclose on - a blatant and defiant rustler name person . 
`` person be mighty crude about the way he take_in cattle '' his own hired_man , person , mention later . 
`` everyone know it , but he sort_of act like he did n't care who know it - even after them note come , even after he 'd hear about person , even after he 'd been shoot at a couple o ' time hisself '' ! 
on the morning of september 10 , 1895 , person and person rise at dawn and begin their day 's work . 
haying_time be close at_hand , and they need some strong branch to repair a hay rack . 
harness a team to a buckboard , they drive out to a willow lined creek about a half_mile off , then climb_down and begin chop . 
person had just start swing an ax at his second willow when the distant blast of a rifle sound . 
he look_around in surprise , then notice that person was clutch his chest . 
the hired_man run over to help his boss . 
`` my god , i 'm shoot '' ! 
person gasp . 
and he collapse and die instantly . 
person have no intention of search for the assassin . 
he heave the dead man onto the buckboard , yell and lash at the team and get_out of there fast . 
but he bring back the sheriff and several deputy , and to the lawman the entire affair seem a repetition of the person killing . 
a detailed scouring of the entire area reveal nothing beyond a ledge of rock that might have be the rifleman 's hiding_place . 
there were no track of either hoof or boot . 
not even an empty cartridge case could be find . 
once_again , person be the first and most likely suspect , and he was bring_in for questioning immediately . 
once_again , he shake his head , keep his face expressionless and his voice very calm , and have a strongly support alibi ready . 
later , ride in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional lady of cheyenne , he lay_claim to the killing with the vague insinuation he make . 
`` exterminate ' cow thief be just a business proposition with me '' , he 'd blandly announce . 
`` and i sort_of ' get a corner on the market '' . 
`` person '' , a friend ask him once , `` how_come you bushwhack them rustler ? 
they would n't o ' stand no chance with you in a plain , straight-out shoot-down '' . 
he have lots of friend , then as always . 
even as he become widely known_as a professional killer , nearly every cowboy and rancher in wyoming seem proud to call him a friend . 
no man 's name bring more cheer when it was announce in a rodeo . 
`` well '' , he explain , `` suppose you be a nester swing ' the long rope ? 
which would you be most scared of - a dry-gulchin ' or a shoot-down '' ? 
`` yeah , i can see that '' , the friend was force to agree . 
`` but , well , it just do n't seem sporting ' somehow '' ! 
`` sporting '' ' ! 
the tall sunburnt rustler hunter stare in amazement . 
`` sporting '' ' ! he echo again in soft wonder . 
`` i see a lot o ' thing in my time . 
i find a trooper once the apache had spread-eagle on an anthill , and another time we run_across some teamster they 'd catch , tie upside_down on their own wagon_wheel over little fire until their brain was explode right out o ' their skull . 
i hear o ' texas cattleman wrap_up ' a cow thief up in green hide and let ' the sun shrink ' em and squeeze him to death . 
but there 's one thing i never see or hear of , one thing i just do n't think there is , and that be a sporting ' way o ' kill ' a man '' ! 
after the first two murder , the warning note were rarely ignore . 
the lesson had been learn . 
the example be plain . 
when person 's brother-in-law , person , move_into the dead man 's home , the anonymous letter_writer take_a_chance no chances on person take_up where person had leave_off and waste no time on a first notice : 
if you do n't leave this country within 3 day , your life will be take the same as person 's was . 
this be the message find tack to the cabin door . 
person leave , within three day . 
all through location and location county , other man were do the same . 
house of settler who 'd treat the company herd as a natural_resource , free for the take , were sit empty , with weed grow high in their yard . 
the small half-heartedly tend field of man who 'd spend more time rustle cattle than farm were lie fallow . 
no cow thief could count_on a jury of his sympathetic peer to free him any_longer . 
jury , judge and executioner were ride the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere , at any time , to dispense an ancient brand of justice the man of the new west had believe long outdated . 
for three straight year , person patrol the southern wyoming pasture , and how_many man he kill after person and person ( if he kill person and person ) will never be known . 
it be possible , although highly doubtful , that he kill none at_all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claim every unsolved murder in the state . 
it be also possible , but equally doubtful , that he actually shoot down the hundred of man with which his legend credit him . 
for that legend was grow explosively , rumor was insist he receive a price of $ 600 a man . 
( the best evidence be that he receive a monthly wage of about $ 125 , very good money in an era when top hand work for $ 30 and found . ) 
rumor had_it he slip two small rock under each victim 's head as a sort of trademark . 
( a detailed search of old coroner 's report fail to substantiate this in the slightest . ) 
one thing be certain - his method be effective , so effective that after a time even the warning notice be often unnecessary . 
the mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field_glasses had been see ride that way be enough to frighten three rustle homesteader out of the location country in a single week . 
`` my reputation be my stock in trade '' , person mention more_than once . 
he evidently could n't foresee that it might be his downfall in_the_end . 
he had make himself the personification of the_devil to the homesteader . 
but to the cattleman who had been face bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboy who had been face with layoff a_few year earlier , he was become a vastly different type of legendary figure . 
such_as rancher as person and person and the person brother carry him on their book as a cowhand even while he was receive a much larger salary from party unknown . 
he make their spread his headquarters , and he help_out in their roundup . 
in the cow camp , person was regard_as a hero , as the same kind of champion he be when he enter and invariably win the local rodeo . 
the hand and their boss see him as a lone knight of the range , wage a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society that was threaten a beloved way_of_life . 
the wail , guitar strum minstrel of the cattle kingdom make_up song about him . 
by 1898 , rustling losses had been drive down to the low level ever see in wyoming . 
when several minute had pass and person had n't emerge from the livery_stable , person re-enter the hotel and face person across the counter . 
`` i have a little job for you , person . 
i be sure you won n't mind do me a small favor '' . 
person 's voice be oily , but person was n't fool . 
he moisten his lip uneasily . 
`` what is it you want me to do , person '' ? 
person shrug carelessly . 
`` it 's very simple . 
i just want you to take a message to person . 
tell her to come here to the hotel '' . 
vastly relieved , person nod and start toward the door . 
`` one thing , person '' , person say . 
`` you 're not to mention my name . 
tell her person want to see her '' . 
person pull_up short , and turn_around . 
`` i do n't know , person '' , he say haltingly , begin to get an inkling of person 's plan . 
`` it does n't seem quite right , tell her a thing like that . 
could n't i just '' - his voice trail off into silence . 
person continue to smile , but his eye be cold . 
he turn and look_around at the lobby as though see thing he had n't before notice . 
`` you know , person '' , he say thoughtfully . 
`` location 's location ought to have a fire_company . 
if someone were to drop a match in here , this place would go_up like a haystack '' . 
he start toward the stairway , then turn to add , `` tell her to come to person 's room , that person be in_trouble . 
tell her to hurry '' . 
`` yes sir '' . 
his face pale , person head for the street . 
person 's visit to the livery_stable had be merely a precaution in_case anyone should be watch . 
he pause only long enough to ascertain that person 's buckskin be still missing and that his own gray be all_right , then climb through a back window and drop to the ground outside . 
the fact that person 's horse had not been return to its stall could indicate that person 's information had be wrong , but person did n't interpret it this way . 
a man like person would want to have a ready means of escape in_case it was need . 
probably his horse would be close to where he was hide . 
from the back of the barn it be a simple matter to reach person 's house without use the street . 
person approach the place cautiously , and watch it several minute from the protection of a grove of tree . 
there was a light in person 's front_room , but drawn curtain prevent any view of the interior . 
person circle the house and locate a barn out back . 
he could hear horse move around inside , and nothing else . 
there was no lock on the door , only an iron hook which he unfasten . 
he open the door and go_in , pull it shut behind him . 
again he stand in the darkness listen , but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank floor . 
he move ahead carefully , his left_hand in_front of him , and come to a wooden partition . 
horse smell be very strong , and he could hear the crunch of grain being grind between strong jaw . 
he find a match in his pocket and light it . 
there were two horse in the barn , a swaybacked dun and person 's buckskin . 
person snuff_out the match . 
it be certain now that person be in the house , but also , presumably , be person . 
person want to get person alone , without interference from anyone , even as spineless a person as the store owner . 
he study the problem for a_few second and think_of a means by which it might be solve . 
reach across the side of the stall , he slap the buckskin on the rump . 
the startled animal let_out a terrified squeal and thrash around in the stall . 
as person had hope , the house door bang open . 
he slap the buckskin again and it kick wildly , its hoof rattle the side of the stall . 
person move_over beside the door and wait . 
presently he hear footstep cross the yard , and person 's smothered curse . 
the door swing open , and person say sourly , `` what the hell 's the_matter with you ? '' 
the horse continue to snort . 
person doubt that any animal belong to person would find much reassurance in its owner 's voice . 
person curse again , and enter the barn . 
a match flare , and he reach above his head to light a lantern which hang from a wire loop . 
as he cross to_the side of the stall , person draw his gun and click back the hammer . 
`` before you try anything '' , he say . 
`` remember what happen to person '' . 
person catch his breath in surprise . 
he start to reach for his gun , but apparently hammer it . 
`` that be the stuff '' , person say . 
`` just hold it that way '' . 
he reach_out to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt . 
`` you and i have a little talk to do , person . 
you won n't be need this '' . 
he move up and lift person 's pistol out of its holster . 
`` damn you , person '' - person was begin to recover from his initial shock . 
`` we ai n't get nothing to talk_about . 
if i do n't come_back in the house , person 's going_to '' - 
`` your trigger-happy brother be n't in the house . 
about now he 's probably have supper . 
that long ride the four of you take must 've give him a good appetite . 
now turn_around so i can see your face '' . 
person turn . 
there was raw fury in his eye , and the vein of his neck be swollen . 
`` you be about as dumb as they come , person . 
i do n't know what you be up_to , but when person '' - 
`` you can forget about person , too '' , person say . 
`` it 's person we 're going_to talk_about '' . 
`` person '' ? 
person stiffen . 
`` i do n't know nothin ' about him '' . 
`` no ? 
i suppose you do n't know anything about a piece of two-by-four , either ; one with blood all_over it , person 's blood '' . 
person 's finger put a_little more pressure on the trigger of his gun . 
`` so help me , person , i 'd like to kill you where you stand , but , before i do , i 'm going_to hear you admit kill him . 
now start talk . 
who tell you to do it ? 
be it person '' ? 
person was hold person 's gun in his left_hand . 
he draw_back his arm to slash the gun_barrel across person 's face , but did n't finish the motion . 
pistol whipping an unarmed man might come easy to someone like person , but person could n't bring_oneself to do it . 
apparently sense this , and realize that it give him an advantage , person become bold . 
`` have all the gun make you a big man , do n't it , person ? 
if we be both armed , you would n't talk so tough '' . 
`` no '' ? 
person reach_out and drop person 's pistol back into the holster . 
he retreat a step and holstered his own . 
`` all_right , crouch ; we be on even terms . 
now draw '' ! 
sweat bubble out on person 's swarthy face . 
the finger of his right_hand twist into a claw , but he did n't reach for the gun . 
person , angry enough to be a_little reckless , raise his hand shoulder high . 
`` does this make it any easy , coward '' ? 
`` i ai n't draw ' against you '' , person say thickly . 
`` i hear how you outdraw person . 
i be n't a gunslinger '' . 
`` no . 
you be the kind of bastard who sneak_up on a man from behind and hit him with a club . 
i just want to hear you say so '' . 
person stare at him without answer and let his hand fall to his side . 
he had find person 's weakness , or what to person be a weakness , and be smart enough to take_advantage of it . 
somewhere in the distance , a woman scream . 
person be too involved in his own problem to pay much attention . 
he had to make person talk , and he had to do it before person get curious and come to investigate . 
once_more he lift person 's gun from its holster , only this time he toss it into the stall with the frightened buckskin . 
he drop his own beside it . 
`` we 'll do it another way , then '' , he say harshly . 
person 's coarse feature twist in a surprised grin which was smash out of shape by person 's fist . 
with a roar of pain and fury person make his attack . 
person manage to duck beneath the man 's flailing fist , and drive home a solid left to person 's midsection . 
it was like hit a sack of salt . 
pain shoot up person 's arm clear to the shoulder , but person seem hardly aware that he had been hit . 
he slam into the wall , bounce back , and catch person with a roundhouse right which send him spin . 
an inch low and it would have knock him out . 
as it was , his vision blur and for a moment he be unable to move . 
when his eye begin to focus , he see person charge at him with a pitchfork . 
person twist to one side , and the tine of the fork bite into the floor . 
person waste a_few second try to yank them loose . 
it give person time to stagger to his foot . 
the tine break_off under person 's twisting , and he swing the handle in an attempt to knock_out person 's brain out . 
his aim be hurried ; so the pitchfork whistle over person 's head . 
by now person was see clearly again . 
he step inside person 's guard and land two blow to the big man 's belly , put everything he have behind them . 
they make person double_over . 
when his head come_down , person grab him by the hair and catapult him head first into the wall . 
the building shake , set the lantern to sway , and the buckskin to pitch again . 
even person 's old crowbait begin to snort , and from the house person yell , `` person ! 
what 's go_on out there '' ? 
person did n't seem too sure himself . 
he lurch drunkenly to his foot , lower his head , and take one step away from the wall . 
person catch him flush on the nose with a blow which start at the floor . 
person had have enough . 
blood gush from his nose , and he back_off as rapidly as he could , stumble over his own foot in his frantic haste to get_away from person 's fist . 
person be in almost as bad shape , but he would n't quit . 
he back person into a corner , grab a handful of the man 's shirtfront , and draw_back his right fist . 
`` tell me about person ! 
you kill him , did n't you '' ? 
`` it be person 's idea '' , person mumble , dab at his nose . 
`` he find_out about you and person talk . 
he want to show the town what happen to anyone who try to start trouble '' . 
`` you mean anyone who stand_up for his right '' , person say . 
he let_go_of the shirt , and person slump to the floor . 
turn his back , person cross to the stall , reach over to untie the buckskin 's halter rope , and wave his hand in the animal 's face . 
the buckskin bolt_out of the stall . 
person move_in and pick_up his gun . 
he shake loose straw out of the action , and place the gun in his holster . 
leave person 's where it lie , he leave the stall . 
`` get_up , person . 
we 're go someplace '' . 
person painfully get to his foot as someone rattle the door . 
`` who 's in there '' ? 
person call fearfully . 
person open the door , grab person by the shoulder , and pull him into the barn . 
`` you 're stay right here for_a_while . 
this dirty coward just admit kill person . 
i 'm going_to let him tell it to somebody else '' . 
he shove person toward the stall , and point his pistol at person . 
`` get_out of here . 
you 're come along peacefully , or i 'll put a bullet in your leg '' . 
person stumble through the door . 
person follow , reach behind him to shut the door and hook it . 
person would have little trouble get_out , but it might delay him a_few minute . 
`` where 're you take ' me '' ? 
person ask worriedly . 
`` we 're go to person 's house . 
maybe if the marshal hear this himself , it 'll make a difference . 
somebody in this town must still have some backbone '' . 
while no larger than location , this mining supply town have the appearance of be far busy and more prosperous . 
man crowd the street and freight rig and team were move about . 
although they were force to maintain a sharp watch , this activity enable them to ride in and rack their bronc without any particular attention being pay them . 
`` person 'll be holdin_'_forth in some bar if he 's here at_all '' , person declare , glance along the street as they stretch their leg . 
there be no less than six or seven saloon in location , not count the lower_class dive , all vie for the trade of celebrate miner and teamster . 
person only nod . 
`` take one side of the street , and i 'll take the other '' , he propose . 
`` if you spot person give a yell before you move_in '' . 
person 's assent be tight . 
`` you do the same . 
it 's all i ask , person '' . 
separate , they take different side of the main_drag and systematically comb the bar . 
person visit two place without result and his blood_pressure be down to zero . 
suddenly it seem to him insane that they might hope to locate person so casually , even were he to prove the thief . 
he tramp out of the location with his hope plummet , and head doggedly for the location , the last place of any consequence on this side of the street . 
the location be an elaborate establishment , build practically on stilt in_front , with long flight of wooden steps run up to the porch . 
behind its ornate facade the notorious dive cling like a bird 's nest to the rocky rib of the canyonside . 
person run up the steps quickly to the plank porch . 
the front window of the place be long and narrow , reach nearly to the floor and afford an unusually good view of the interior . 
head for the batwing , person glance perfunctorily through the near window , and suddenly dodge aside . 
nerve tight as a bowstring , he pause to gather his wit . 
against all expectation , person be inside , clearly enjoy himself to_the_hilt and already so tipsy that it seem unlikely he was bother to note anything or anyone about him . 
fierce anger surge through person . 
he fight_down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious puncher on_the_spot . 
reach the porch rail beyond view of the bar window , he feverishly scan the busy street below . 
person be nowhere in_sight . 
muffle an exclamation , person spring to the near steps and run_down . 
as luck have it , he had not go twenty foot in the street before person appear . 
`` what luck , person '' ? he say swiftly . 
person point upward . 
`` he be there '' , he get_out tersely , curb his rising excitement . 
hitch his cartridge_belt around , person glance upward briefly at the location and start that way with person at his side . 
climb the steps steadily , they reach the top and head for the door . 
person push_through first . 
force behind him momentarily , person follow at_once and halt two step inside . 
his eye widen . 
while five minute ago the place had present a scene of easy revelry , with person a prominent figure , it be now as somnolent and dull as the day before payday . 
person himself be nowhere to be see . 
a man knock_about the roulette_ball about idly in its track , and another doze at one of the card_table . 
two man murmur with their head together at the end of the bar , while the sleek headed bartender absently polish a glass . 
look the setup over , person start coolly for the rear of the place . 
`` where yuh go '' ' ? 
it be the barkeep . 
halt , person turn to survey him deliberately . 
he did not reply , go_on toward the back . 
less assured than the tall , wide shouldered man in_the_lead , person follow alertly , a hand on his gun butt . 
the bartender measure this situation with heavy eye and decide he want no part of it . 
he say no more . 
a hall open in back of the bar , run toward an ell . 
person move_into it . 
small room , probably for cards , open off on either side . 
all the door be open at this hour except one , and it was toward this that person make his way with person close at his shoulder . 
the door be locked . 
a single kick make it spring open , shudder . 
person see person stagger forward , a half filled bottle upraised as if to strike . 
person spring through to bat it nimbly aside . 
with a bellow person lunge at him . 
but he be more_than half drunk , and his faculty be dulled . 
person unleash a single powerful jab that send person reel wildly and crash down with a whining groan . 
he start to struggle up , heave desperately . 
person give him a brutal thrust that tumble him over flat on his stomach . 
kneel , person plant a sturdy knee in the small of his back , hold him pin . 
`` okay , person . 
i 've draw his fangs '' , he snap . 
`` go through his pocket , will you ? 
if we have to we 'll take_apart him apart and see what he 's make of '' ! 
comply methodically , person pull pocket after pocket inside_out without find a thing . 
person watch this with hunted eye , his desperate hope wane by the moment . 
person was grunt over the last empty pocket when person abruptly rise and lunge toward person 's hat , which had tumble half_a_dozen foot away when he first fell . 
person get it . 
straighten_up , his eye ablaze , he hold_out the battered stetson . 
`` look at this '' ! 
inside the crown , stuff behind the stained sweatband , could be see thin , crumpled wads of currency . 
person 's ingenious cache for his loot had been find . 
`` by golly , person ! 
you be right '' , person exclaim , tear the loose bill out of person 's hat . 
`` that_is , if we can be sure this be person 's money '' - 
person grunt . 
`` where else would he get it ? 
count what you 've get there , person . 
we can soon tell '' . 
person run_through the bill and name an amount it be highly unlikely any cowpuncher would come_by honestly . 
person nod . 
`` it be within a_hundred of what person have '' , he declare . 
`` we know person spend some - and person must have drop a_few dollar get that load on '' . 
hand the money over , person wipe his hand on his pant_leg as if rid himself of something unclean . 
his glance at person be disdainful . 
`` shall we get_out of here '' ? 
leave the cardroom , they move_back through the location the way they had come . 
glowering look meet them in the bar , but there be no attempt to halt them . 
pause in the outside_door to glance behind him , person look his unspoken warning and step_out . 
he and person clatter down the high steps to the street . 
neither speak till they reach their horse . 
person pause there , look_across at the young fellow . 
it 'll be a pleasure for you to return this money to person and tell him about it , person `` . 
he start to return it . 
to his faint surprise person hold_up his hand . 
`` not me '' , he rule decidedly . 
i 've have enough . 
it be you that track_down it down anyway , person `` , he pursue strictly . 
'' i 'll shove_along home `` . 
`` whatever you say '' . 
person swing into the saddle , yet still he delay , his brow pucker . 
`` you owe it to person to give her a chance to explain that she was defend you , really '' , he observe mildly . 
`` person was n't '' , retort person tartly . 
`` he 'll know when you tell him . 
but i want this to sink_in awhile . 
then maybe next time he won n't be so quick on the trigger '' . 
`` person had never pretend to give advice in such affairs . 
'' you be the doctor `` , he return with a smile . 
'' but i still think person 's an awful nice girl , person `` - 
`` you do n't have to tell me '' , flash person . 
give the other a dark look , he haul his bronc around and trot down off the street . 
person let him go , follow more leisurely . 
at the first restaurant he sensibly pull_up to go_in for his dinner , and as a consequence did not see person strike the open range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the swell for location . 
the truth be , the puncher be both bewildered and dismayed by his own mixed luck . 
`` person 's always glad to see me over there '' , he muse bleakly . 
yet had he not visit the girl at location he would never have be involve in this latest tangle . 
over and above that , however , be his growing suspicion of person 's part in recent event . 
`` person could n't have know about person 's money unless he was tell - and who else would have tell him '' ? he ask himself . 
`` it be the second time war_ax hands make a play for that money . 
how much of an accident could that be `` ? 
near home , he jerk to attention at the distant crack of a gun . 
in town no one pay much attention to an occasional shot ; but on the range gunfire have a meaning . 
haul_up , person listen carefully . 
two minute later it come again - a double explosion , follow by a third , sound more distant . 
as_near_as person could determine the shot come from the direction of the location ranch_house . 
he tighten_up in a twinkling . 
so_far_as he know , only his father could be there . 
what did it mean ? 
clap spur to the bronc he set_off at a sharp canter , with growing alarm . 
his first glimpse of the ranch_house across the brushy swell tell him nothing . 
still a quarter_mile away , the fresh clap of gun only serve to increase his speed . 
set a course straight for the house , he was cover ground fast when an angry bee buzz past close to his face . 
when it was follow by a second , whine even closer , person swerve sharply aside into a depression . 
he know now what he be up against . 
whoever be out there hide in the brushy cover was besiege the location house and , having spot his approach , be determined to drive him off before he could get_into the fight . 
curse himself for having ride out the last few day without a rifle in his saddle boot , person draw his colt and examine it briefly . 
if he wonder whether the attacker would allow him to pull away unmolested , he have his answer a moment later . 
`` over this way ! 
he ai n't go far '' ! a harsh cry float to him across the brush . 
a carbine crack more loudly , and a slug clip fragment from the brush off at one side . 
the would-be assassin had his position figure pretty close . 
dismount , person look about hastily . 
toward the west this depression lead toward a draw . 
lead his pony , he hurry that way , not remount till he be well below the level of the surrounding range . 
swing up then , and bend forward over the horn , he urge his mount down the meandering draw . 
he had not cover a_hundred yard before a gun crash from somewhere behind . 
he had been sight , and his attacker pump shot after shot . 
a shot or two go wild before person feel something tug at his foot . 
a slug had tear half of his stirrup guard away . 
a second twitch his shirtsleeve , and he feel a brief burn on his upper arm . 
another snarl close overhead . 
`` jumping_jerusalem ! 
let 's get_out of here '' ! 
at the first shot person had hurl his mount to the left toward the side of the winding draw . 
the long minute before he reach effective cover seem endless . 
sweeping a look around , he see that he be safe for_the_moment . 
he hear cry from behind him , but he could make_out no words . 
he dash madly for the next elbow turn in the draw , and make_it . 
recklessly hurl the bronc sidewise into an intersecting draw , he plunge forward with undiminished speed . 
gradually the wash climb upward , force him toward open range . 
yet he must chance it . 
he clamber out of the dwindling wash , the loose dirt fly behind him , and flash a look about . 
early in november the cloud lift enough to carry_out the assigned mission . 
and sweeney_squadron put its first mark on the combat record . 
every plane that could fly was send into the air . 
person take eight ship and go south across the location and along the north coast of location to location . 
anything the enemy fly or float be his target . 
person with eight was to patrol the location area , with his main task to get any kamikaze before they get to the ship . 
person himself take two flight , with person lead the second , to patrol and look_for target of opportunity around location on the east coast of location . 
each plane carry two five_hundred pound bomb . 
a weapons_carrier take person , person , person , person , and person and the others the two mile from the bivouac area to the strip . 
it be a rough long ride through the mud and pothole . 
no one have much to say . 
the sky glower down at them . 
there was a feeling that this mission would be cancel like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go_on forever . 
the truck drop them off at the various revetment spread through the jungle . 
person snatch person 's chute from him with a belligerent motion and almost run to the plane with_it . 
his face be dark as the sky above it as he stand on the wing and wait for his pilot . 
person climb into the cockpit feel as if he had never be in one before . 
but his hand and those of person move automatically adjust and arrange in the checkout procedure . 
`` i 've get her as neat as i can '' , person say , as he drop the strap of the seton harness over person 's shoulder . 
`` but this goddamn climate . 
it be for carabao not airplane '' . 
`` we 'll make_out . 
do n't you worry , chief '' , person reply , wonder if he himself believe it . 
`` yeah . 
see_you '' , person say as he jump off the wing . 
the expression be his trademark , his open_sesame to good_luck , and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return . 
at the prearranged time , person start the engine and taxi out . 
from the time the chock were pull until the plane be out_of_sight , he know person would keep his back to the strip . 
he wonder where the superstition had originate that it be bad_luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take_off on a combat_mission . 
yet long before the scheduled time for return , person would be watch for every speck in the sky . 
person rumble down the rough metal taxi_strip , and one_by_one the seven member of his flight fall_in behind him . 
the dark brown bomb hang under each wing look large and powerful . 
the pilot ' head look ridiculously small . 
the control_tower give him immediate takeoff permission , and the clean roar of the engine that take_off him off the rough strip speak well of the skill of person . 
person 's mission be the last to leave , and as he circle the ship off location he see the cloud were drop_down again . 
to the west , the dark green hills of location were lose in the cloud about halfway up their slope . 
underneath him the sea be a dark and muddied gray . 
water splash against his windshield as he lead the flight in and out of shower . 
the metal strip they had take_off from be coal-black against the green jungle around it . 
he possess the fighter pilot 's horror of bad_weather and instrument_flying , and he wonder , if the ceiling did drop , whether he and the other flight would be able to find their way back in_this unfamiliar territory . 
he shiver in the warm cockpit . 
the overcast be solid above him . 
as far as he could see there was no hole to climb through it . 
they would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separate location from location and hope that it did n't close_in before they return . 
location push the radio button on his throttle . 
`` person , let 's try to go under this stuff . 
stay in close and we 'll go up the valley '' . 
`` roger , person '' , person call back , and pull his four in and slightly above person . 
person take the formation wide around three a-26 attack bomber that be headed north over the location . 
he drop_down to five_hundred foot , swing a_little north of the city of location , and punch into the opening that show against the mountain . 
the valley be only a_few hundred yard wide with just_about room enough for a properly perform hundred-and-eighty degree turn . 
it be only a fifteen minute flight , but before it be through person feel himself develop a case of claustrophobia . 
the ceiling stay solid above them at about eight hundred foot , and at_times the sheer cliff seem about to close_in . 
if the other pilot be worried , they did not show it . 
the formation remain perfect . 
when the sea be visible ahead of them , the relief be as great as if the sun had come_out . 
he spread_out the flight out and lead them across a point of land and_then down the coast . 
although they draw light ground fire they see no sign of activity . 
once person think he had spot a tank and go_down to investigate while person cover him . 
`` somebody beat us to_it '' ! 
person say over the radio as he come_back up in formation . 
visibility continue to be limited , and person be never able to get above a_thousand foot . 
it be frustrating . 
his earphone be constantly full of the sound of enemy contact make by other flight . 
he think once that he identify the somewhat hysterical voice of person claim a kill . 
but person 's area remain as placid as a florida dawn . 
finally , as time begin to run_out , he head into location and glide-bomb a group of house that intelligence had think might contain japanese supplies . 
the low cloud make bombing difficult . 
there was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run . 
the accuracy be deplorable . 
one of person 's bomb hang_up , and he be mile from the target before he could get_rid_of it . 
only one of the flight score a direct hit and the rest blow_up jungle . 
with their load of bomb gone , the plane move swiftly and easily . 
person go_up tight against the ceiling and lead them back to their pass to home . 
mercifully , it be still open . 
like a man make a deep dive , person take_a_breath full breath and plunge back into the valley . 
he be about to make a gas check on his flight when person 's voice break_in : `` person ! 
three bogy . 
twelve o'clock level '' . 
person 's eye flick up from his instrument_panel . 
he see them , speck against the gray , but close_in fast . 
they be headed straight for each other on a collision course . 
friend or enemy ? 
the same old question . 
and only a_few second to answer it . 
`` zeros '' ! 
person say excitedly , and hopefully . 
and_then he think person might be right . 
his mind flick through the mental_picture he have from the hours of aircraft_identification . 
he narrow_down the shape down to two : either a zero or a group type aircraft . 
if it be the enemy , tactically his position be correct . 
japanese aircraft be strong on maneuverability , american on speed and firepower . 
his present maximum altitude , up against the overcast , give him the opportunity to exploit his advantage . 
but it also make him conspicuous to the enemy , if it be the enemy , and he had n't been spot already . 
but the close_in aircraft show no sign of deviate from their original course . 
in second , person make his decision . 
he push the radio button . 
`` person , hit_the_deck . 
lots of throttle . 
person , you take_on the one on the left . 
i 'll take_on the middle . 
person , the one on the right . 
if & & & if they be jap . 
let 's make sure first '' . 
person have the stick forward and the throttle up before he hear the two `` rogers '' . 
the plane , light with most of the gas burn out , respond beautifully . 
person 's airspeed indicator be over 350 when he level_off just above the tree . 
the opposing aircraft continue to come_on . 
they appear to be the enemy . 
person wish the air_corps had continue to camouflage plane . 
there was , of_course , no way for the other plane to get_by them . 
it be a box . 
but they could turn and escape to the east . 
person push the radio button again . 
`` person , drop_back your second element back . 
if any of us miss , they can pick_up the pieces . 
now let 's make sure they be jap '' . 
even as he say it , person know they had find the enemy . 
the shape be unmistakable and the rising sun were show_up , slightly bright pinpoint in the gray gloom . 
person slap his hand across the switch that turn_on the gun and gun camera and gun sight . 
the circle with the dot in the center show_up yellow on the reflector glass in_front of him . 
his hand shake . 
`` arm your gun , person '' . 
`` they be jap . 
they be jap '' , come a high-pitched voice . 
`` person to person . 
one pass only . 
no turn . 
you 'll bust_your_ass in_this canyon . 
that be an order '' . 
he move the flight over against one wall . 
it give them all a chance to make a high-speed climb turn attack and a breakaway that would not take them into the overcast or force a tight turn recovery . 
if the turn be too tight , a barrel_roll would bring_out them out . 
a hell of an altitude for a barrel_roll , but it could be do . 
person slam his throttle to the firewall and ram up the rpm , and the engine respond as if it had been wait . 
the clearly identifiable enemy continue on as if no one else be around . 
`` they have n't see us '' , person yell to himself over the engine noise . 
`` they have n't see us '' . 
he hit the radio button . 
`` now , person , now . 
let 's take ' em home '' . 
he haul back on the stick and feel his cheek sag . 
out of the corner of his eye , he watch his wingman move out a_bit and shoot_up with him . 
perfect , he think . 
with the rapid rate of closure , the approach from below , the side , and ahead , there would be only a moment when damage could be do . 
just like shoot at a duck while perform a half_gainer from a diving_board . 
he tighten his turn . 
his nose up . 
it was going_to be dangerous . 
eight aircraft in_this small box . 
please , dear god , make my pilot good , he pray . 
he take a lead on the enemy , use a distance of five of the radius in his circular sight and_then add another . 
the enemy did not veer . 
it did not seem possible that they had n't been spot . 
blind fool . 
now ! 
person 's finger close on the stick trigger . 
the plane rumble and slow . 
six red line etch their way into the gray and vanish . 
as if draw by a wire the enemy fly into them . 
person tighten his turn until the plane shudder . 
luck be with him . 
his burst hold for a second on the engine section of the plane . 
the jap 's propeller fly off in piece . 
a large piece of engine cowling vanish . 
it was all person have time to see . 
his maneuvering for the shot had place him near the overcast , almost inverted and head_up into the cloud . 
his speed was drop rapidly . 
if he spin out now , he would join his opponent on the ground . 
wingman , stay clear , he pray . 
he push stick and rudder and enter the overcast on his back . 
he fight the panic of vertigo . 
he have no idea which be up and which be down . 
he hold the control where they had be . 
sweat pop_out over him and he feel the slick between his palm and the stick grip . 
his airspeed drop until he think he would spin out . 
over the rattling of fender , humming of tire and chattering of gear there be a charming melody of whisper and tiny giggle . 
cool air move slowly through the open or smashed out side window hint of blooming roadside vegetation , and occasionally a faint fragrance of perfume swirl from the back seat . 
`` person '' , my driver suddenly exclaim with something so definite , so final in his tone i once_more repeat the absurdity , muster all my latent power of hypocrisy to sound convinced . 
we were come to an intersection , turn right , chuff to a stop . 
force to realize that this be the end of a very short line i scan a road marker and discover what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old person : location , new_mexico . 
`` gracias . 
adios '' , i say , exhaust my spanish vocabulary on my host and exchange one of a scarcely tap store of smile with my host 's daughter . 
i wave with discretion and moderation to the vague golden face fade through rise dust and the distortion of the back window glass . 
then i see the father 's head slightly turn ; gauche rainbow shape replace the poignant oval of gold . 
auto whiz past . 
white shirt and conservatively cravated driver stare conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my supplicate and accusing gaze . 
suddenly a treble auto horn tootley-toot-tootled , and , thumb hopefully , i see emergent in windshield flash : red lip , streaming silk of blonde hair and - ah , trembling confusion of hope , apprehension , despair - the leering face of old person . 
`` mor-ee-air-teeeee '' , he shriek , his white tooth grossly counterpoint those of the glittering blonde . 
over the rapidly diminishing outline of a jump_seat pile high with luggage person 's black brush_cut be just discernible , near , or enviably near that spot where - hidden - more delicately textured , most beautifully tinted hair must still be stream back in cool , oh cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca flower and engine fumes . 
damn his luck . 
i would have forgo my romantic chance rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty and - well , at_least i would n't have shout back a taunt . 
still nurse anger i listlessly thumb a car that was slowly approach , its prewar chrome nearly blind me . 
it was stop . 
just as i straighten_up with my duffel_bag , i hear : `` person , meet person '' . 
the voice be that of person , tail gunner off another crew . 
squeeze a look between person 's fat jowl and the car frame a handsome and still dark-haired lady inquire `` y_'_all_drahve '' ? 
i nod . 
`` onleh_one_thiihng '' , person continue . 
`` ahm go north t ' join mah husband in location , an_y ' all maht prefer the southern route . 
but person has already say it didn_make_no diffrunce_t '_hi-im '' . 
i say that it did n't make any difference to me either , as far as i know . 
how far i know will shortly become apparent . 
let me pass_over the trip to location with something of the same speed which make person `` wonder if the wahtahm speed_limit '' ( 35 mph . ) `` be still in effect '' . 
i let_up on the accelerator , only to gradually reach again the 60 mph which would , i hope , overhaul person and the blonde , and as there were car whose driver apparently have something more important to catch than had i , person settle_down to practice on person the kittenish wile she would need when make her duty call on colonel and mrs somebody in location . 
when person ejaculate `` howsabout my buying us all a nice cold coca_cola , ma'am '' ? 
person smilingly decline and begin suddenly to go_on about her son , who be `` only a_little younger than you boy '' . 
person never would have believe she have a son that age . 
person think person be a `` sweet boy t ' lie lahk thet '' , but her person was get_to be a man , there was no get_around it . 
`` just before he leave foh his academy we wuh have daiquiri on the veranda , person an ah , an person say ' may ah have one too ' ? 
just_as polite an - an confident , an ah say ' of_course you can n't ' , but he say ' whah not , you ah have one ' ? 
an ah coudn answer him an so ah say ' all_right , ah guess , an his father did not utter one word an after person be gone , the major laugh an tell me thet he an the boy had been have an occasional drink together f ' over a year , only an occasional one , but just the same it be behind mah back , an ah doa not think thet be nice at_all , d ' you '' ? 
`` no , i do n't '' , person say . 
`` i be a good baptist , and drinking & & & '' . 
person very kindly let me drive through sante_fe to a road which would , she say , lead us to location and_then location and `` eventually '' out of new_mexico . 
how lightly her `` eventually '' passed_into_the_crannies where i was store dialect material for some vaguely dreamed opus , and how the word would echo . 
and reecho . 
hardly had person drive off when a rusty pickup truck , father or grandfather of senor `` person 's '' ford sedan , come screech to a dust swirling stop , and a brown face appear , its nose threaten by shard of_what had once be the side window . 
`` get_in , buddy . 
get_in '' . 
the straight , black hair flop in a vigorous nod , the slender nose plunge toward glass tooth and draw safely back . 
person unwire the right-hand door , whose window be , like the left one , merely loosely taped fragment of glass , and person wad himself into a narrow seat make still more narrow by three case of beer . 
`` in back , buddy '' , the driver say to me . 
quickly but carefully lower my duffel_bag over the low side rack , i step_on the running_board ; it flop down , spring back up and gouge my shin . 
the truck was hurtle forward . 
i seize the rack and make a western style flying mount just_in_time , one of my knee mercifully land on my duffel_bag - and merely wreck my camera , i was to discover later - my other knee land on the slivery truck floor_board and - but this be no medical_report . 
i be again in motion and at a speed which belie the truck 's similarity to person 's ford turtle . 
maybe i would beat old person to siberia after_all . 
whatever satisfaction that might offer . 
something pull my leg . 
i draw_back , draw_back my foot for a kick . 
but it be only person reach around the wire chicken fencing , which half cover the truck cab 's glassless rear_window . 
the way his red rubbery lip were stretch across his pearly little tooth i though he was only have a little joke , but , no , he want me to bend down from the roar of wind so he could roar something into my ear . 
`` wanna beer '' ? 
`` hell , yes '' , i roar back between dusty lip . 
did i want a beer ? 
did an anteater want ant ? 
`` bueno , amigo . 
gracias '' , i holler , my first long swallow fill me with confidence and immediately double the size of my spanish vocabulary . 
at_once my ear were drown by a flow of what i take_to_be spanish , but - the driver 's white tooth flash at me , the road wildly veer beyond his glistening hair , beyond his gesticulating bottle - it could have be the pure oxford_english i was half hear ; i would n't have know the difference . 
person was try to grab the wheel , though the swerve of the truck was throw him away from_it . 
white tooth suddenly vanish , the driver slam the side of his bottle against person 's ear . 
we be off the road , gleaming barbed_wire pull taut . 
i duck just as the first strand break somewhere down the line and come whip over the sideboard . 
we be in a field , in a tight , screeching turn . 
prairie_dog were pop_up and pop down . 
when i fall on my back , i see a vulture hover . 
just as i get to my knee , there was again the sound of the fence stretch , and i have time only to start take my kneeling posture seriously . 
this time no wire come whip into the truck . 
we be back on the road . 
i regain my squatting position behind the truck cab 's rear_window . 
person 's left_hand was press against the side of his head , red cheek whiten beneath his finger . 
`` tee-wah '' , the driver cackle , his black eye glitter behind dull silver chicken fencing . 
`` that be tee-wah i was talk . 
you think i be a mexican , did n't you , buddy '' ? 
i nod . 
`` hell , that 's all_right , buddy '' , the indian ( i now guess ) say . 
`` drink your beer '' . 
miraculously , the bottle be still in my hand , foam still geyser over my ( luckily ) waterproof watch . 
no sooner had i start drink than the driver start zigzag the truck . 
the beer foam furiously . 
i drink furiously . 
a long time . 
empty the bottle . 
tooth again flash back at me , the driver release a deluge of spanish in which `` amigo '' appear every_so_often like an island in the stormy wave of surrounding sound . 
i bob my head each time it appear . 
suddenly the spanish become an english in which only one word emerge with clarity and precision , `` son_of_a_bitch '' , sometimes hyphenated by vicious jab of a beer_bottle into person 's quivering rib . 
a big car was approach , its chrome tooth grinning . 
beyond it the gray road stretch a long , long way . 
the car be just about to us , its driver 's fat , solemn face intent on the road ahead , on business , on a family in location - on anything but an old pickup truck in which two human_being desperately need rescue . 
i toss the bottle . 
high , so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the car 's steel roof . 
too high . 
on unoccupied roadway the bottle shatter into a small amber flash . 
`` aye-yah-ah-ah '' ! 
the indian was again raise his bottle , but to my astonished relief - probably only a fraction of person 's - the bottle this time go to the indian 's lip . 
another car was come , a tiny , dark shape on a far hill . 
i start look on the splintery truck_bed for a piece of board , a dirt clod - anything i could throw and with better aim than i had throw the beer_bottle . 
we were slow . 
in the ditch sand be white and soft looking , only an occasional pebble discernible , faintly gleaming . 
but person could n't quickly unwire the truck door , and if i escape , he might suffer . 
the car was approach fast . 
on the truck_bed there was nothing small than a piece of rusty machinery ; with more time i could have loosen a small burr or cotter_pin - 
suddenly and not a second too soon i think_of the coin in my pocket . 
there was no time to pick_out a penny ; i get a coin between my thumb and forefinger , lean my elbow in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck cab and flip my little missile . 
there was a blur just under my focus of vision , a crash ; the car 's far windshield panel turn_into a silver web with a dark hole in_the center . 
i hear the screech of brakes behind me , an insane burst of laughter beneath me . 
look_back i see a gray-haired man get_out of his halted car and try to read our license_number . 
`` person '' . 
person 's fat hand , another bottle were protrude from the truck cab , and that self proclaimed baptist teetotaler , have a bottle at his own lip . 
two car come over a crest , their chrome and glass flash . 
the indian 's arm whip sidewise - there was a flash of amber and froth , the crash of the bottle shatter against the side of the first car . 
brakes shriek behind us . 
i see person 's bottle snatch from his hand , see it go in a swirl of foam just behind the second car . 
this time there was no sound of brakes but the shrieking of woman . 
i look_back at pale oval frame in the elongated oval of the car 's rear_window . 
`` drink , you son_of_a_bitch '' ! 
i quickly turn_around and begin to drink . 
but the indian was jab another bottle toward person . 
i guide her to the divan , turn_off the tv , face her . 
she sit quietly , stare at me from the wide eye . 
and what eye they be . 
big and dark , a melting , golden brown . 
eye like hot honey , eye that sizzled . 
plus flawless skin , smooth brow and cheek , lip that look as if you could get a shock from them . 
it be a disturbingly familiar face , too , but i could n't remember where we had meet . 
i say , `` do we know each other , miss '' ? 
`` no , i remember read about you in the paper and that you live here , and when it happen all i could think_of was - '' . 
this time she stop the rush of words herself . 
`` i 'm sorry . 
shall i go_on '' ? 
she smile . 
it was her first smile . 
but worth wait for . 
`` sure '' . 
i say . 
`` but one word at_a_time , o._k . '' ? 
she was still hug the stained coat around her , so i say , `` relax , let me take your things . 
would you like a drink , or coffee '' ? 
`` no , thanks '' . 
she stand_up , pull the coat from her shoulder and start to slide it off , then let_out a high-pitched scream and i let_out a low-pitched , wobbling sound like a muffler blow_out . 
she was wear nothing beneath the coat . 
she jerk the coat back on and squeeze it around her again , but not soon_enough . 
there had be a good second or two during which my muffler had been blow_out , and now i be certain i 'd see her somewhere before . 
`` i forget '' ! she yelp . 
`` oh , do forgive me . 
i 'm sorry '' ! 
`` i forgive - '' . 
`` that 's what start all the trouble in_the_first_place . 
oh , dear , i 'm all unstrung '' . 
`` you and me both , dear . 
have n't we & & & have n't i see you & & & . 
i mean , surely we 've - '' . 
`` you may have see me on tv '' , she say . 
`` i 've do several filmed commercial for - '' . 
then it hit me . 
`` zing '' ! 
i cry . 
`` why , yes . 
and you recognize me '' ? 
`` yes , indeed . 
in_fact , i was watch you on_that little seventeen inch screen when you ring my bell . 
man , you ring - it be in_color , too , miss , and & & & miss ? 
what 's your name , anyway ? 
ah , you be splendid '' . 
i sit by her on the divan . 
`` splendid . 
in a waterfall and all that '' . 
`` that 's the last one we do . 
that be a fun one '' . 
`` i 'll bet . 
it be fun for me , all_right . 
i do n't mean to pry , but do they hide the swimsuit with the bubble ? 
i mean : is advertising honest ? 
`` it depend_on who do it . 
i never wear anything at_all . 
it would n't - would n't seem fair , somehow '' . 
`` i could n't agree with you more '' . 
`` i really do have something important to tell you , person . 
about the murder '' . 
`` murder ? 
oh , yeah '' , i say . 
`` tell me about the murder '' . 
she tell me . 
zing be the creation of two man , person and person , partner in group ! 
, inc. . 
they 'd peddle the soap virtually alone , and without much success , until about a year ago , when - with the addition of `` sx-21 '' to their secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising_campaign - sale had soar practically into orbit . 
their product had been endorse by good_housekeeping , the a._m._a. , and the veterinary_journal , among other repository of high wisdom , and before much longer if you did n't have a cake of their soap in the john , even your best friend would think you did n't bathe . 
my lovely caller - person be her name - had previously do three filmed commercial for zing , and this_evening , the fourth , a super production , had been film at the home of person . 
the water in person 's big swimming_pool had been cover with a blanket of thick , foamy soapsuds - fashion , of_course , from zing - person had dive from the board into the pool , then swirl and cavort in her luxurious `` bath '' while camera roll . 
the finished - and drastically cut - product would begin with a hazy longshot of person enter the suds , then burst above the pool 's surface clothe in layer of lavender lather , and i have a hunch this item was going_to sell tons and tons of soap ; even to clean man and boy . 
person go_on , `` when we 'd finish , person - person - ask me to stay a_little longer . 
he want a_few still for magazine ad , he say . 
everybody leave and i stay in the pool , then person come_back alone and leap into the pool too . 
and he did n't have_on any clothes on '' . 
`` he did n't '' ! 
`` yes , he did n't . 
did , i mean '' . 
she pause . 
`` did leap into the pool , and did n't have_on anything on . 
anyway , it be evident what he have_in_mind '' . 
`` you get_away , did n't you '' ? 
`` yes . 
he catch_up_with me once and grab me , but i be all covered with zing - it 's very slippery , you know '' . 
`` i did n't know . 
i would n't have the stuff in the house . 
but i 'm pleased to hear - '' . 
`` so i just scoot out of his clutches . 
i swim like_mad , get_out of the pool , grab my robe , and run to the car . 
the key be still in it , and i be mile away before i remember that my clothes and purse and everything be still in the little cabana where i 'd change '' . 
she 'd drive_around for_a_while , person say , then , think person would have calm_down by that time , she 'd go_back to his home on location , park in_front , and walk toward the pool . 
while several yard from_it , still concealed by the shrubbery , she 'd see two man on her left at the pool 's edge . 
she go_on : 
`` a man was hold onto person , hold him up . 
maybe person be only unconscious , but right then i think he must be dead . 
the man shove him into the water , then run past the cabana . 
there 's a walk there that go out to location . 
i be so scared , well , i just run to my car and come here '' . 
`` you know who the other man be '' ? 
`` no , i never did see his face . 
i did n't get_a_look a good look at him at_all , his back be to me , and i be so scared . 
it be just somebody in a man 's suit . 
but i 'm sure the other one be person '' . 
what person want me to do was go_to person 's house and `` do whatever detective do '' , and get her clothes - and handbag contain her identification . 
she realize i 'd have_to notify the police , but fervently hope i could avoid mention her name . 
her impact in the zing commercial had lead to her being consider for an excellent part in an upcoming tv series , underwater_western_eye , a documentary type show to be sponsor by oatnut_grits . 
but if person get involved in murder or salacious scandal , the role would probably go to the sponsor 's wife , person . 
or at_least not to person . 
`` and i so want the part '' , she say . 
`` the commercial have just be for money , there has n't be any real incentive for me to do them , but in underwater_western_eye i 'd have a chance to act . 
i could show what i can do '' . 
as_far_as i be concerned , she had already and had dandily show what she could do . 
but i promise person i would mention her name , if at_all , only as a last_resort . 
seem much relieved , she smile one of those worth wait for smile , and i smile all_the_way into the bedroom . 
there i get my group special and shoulder harness , slip_on my coat on , and go_back into the front_room . 
person squirm a_little on the divan . 
`` i 'm start to itch '' , she say . 
`` itch '' ? 
`` yes , i 'm still all covered with that soap . 
i be loaded with suds when i run_away , and i have n't have a chance to wash it off . 
mmmm , it sure itch '' . 
`` you might as_well wait here while i 'm gone , so you can use my shower if you 'd like '' . 
`` oh , i 'd love to '' . 
i show her the shower and tub , and she say , smile , `` if you really do n't mind , i think i 'll get clean in the shower , then soak for a_few minute in your tub . 
that always relax me . 
does n't it you '' ? 
`` only when i do it '' . 
i shake my head . 
one of my virtue or vice be a sort_of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound_effect and glorious living color . 
`` soak as_long_as you want , person . 
it 'll probably be at_least an hour or two before i can check back with you . 
so you 'll have everything all to yourself , doggone '' . 
i look at my watch . 
ten after nine . 
time to go , i suppose . 
`` well , good-bye '' , i say . 
`` good-bye . 
you 'd had_better hurry '' . 
`` oh , you can count_on that '' . 
she smile slightly . 
softly . 
warmly . 
`` do n't hurry too_much . 
i 'll be soak for at_least half an hour '' . 
that be all she say . 
but suddenly those hot honey eye seem to have everything but swarm of bee in them . 
however , when there 's a job to be do , i 'm a monstrosity of grim determination , i like to think . 
i spin about and clatter through the front_room to the door . 
as i go_out , i could hear water pour in the shower . 
hot water . 
she would n't be take a cold shower . 
hell , she could n't . 
location be only two or three mile from the group , and it take me less_than five minute to get there . 
but the scene be not the quiet , calm scene i 'd expect . 
four car were park at the curb , and two of them be police radio car . 
light blaze in the big house and surrounding grounds . 
i follow a shrubbery lined gravel path alongside the house to the pool . 
two uniformed officer , a_couple_of plainclothesman i know , and two other man stand on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left . 
at the pool 's far end be the little cabana person had mention , and on the water 's surface float scattered lavender patch of limp look lather . 
a_few yard beyond the group of man , a man 's nude body lie face down on a patch of thick green dichondra . 
person , one of the plainclothesman , spot me and say , `` hi , person '' , and walk toward me . 
`` how 'd you hear about this one '' ? 
i grin , but ignore the question . 
he did n't push it ; person work out of location and we 'd be friend for year . 
he fill_in me in . 
a call to the police had been place from here a_couple_of minute after nine p.m. , and the first police_car had arrive two or three minute after_that - 10 minute ago now . 
present at the scene - in_addition to the dead man , who be indeed person - had be person 's partner person , and person , an advertising_agency executive who handle the zing account . 
neither of them , i understand , had be present at the filming session earlier . 
`` what were they do here '' ? 
i ask person . 
`` they were supposed to meet person at nine p.m. for a conference concern the ad_campaign for their soap , a new angle base on this sx-21 stuff '' . 
`` yeah , i 've hear more about sx-21 than space exploration lately . 
what be the gunk '' ? 
`` how would i know ? 
it 's a secret . 
that be the new advertising angle - something about a group policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient . 
actually , only two man know what the formula be , person and '' - he stop and look at person 's body . 
i say , `` o._k. , so now only person know . 
how 's it strike you , foul or fair '' ? 
`` ca n't say yet . 
deputy coroner say it look like he suck_in a big pile of those thick suds and strangle on ' em . 
the pm might show he drown instead , but that 's what the once-over-lightly give us . 
accident , murder , suicide - take your pick '' . 
`` i 'll pick murder . 
anything else '' ? 
`` according to person , he arrive here a couple minute before nine and spot person in the water , get a hooked pole from the pool equipment locker and start haul him out . 
they be west of the sabine , but_only_god_knew_where . 
for three day , their stolid oxen had plod up a blazing valley as flat and featureless as a dead sea . 
molten glare singe their eyelid an angry crimson ; suffocating air sap their strength and strain their nerves to snap ; dust choke their throat and lie like acid in their lung . 
and the valley stretch_out endlessly out ahead , scorched and baked and writhing in its heat , until it vanish into the throb wall of fiery orange brown haze . 
person extend his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the nose of the oxen . 
`` hoa-whup '' ! he command from his raw throat , and feel the pain of movement in his cracked , black burned lip . 
he remove his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulet through the dust film upon his gaunt face . 
he spit . 
the dust thick saliva come from his mouth like balled cotton . 
he move back to the wheel and stand there blow , grasp the top of a spoke to still the trembling of his played_out limb . 
the burning air dry his sweat soaked clothes in salt edged patch . 
he clear his throat and wet his lip . 
as cheerfully as possible , he say , `` well , i guess we could all do with a little drink '' . 
he unlash the dipper and draw water from a barrel . 
they could no_longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat_bag that cool it by evaporation . 
the water be warm and stale and have a brackish taste . 
but it be water . 
thank_the_lord , they still have water ! 
he cleanse his mouth with a small quantity . 
he took a long but carefully controlled draught . 
he replenish the dipper and hand it to his young wife ride the hurricane_deck . 
she take it grudgingly , her dark eye baleful as they meet his . 
she drink and push back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and wipe her face . 
she set the dipper on the edge of the deck , leave it for him to stretch after it while she look_on scornfully . 
`` what happen when there be no more water '' ? she ask smolderingly . 
she be like charcoal , he think - dark , opaque , explosive . 
her thick hair be the color and texture of charcoal . 
her temper spark like charcoal when it first light_up . 
and all_the_time , she have the heat of hatred in her , like charcoal that is burn on its underside , but not visibly . 
a ripple run through the muscle of his jaw , but he keep control upon his voice . 
`` there must be some water under there '' . 
he tilt his homely face toward the dry bed of the river . 
`` we can get it if we dig '' , he say patiently . 
`` and add fever to our trouble '' ? she scoff . 
`` or do you want to see if i can stand fever , too '' ? 
`` we can boil it '' , he say . 
her chin sharpen . 
`` we be lost and burn_up already '' , she bite_out tensely . 
`` the tire are rattle on the wheel now . 
they 'll roll off in another day . 
there be no valley like this on your map . 
you do n't even know where we be headed . 
`` person '' , he say as gently as he could , `` we be still headed west . 
somewhere , we 'll hit a trail '' . 
`` somewhere ! '' she repeat . 
`` maybe in_time to make a cross and dig our grave '' . 
his wide mouth compress . 
in_a_way , he could n't blame her . 
he had pick_out this pathless trail , instead of the common one , in a moment of romantic fancy , to give them privacy on their honeymoon . 
it had be a mistake , but anything would have be a mistake , as it turn_out . 
it be n't the roughness and crudity and discomfort of the trip that had frighten her . 
she had hate the whole idea before they start . 
actually , she had hate him before she ever see him . 
it had been five day too late before he learn that she 'd go_through the wedding_ceremony in a semitrance of laudanum , administer by her mother . 
the bitterness of their wedding_night still rip within him like an open wound . 
she had jump away from his shy touch like a cat confront by a sidewinder . 
he had leave her inviolate , think familiarity would gentle her in_time . 
but each mile westward , she had hate him the deeply . 
he stare at the dipper , turn it over_and_over in his wide , calloused hand . 
`` i suppose '' , he mutter , `` i can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to your folk , once we find a settlement '' . 
`` do n't try to be noble '' ! 
her laugh be hard . 
`` they would n't have sell me in_the_first_place if there 'd be food enough to go_around '' . 
he wince . 
`` person , they did n't sell you '' , he say miserably . 
`` they know i be a good sharecrop_farmer back in location , but out west be a chance to build a real farm of_our_own . 
they think it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be think any better than the next except for just what be inside of them . 
without money or property , what would you have have at baton_rouge '' ? 
`` i might have starve , but at_least i would n't be fry to a crisp and soaked with dirt '' ! 
he darken under his heavy burn . 
his blue eye seek the shimmering sea of haze ahead . 
to his puzzlement , there suddenly be no haze . 
the valley lie clear , and open to the eye , right up to the sharp-limbed line of gaunt , scoured hills that form the horizon twenty mile ahead . 
then he notice the cloud race upon them - heavy , ominous , leaden cloud that form even as they slice over the crest of the surrounding hills . 
he had never see cloud like them before , but he have the primitive feel of danger that grip a man before a hurricane in location . 
he holler hoarsely , `` hang_on '' ! and goad the oxen as he yell . 
he wanted to turn them , put the wagon against the storm . 
too late , he realize that in turning , he had wheel them onto a patch of sandy ground , instead of atop a grade or ridge . 
he swing up over the wheel . 
`` you had_better get inside '' , he warn her . 
but she sit on in stubborn silence . 
the cloud bulge downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel . 
frozen , they stare at it whirl down the valley , gouge and spit_out boulder and chunk of earth like a starving hound_dog crack marrowbone . 
the six ton conestoga_wagon begin to whip and shake . 
their world turn black . 
it was fill with dust and wind and sound and violence . 
the heavens open , pelt them with hail the size of walnut . 
and_then come the water - not rain , but solid sheet that sluice down like water slop from a bucket . 
wall of water rush down the slope and fill the hollow like the crest of flash_flood . 
through the splash of the rise water , they could hear the roar of the river as it rage through its canyon , gnash big chunk out of the bank . 
the jetting , frothing surface of the river reach the level of the runoff . 
the dangerous current upon the prairie cease , but the water stand and keep_on rise . 
they cringe under sodden cover , listen to the wave slop against the bottom . 
the cloudburst cut_off abruptly . 
they were engulf by the weird silence , break only by the low , angry murmur of the river . 
then the darkness thin , and there be light again , and_then bright sunlight . 
beaten with fear and sound and wet and chill , they crawl to the hurricane_deck and look out haggardly at a world of water that reach clear to the surrounding hills . 
the water_level be high than their hub . 
only the heavy bone of the oxen keep them anchor . 
there was no real sign of the river now , just a roiling , oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy water that reach everywhere . 
clump of brush ride down the ribbon . 
now_and_then , the glistening side of a half swamped object show as it sweep past . 
the girl crawl out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine , hug her shoulder and still tremble . 
her face be pale but set and her dark eye smolder with blame for ben . 
out of compulsion to say something cheery , ben_prime blurt , `` well , we be lucky to be on soft ground when the first floodhead hit . 
at_least , the wheel dig in . 
the soaking will put life back in the wagon , too '' . 
his wife did n't give a sign she 'd hear . 
she was watch a tree ride wildly down that roiling current . 
somebody was ride the tree . 
it race closer and they could see a woman with white hair , sit astride an upright branch . 
she did not call_out . 
but as the tree pass , she lift an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell . 
they watch the tree until it twist sharply on a bend . 
it spear up_into_the_air , then sink back , the up jutting branch turn slowly . 
the pale blob of the woman disappear . 
`` there be the one who 's lucky '' ! the girl murmur harshly . 
ben 's eye strain with the bitter hurt , his homely face slashed with gray and crimson . 
then he take_off his wet boot and drop_down into the water to talk with the beast , need their comfort more than they need his . 
it be nearly sundown and he go to the back of the wagon , half swim his way , for he be not a tall man . 
he let_down the tailgate and was knock_over by the sluice of water . 
he sputtered back to his foot and scramble madly to pull his bag of seed_grain forward . 
they be already swollen to burst . 
of all their worldly_belongings , next_to the oxen and his gun , the seed_grain had be the most treasured . 
it was spoil now for seed , and it would sour and mold in three day if they fail to find a place and fuel to dry it . 
the oxen might as_well enjoy it . 
he examine the watermark on the iron tire when the animal were finish . 
the water lie muddy but placid , without a ripple of movement against the wheel ; there was not a match width of damp mark to show they were recede . 
he doubt if a man could wade as far as the desolate , dry hills that rim the valley . 
a terrible , numbing sense of futility sweep_over him . 
he grip the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat . 
then he notice that the dry wood of the wheel had swell . 
the spoke be tight again , the iron tire grip onto the wheel as if of one piece . 
hope surged within him . 
he swing toward the front to give the news to hettie , then stop , bar from her by the vehemence of her blame and hate . 
still , he feel better . 
a tight wagon mean so much . 
he got a small fire start and put_on bacon and coffee . 
he pour the water off the sourdough and off the flour , salvage the chunky , watery mess for biscuit of a sort . 
their jam and jelly had not suffer . 
he find a jar of preserved tomato and one of eggs that they had mean to save . 
now he break_open them open , hope a good meal might lessen this depression crush hettie . 
his long nose wiggle at the smell of frizzle bacon and heating java , but the fire be low , and he want to waste no time . 
he furl the slashed side of the canvas tarpaulin , leave the rib and wagon open . 
he look thoughtfully at his wife 's trunk , hold her meager treasure . 
he say hesitantly , `` hettie , i do n't figure your things get wet too_much . 
that be a good trunk . 
if you want to get them air '' . 
she say without turn her head , `` after that rain beat in atop the dust , there be n't a thing that won n't be streaked '' . 
he draw a long breath and open the trunk and hang out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon rib . 
person say nothing . 
`` is there any word you would like to offer in your own defense '' ? 
person shake his head . 
person say , `` answer me properly , person '' . 
person be_quiet for a moment long , then he say , `` there be nothing i want to say , captain '' . 
`` very_well '' . 
person walk away . 
naval procedure , he think , have its moment of grim humor . 
person had cold-bloodedly plan the murder of his captain , yet it seem in_order to chide him for a lapse of proper address . 
during the morning hour , it become clear that the arrest of person was have no sobering effect upon the man of the somers . 
those name in the greek paper were manufacture reason to steal aft under pretence of some call of duty , so_as to be near person , watch an opportunity to communicate with him . 
hostile glance were flash at both person and person . 
the two meet in the captain 's cabin . 
`` what be the next step , captain '' ? 
`` more arrest , i fear '' . 
in your opinion , who be this person on the ' certain ' list `` ? 
`` person , of_course . 
he be the old and most experienced of the lot . 
he see the danger , not the glory of being identify as a mutineer . 
somehow he talk_into person into let him use another name '' . 
there be a tap at the door and person enter with the word that person wish to see the captain . 
`` have him come_in '' . 
person , breathless and wild-eyed , bring the chilling news that the handspike , heaver and holystone had been mysteriously remove from their customary place . 
`` and also , sir , two article which were consider souvenir now must be regard in another light entirely . 
an african knife and battle-ax are at this moment be sharpen by person and person . 
person was overhear to say that he would like to get the knife into person 's possession and that '' - 
`` where did you gather all this information , person ? 
who report to you the disappearance of handspike and heaver and who '' - 
he was interrupt by a crash from the deck and spring toward the ladder , with person and person behind him . 
a glance reveal that the main topgallant_mast had been carry_away . 
the aimless mill_about of_what had be a well trained , well organized crew strike person with horror . 
he bellow order and watch the alert response of some of his man and watch , too , the way a dozen or more turn their head questioningly toward the shackled figure as though for further instruction . 
person hasten to person 's side . 
`` person violently jerk the weather royal_brace with full intention to carry_away the mast . 
i see him myself and it was do after consultation with person . 
i swear it , sir '' . 
and it was clear that person be not mistaken , for both person and person take no step toward aid in the sending up of the new topgallant_mast till person had give the signal to obey . 
then , with disappointment evident upon their face , they move to the work . 
person guess that they had plan confusion and turmoil , think it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed . 
their strategy be sound enough and , he reason , had been defeat only by person 's unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originate . 
when the mast was raise , person give the order for person and person to be place under arrest , and now three figure in irons sprawl upon the open deck and terror stalk the somers . 
person 's potential follower be openly sullen and morose , miss muster without excuse , express in ominous tone their displeasure at the prisoner being keep in irons , communicate with the three by glance and signal . 
one of the missing handspike come_out of its hiding_place after person had been insolently disobey by person . 
person had report the man to person and an hour later , with back turn , had been attack by person , brandish the weapon . 
person , shackled and snarl , was throw with the other prisoner and was soon join by person , person and person . 
not a man on the brig , loyal or villainous , could be unaffected by the sight of seven man involve in the crime of mutiny . 
in the tiny cabin , person meet with person , person and person to speak and to listen . 
three day had pass since person 's arrest and each day had bring new danger , new fear . 
person say , `` it require an omniscient eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely_on . 
to have the greek paper be not the great help that at first flush it seem . 
from action aboard , it be easy to guess that person 's boast of twenty staunch follower be a modest estimate '' . 
`` well '' , person venture , `` why do n't we hold an investigation with questioning and '' - 
`` that would be worse than useless '' , person break_in . 
`` there be not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoner . 
besides , suppose we hold a court of inquiry , then what ? 
then we have inform a large_number of our crew that when they reach the united_states , they will be punish but that in the meanwhile , they may run loose and are expect to perform their job in_good_order . 
person , does this sound like a truly workable plan to you ? 
do you not think these man might choose the black_flag here_and_now '' ? 
person say , `` of_course they would . 
they are about to do so at any moment as_it_is . 
all that is need be for one man to feel self-confident enough to take the lead . 
as_soon_as that one man is appoint by himself or the others or by a signal from person , we are going_to be rush . 
we are going_to be rush and murder '' . 
`` that is extravagant language , person . 
we are not going_to be rush and murder '' , person say . 
`` we are going_to bring the somers into new_york harbor safe and sound '' . 
`` of_course , i agree with the captain '' , person say thoughtfully , `` but the conspiracy be ferocious and desperate . 
the instinct of discipline has been lose . 
anything be possible when anarchy have the upper_hand '' . 
he pause , then add , `` everything on a ship be a weapon . 
implement of wood and iron be available for close and hasty combat no_matter where a man stand . 
and we be positive of so few and suspicious of so many '' . 
`` we ourselves must stand_sentinel '' . 
person say . 
`` under_arms day and night , watch and watch about . 
those of us present , the person brother , person and the other midshipman now have the responsibility of the somers . 
a great_deal of labor we have as_well , for we be too uncertain of where trust may be place '' . 
and when he be alone again in the cabin , person lower his head into his arm and weep , for he know full well what must be do , what in_the_end would be do . 
with all his heart he had love the navy and now he must act in accordance with the navy 's implacable law . 
and when he did , when he give to his ship that protection necessary to preserve her honor , he know he would lose forever the navy to which he had dedicate his soul . 
where had he fail ? 
how had he fail ? 
he who had try so hard , who had yearn so passionately to be a great officer . 
it come_to him as he weep there aboard the somers that it be as foolish to strive for greatness as to seek to storm the gate of heaven . 
it was give or it was not give . 
one do one 's best and if fortune smiled , there be a reward . 
one do one 's best and if fortune frowned , an eighteen year old boy with murder in his heart sail aboard one 's ship . 
and person sob like a girl for the dream he had have , and he feel no shame . 
god_knew his tear be his to shed if he so desire , for it had not been with an egotist 's rage for fame that he had hold precious his naval career . 
another field had give him fame enough to satisfy any egotist . 
it was for love that he had serve the navy . 
to have someday that love return be what he had live for . 
now the hope be gone . 
yes , he would bring the somers safely into new_york harbor but at a price . 
dear_god , at what a price . 
and after a while , he dry his tear and walk the deck as a captain should with assurance and dignity . 
stern faced , he inspect the prisoner , satisfy himself that they be clean , well feed and comfortable within_reason . 
the prisoner avert their eye but not before he had glimpse hatred and anger . 
only person , the giant boatswain , be mild-mannered and respectful . 
he say , `` captain , may i speak , please ? 
captain , i be innocent of any plot against you or the ship '' . 
`` be you , person '' ? 
`` yes , sir . 
before god i swear i be innocent . 
i know nothing of any plot , if there be such a thing '' . 
`` you be the only man aboard who can be in doubt '' . 
`` i cannot speak_for others , sir , but i be innocent '' . 
he lean closer to person , squint up at him from the deck . 
`` surely , captain , you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything '' . 
`` no , person , i did not find your name . 
you be careful about that '' . 
now person , seem with effort to shake himself from lethargy , speak . 
he say , `` person is tell you the truth . 
he be innocent '' . 
person shift his gaze to person . 
the calmness and detachment of his tone suggest unawareness of how implicit be his own guilt in the words he had used to defend person . 
person know person too well to think him naive or thick-skulled . 
and in a sudden wave of painful clarity , person recognize a kinship with person . 
here be another human who understand the stupidity of quarrel with the inevitable . 
there be good_fortune and there be bad and person , in handcuffs and ankle irons , know it to be a truth . 
he expect nothing for himself but that which naturally follow those marked for misfortune . 
the red haired captain , tower above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authority , was shock to find himself look with_sympathy upon person . 
this tragic lad had forge his own shackle . 
but he could not have done so , could not have find the way , had fortune favor him . 
and because fortune had favor neither the prisoner nor the red haired captain , they would be each other 's undoing . 
`` person , if there be guilt , if you do not deny your own , how is it possible for person to be innocent ? 
he be your constant companion '' . 
the hazel eye meet person 's . 
`` i tell you he be innocent '' . 
`` and do you think there be a reason why i should accept your word '' ? 
`` yes . 
i have nothing to gain by defend person '' . 
`` nothing to lose , either , person '' . 
`` that 's true '' , person agree and withdraw himself from the conversation . 
his eye go_back to contemplation of the sea . 
`` i be innocent , captain '' , person say again . 
`` before god , captain , i be innocent '' . 
and though it be logical that a man who could plot mass_murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth , still it be difficult to understand why person speak_for only for person . 
the boatswain be as guilty as any . 
no action of his could be interpret in his favor and four midshipman , prior to their know the significance of the greek paper , had see it in person 's hand while person whisper explanation . 
`` i think '' , person had tell person , `` that person was teach him geometry '' . 
it was fantastic to turn from the seven man in shackle to the wardroom , where a class of apprentice await him . 
this be a training_ship and the training would continue , but there be an element of frightful absurdity here which person recognize . 
some of these apprentice be , in physical strength , already man and doubtless a percentage of them be person 's follower . 
`` and i 'll take you with me '' . 
the two of them against the world . 
that had be how she imagine it . 
for when he begin to talk and dream all at_the_same_time , make his plan as he go , she had begin dream too . 
but now the dream be over . 
the big waking_up had happen . 
`` what did i imagine '' ? she think . 
`` did i see him about to swing low in a chariot ? 
or maybe pole up the south fork of the location brave the waste dump in it ? 
maybe i see him on a barge with a gang of ethiopian pole it '' . 
and i 'll take you with me . 
he had take her all_right . 
wednesday night after youth fellowship . 
out of the church and into his big car , it tool over the road with him drive and the headlight sweep the pike ahead and after he hit college , his expansiveness , the quaint little pine board tourist_court , cabin really , with a cute naked light_bulb in the ceiling ( unfrosted and naked as a streetlight , like the one on the corner where you used_to play when you be a kid , where you watch the bat swoop in after the bug , watch in between your bout at hopscotch ) , a room complete with moth ping the light and the few casual cockroach cruise the wall , an insect group with feeler wave . 
and the bed that sag in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many time before and the wall fine and thin for overhear talk in the next room when person go_out for ice , the sound come through the wall like something on the other side of the curtain , so you know they hear you when they be quiet and while you lie wonder what they had hear you listen . 
and person would be in memphis today for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody know he would , just like everybody know all_along . 
like person and the mayor up there grip the microphone and person back in his office yank out tooth , like they all know he would . 
just like the balloon would go_up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a leak or blow_up to_hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen . 
or you could hope the parachute would n't open just so you could say you see it not open , not because you mean any harm to person in his suit of red underwear , but mainly because you be tired_of be an old_maid - a thing which cannot admit when it think it might be pregnant , but must stand the dizzy feeling all alone and go_on like everything be all_right instead of be able to say to somebody in a normal voice : `` i think i be pregnant '' . 
you could wish that . 
or you could wish your daddy would really do it - kill person like he say when you all_the_time , all_along , could feel the nerve drain out of him like air out of a punctured tire when you be on a muddy road alone and it is rain and at night . 
so you sit in the car and listen to the air run_out and listen to the rain and see the mud in_front_of the headlight , wait for you , for your new spectator_pump , wait for you to squat by yourself out there in your tight skirt , cry and afraid and try to get that damned son_of_a_bitch tire off , because that be be an old_maid too , if you happen to drive a car , it be change the tire yourself in the night , and in the mud and the rain , hate to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help . 
and every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who think after he has rape you he have to beat your brain out with a tire_tool so you won n't tell , a combination like ham_and_eggs , rape her and kill her , and that be be an old_maid too . 
it be not have his baby nestle warm and fat against your breast and it be not have somebody that really gives_a_damn whether some tramp crack your skull . 
and most of all it be not have the only man you could love , whether he drive a bread truck or deliver the mail or check the berry crate down at the shed , or own seventeen oil_well and six diamond mine , for if you be anybody what he be or do make no difference if he be the one . 
he can even be a mild voiced little town guy with big town idea and level gray eye and a heart even person could n't figure_out , how it is unlock . 
and he can be on_the_way to memphis , your person can , and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and love him and want him even if it mean you want him - really want him - dead . 
because if you can n't then nobody else can either , nobody else can have him . 
for you do n't share him , not even with god . 
if it is love , you do n't . 
and i 'll take you with me . 
even if that be all the promise he ever give or ever will give , the giving of it once be enough and you believe it then and you will always believe it , even when it be finally the only thing in the world you have left to believe , and the whole world is tell you that one be a lie . 
even when he be on_the_way to memphis you will still have the promise rest inside you like a gift , and it be he inside of you . 
and in_a_way the promise work_out true , for whether he want you or not , you go with him in your heart . 
you feel him every mile far away . 
you feel where he be and what he see , and at night you feel when he be asleep or with the other woman , the one that never could love him the way you do , the one who get him because she did n't particularly give_a_damn whether she get him or did n't . 
and you know you will always wonder all_of your life whether it was because you want him so bad that you did n't get him , and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think_of that other guy , the chump who beg you to marry him , the one with the plastered hair and the car he can n't afford and the too shiny shoe . 
you think : `` did he feel that way about me '' ? 
it come_to you that probably he did feel that way to let you use him like you did when you could n't have person ; that he must have since he be there like the radio for you to turn_on or snap off when you get tired_of him , that other guy . 
it dawn on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table from you , he be a man , and that because person was make you miserable , you were pass it down to him , to person 's substitute , that other guy . 
and you wonder if that be why the little man lose his job and his car and stay drunk about a year before he straighten_out and move to st._louis , where he got to be a big unhappy success . 
you wonder if he look at his wife now and think_of you . 
you wonder about the christmas_card with no name on it , and it come_to you that maybe it would have be better to have make somebody else happy if you could n't be happy yourself , to give somebody else the one they want - to give them you . 
`` damn the world '' , she think . 
she look out at the corn field , the great green deep acre of it rolled_out like the sea in the field beyond the whitewashed fence border the grounds . 
the mayor envision factory there . 
home and factory and school and a big wide federal highway , instead of peaceful corn to rest your eye on while you try to rest your heart , while you try not to look at the balloon and the bandstand and the uniform and the flash of the instrument . 
the band be impatient , but they be the only ones . 
the others , the ones in the stands , be spellbound , for hear the mayor be for them like listen to a symphony be for sophisticated folk in new_york_city . 
it be like be in the concert_hall in the afternoon and hear the piano virtuoso rehearse . 
he be good and they know that what he was do for them he would do all_over the united_states someday . 
so they stay quiet and hang not on what he say but on how he say it , not listen exactly , but rather , feel . 
if a man be good , if he was going_to be governor , you feel it and you want him to go_on forever . 
you be sorry when he finish talk because while he be up there you be someone else and the world be something else too . 
it be a place full of courage and hope and you be part of it . 
you laugh and then your chest swell and you feel you could cry for a little bit , and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and the goose_bumps ripple along your arm . 
he hit the theme about die to defend your country , and you be ready to do it right then , without a second_thought . 
while he talk you would n't trade be a location farmer for be anything else in the whole damned world , no_matter if it had n't , in six week , rain enough to wet_a_rat 's_ass . 
she glance at the man nod beside her , a man with weather crack furrow into his lean cheek , with powdery pale eye reflect all the drought he had see , reflect the sky and the drought which must follow now in august - yes , with eye predict the drought and here it was only june , only festival time again and thought of person would not leave her . 
`` i should have stay at the store '' , she think . 
back at the group with the other old_maid , back there she be the young clerk and she be thirty-four , which make her young enough to resent the usual ideal working condition , like the unventilated toilet with the door you have to hold shut while you sit_down . 
there was no lock because person did n't allow a lock . 
a lock on the toilet would encourage malingering and primping . 
the toilet had n't have a sincere scrubbing in years and there were thing written on the wall of the little boxed_in place because you could n't keep the public out - entirely . 
she could not count the time person had rap on the door , just a_couple_of bang that shake the whole damned closet and might , someday , break_away the pipe connection from the wall . 
the two little bang mean that he was get impatient to have a crowd of customer wait on and that if he have to he would jerk open the door and drag out , by the opposite doorhandle which she would be clutch , whichever-the-hell clerk it be who think she could waste so_much store time on the pot . 
and the hours be six-thirty in the morning until eleven at night on saturday and during sale , and there were no chair and you could n't smoke and the cooling was overhead fan and there was no porter or janitor . 
among us , we three handle quite a few small commission , from spot drawing for advertising_agency uptown to magazine work and quick lettering job . 
each of us have his own specialty besides . 
person do wonderful complicated pen-and-ink drawing like something out of a medieval miniature : hundred of delicate detail cram into an eight by ten sheet and look as if they had be done under a jeweler's_glass . 
he also draw precise crisp spot , which he sell to various literary and artistic journal , the new_yorker , for_instance , or esquire . 
i do book_jacket and cover for paperback reprint : naked girl huddle in corner of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway , dare the cop to take him , be the guy in shirtsleeves clutch a revolver . 
the book could be the_brothers_karamazov , but it would still have the same jacket illustration . 
i remember once i do a jacket for group ; the book be a fine historical novel about person , , and i do a week of research to get the detail just_right : the fifteenth century armor , furnishings , clothes . 
i even ferret_out the material from which shield were make - linden wood cover with leather - so i 'd get the light reflection accurate . 
person , the art_editor , take_a_look one look at my finished sketch and say , `` nothing_doing , person . 
in the first place , it be static ; in the second place , it does n't look authentic ; and in the third place , it would cost a fortune to reproduce in_the_first_place - you 've get six color there include gold '' . 
i say , `` person , it be as authentic as careful research can make it '' . 
he say , `` that may be , but it be n't authentic the way reader think . 
they know from their research into television and the movie that knight in the middle_ages have beautiful flowing haircut like person , and only the villain have beard . 
and girl could n't have dress like that - it be n't transparent enough '' . 
in_the_end , i do the same old picture , the naked girl and the guy in the doorway , only i put a person shirt on the guy , give him a sword instead of a pistol , and paint in furniture from the still of a costume movie . 
person be as happy_as_a_clam . 
`` that be authenticity '' , he say . 
as for person , he actually sell painting . 
we all paint in our spare_time , and we had all start as easel painter with scholarship , but he be the only one of us who make any regular money at it . 
not much ; he sell perhaps three or four a year , and usually all to person or her friend . 
he have style , a real inner vision of his very own . 
it be strange stuff - it remind me of the picture of a child , but a child who has never play with other kid and has live all its life with adult . 
there was the freshness of color , the freedom of perception , the lack of self-consciousness , but with a twist that make the form leap from the page and smack you in the eye . 
we used to kid him by say he only paint that way because he be so nearsighted . 
it may have be true for all i know , because his glasses be like the bottom of milk bottle , but it did n't prevent the painting from be exciting . 
he also have , at_times , an uncanny absentminded air like a sleepwalker ; he would look right through you while you were talk to him , and if you say , `` for_christ's_sake , person , you 've get prussian_blue all_over your shirt '' , he would smile , and nod , and an hour later the paint would be all_over his pants as_well . 
person think_of him as her discovery , and she pay two to three hundred dollar for a painting . 
it be all gravy , and person did n't need much to live_on ; none of us did . 
we share the expense of the studio , and we all live within walking distance of it , in cheap lodgings of one kind or another . 
attend the life_class be my idea - or rather , person 's idea , but i be ripe for it , and the other two would n't have go if i had n't talk_into them into it . 
i want to paint again . 
i had n't do a serious picture in almost a year . 
it be n't just the pressure of work , although that be the excuse i often use , even to myself . 
it be the kind of work i was do , the quality of the ambition it awake in me , that keep_from me from painting . 
i kept say , `` if i could just build_up a reputation for myself , make some real money , get_to be well_known as an illustrator - like person , for_instance - then i could take_time_off some time_off and paint '' . 
person be a kind of goal i set myself ; i had admire him long before i talk to him . 
it look to me as though he have everything an artist could want , joy in his work , standing in the profession , a large and steady income . 
the night we first meet , at one of person 's giant party , he was wear a brown cashmere jacket with silver button and a soft pink viyella shirt ; instead of a necktie he wear a leather bolo draw through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure jade . 
this set his tone : richness of texture and color , and another kind of richness as_well , for his clothing and decoration would have pay the brush-off 's rent for a year . 
he be fifteen year older than i - forty four - but full of spring and sparkle . 
he did n't look_like what i think_of as an old_man , and his lively and erudite speech make him seem even young . 
he be one of the most prominent magazine illustrator in america ; you see one of his painting on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazine every_month . 
group had include him in its `` modern american artist '' series and had photograph him at his studio in the east_sixties ; the corner of it you could see in the photograph look as though it ought to have person in it paint the royalty of spain . 
i have a long talk with him . 
we go_into person 's library , which have low bookshelf all along the wall , and above them a person portrait , a person twelve foot long , and a gorgeous person with a yellow background , that look_like an inscription from a martian tomb . 
the fireplace have tile make for person by picasso himself . 
like certain expensive restaurant , just sit there give you the illusion of be wealthy yourself . 
in the course of our talk , person mention that he spend part of each_week study . 
`` by yourself '' ? 
i ask . 
`` no , i take class with different people '' , he say . 
`` i do n't think i 've reach the point , yet , where i can say i know everything i ought to know about the craft . 
besides , it be important to the way a painter think that he should move in a certain atmosphere , an atmosphere in which he may absorb the idea of other master , as person go_to italy to meet person and person '' . 
he make a circle with his thumb and finger . 
`` painting be n't this big , you know . 
it does n't embrace only the artist , alone before his easel . 
it be as large as all_of art , interdependent , varied , multitudinous '' . 
he throw his arm wide , his face shining . 
`` the artist be like a fragment of a mosaic - no , he be more_than that , a virtuoso performer in some vast philharmonic . 
one_of_these_days , i 'm going to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that 's being paint these day , from extreme abstract_expressionism to extreme photorealism , and_then you 'll be able to see at a glance how much artist have in_common with each other . 
the eye be all , inward or outward . 
ah , what a title for the exhibition : the eye be all '' ! 
`` what do you study '' ? 
i ask . 
i was fascinate ; just listen to him made me feel intelligent . 
`` i 'm study anatomy with person '' , he reply . 
`` maybe you know him . 
he teach at the group '' . 
i nod . 
i had study with person ten year before , during the scholarship year the location give me , along with the five_hundred dollar prize for my painting of bum on location . 
person and i had not love each other . 
`` i 'm also study enamel with person '' , he go_on , `` and twice a week i go_to a life_class teach by person '' . 
`` person '' ? 
i say . 
`` my god , be he still alive ? 
he must be a_million years old . 
i go_to a retrospective of his work when i be eighteen , and i think he be a contemporary of person 's '' . 
`` not quite '' . 
person laugh . 
`` he be about sixty , now . 
still paint , still a kind of modern impressionist , beautiful canvas of mountain and farm . 
he even make the city look_like one of thoreau 's hangout . 
i 've always admire him , and when i hear he was take a_few pupil , i go to him and join his class '' . 
`` yes , it sound great '' , i say , `` but suppose you do n't think_of yourself as an impressionist painter '' ? 
`` you 're miss the point '' , he say . 
`` he have the magical eye . 
and he be a great man . 
contact with him be stimulating . 
and that be the trouble with so many artist today . 
they lack stimulation . 
they sit alone in their room and try to paint , and only succeed in isolate themselves still farther from life . 
that be one of the reason art is become a useless occupation . 
in the middle_ages , in the renaissance , right up_to the early nineteenth century , the painter be a giant in the world . 
he be an artisan , a man who study his trade and develop his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a woodcarver do . 
he fill a real need , show society what it look_like , turn it inside_out , portray its war and its leaders , its ugliness and its beauty , reflect its profound religious impulse . 
he be a propagandist - they be n't afraid of the word , then - satirist , nature lover , philosopher , scientist , what you will , a member of every party and of no party . 
but look_at us today ! 
we hold safe little job illustrate toothpaste ad or the salacious incident in trivial novel , and most_of our easel painting be nothing but pick the fluff out of the navel so it can be contemplate in greater purity . 
a bunch of amateur dervish ! 
what we need is to get_back to the group , to learning and apprenticeship , to the cafe and the school '' . 
he could certainly talk . 
the upshot of the evening be that i get the address of person 's studio - or rather , of the studio in which he give his class , for he did n't work there himself - and join the life_class , which meet every tuesday and thursday from ten to twelve in the morning . 
it be an awkward hour , but i did n't have to punch_in any time_clock , and it only mean that sometimes i had to stay a_couple_of hour later at the drawing_board to finish_up a job . 
after a short time , both person and person join the class with me so they would n't feel lonely , and we used_to hang a sign on the door of the brush-off read `` out to work '' . 
it be mostly for the benefit of the mailman , because hardly anybody else ever visit us . 
in_a_way , person be right . 
`` stimulate '' be the word for it . 
i do n't know that it be always as rewarding as i had expect it to be . 
partly , it was because person himself be n't what i anticipate . 
i had come prepare to worship at the foot of this classic , and he turn_out to be a rather bitter old_man who smell of dead cigar . 
no , that be n't quite fair . 
actually , there be a_lot of force in him , which be why i keep_on in that class instead of quit after a week . 
`` i have a rather small place of my own . 
a nice bachelor apartment in a place called the location '' . 
`` uhhu '' , she say , hardly listen as she study her left eyelid . 
`` and_then i have another place far downtown i use as a studio '' . 
`` uhhu '' . 
`` i 'm not a man who have many close intimate friend , person '' , he say , want her to know all about him . 
`` oh , i 'd drink with newspaper people . 
i think i be what you might call a convivial man , and yet it be when i be alone in my studio , do my work , that i really feel alive . 
but i think a man need at_least one intimate friend to communicate with '' . 
pause , he wait for her to turn , to ask a question . 
she show no interest at_all in the life he had lead back home , and it hurt him a_little . 
`` well , what about you , person '' ? 
`` me '' ? she ask , turn slowly . 
`` what about me '' ? 
`` did you make friend easily '' ? 
`` umm , uhhu '' . 
`` somehow i imagine that as you grow_up you be alone a_lot . 
how about it '' ? 
`` i guess so '' , she say take a kleenex from her purse . 
when she had wipe some of the lipstick from her mouth , she stare solemnly at her image in the mirror . 
`` are your people still alive '' ? he ask , try to touch a part of her life person had n't discuss ; so he could have something of her for himself . 
`` you talk so well , person '' , he go_on . 
`` you seem to have read so much , you have a natural gift for words '' , he add , try to flatter her vanity . 
`` you must have be good at history at school . 
where did you go_to school '' ? 
`` what be this '' ? she ask , turn suddenly . 
`` do n't you know all about me by this time ? 
my name 's person . 
this be my town . 
i sleep_with you . 
you know something more about me every_day , do n't you ? 
would you be happy if i make_up some story about my life , tell you some lie ? 
why are you try to worry me '' ? 
`` i 'm not try to worry you '' . 
`` well , all_right then '' . 
the cleansing tissue she had been use had been fall on the floor , and he get_up and pick_up one , then another , hope she would notice what he was do . 
at home he had be a clean orderly man , and now he had_to hide his annoyance . 
was she just naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance ? 
he wonder . 
would he have_to clean_up after her every_day , clean the kitchen , the bathroom , and get_down on his knee and scrub the kitchen floor , then hang_up her dress , pick_up her stocking , make the bed while she lie_around ? 
he straighten_up , ready to vent his exasperation , then grow afraid . 
if he dwell on the indignity he suffer he would lose all respect for her , and without the respect he might lose his view of her , too . 
`` what 's the_matter '' ? she ask suddenly . 
`` nothing . 
nothing at_all '' , he say quietly . 
`` let 's go_out '' . 
`` are those the only shoe you have , person '' ? 
`` what 's the_matter with them '' ? 
`` the heavy thick sole . 
look at them '' . 
`` they 're an expensive english shoe for walk_around a_lot . 
i like them '' . 
`` person , no one around here wear such heavy sole . 
ca n't you get another pair '' ? 
`` maybe i could '' , he say , surprise that she could turn from herself and notice anything about him . 
`` i 'll get an elegant pair of thin soled italian shoe tomorrow , person '' . 
`` and i do n't know why you want to go_on wear that outfit '' , she say , make a face . 
`` what 's the_matter with it '' ? 
he had put_on the gray jacket and the dark gray slacks and the fawn colored shirt he had wear that first night in rome when he had encounter her on the street . 
`` oh , person . 
you look_like a tweedy englishman . 
ca n't you wear something else and look a_little more as though you belong '' ? 
`` i do n't mind at_all '' , he say , delight with her attention . 
change his clothes , he put_on his dark-blue flannel suit , and lay away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be put it aside for_good . 
but it be a hopeful sign , he tell himself . 
she no_longer want anything about him to remind her of the circumstance of their meeting that first night in location . 
that day they loaf around , just get the feel of the city . 
they look at the ruin of the old roman wall on the low location , then they go_to the location . 
she had some amusing scandal about the person in the old day . 
then they take a taxi to location . 
`` there 's a church you should see '' , she say . 
and when they stand by the fountain in the piazza look at santa_maria he had_to keep a straight_face , not let_on he had be there with person . 
he let her tell him all about the church . 
then they have dinner . 
all evening she be eloquent and pleased with herself . 
when they get home at midnight she was tire_out . 
and in the morning when he wake_up at ten the church_bell were ring . 
he had never hear so many bell , and as he lie there listen , he think_of her scold him for his remark when he had look up at the obelisk and the church at the top of the location . 
it be a good thing that she cling to her religion , he think . 
she might like to take him to st._peter 's . 
`` person , wake_up '' , he say shake her . 
`` it be ten o'clock . 
are n't you go_out to mass ? 
you could take me to st._peter 's '' . 
`` uhhu '' , she mutter . 
`` come_on , you 'll be late '' . 
`` i think i 'll sleep_in this morning '' , she say drowsily , and as she snuggle against him , he wonder if she ever go_to church . 
why did he want her to go_to church ? 
he wonder . 
probably because it be a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security . 
it would be good for her . 
it be too_bad he have no feeling himself for church . 
not his poor mother 's fault . 
she would have be better_off if she had stick_to her bible . 
as for himself , he just did n't have the temperament for it . 
from the time he had be at college he had achieve a certain tranquility and composure by accept the fact that there be certain thing he could never know . 
then he think_of those old_testament figure on the ceiling of the sistine_chapel . 
just figure out of a tribal folklore . 
could he honestly believe it would be good for person to have those old prophet grip her imagination now ? 
be a woman though , she would take only what she need from church . 
it be too_bad he be n't a catholic himself . 
or a protestant , or one of those amusing dogmatic atheist , or a strict orthodox communist . 
what be the_matter with him that they all weary him ? 
it be the times , he be sure . 
all the ideology change from day to day , right under his eye , so how could a man look_to any one of them for an enlargement of his freedom ? 
it be all_too wearying . 
look somewhere else . 
but where ? 
just_the_same , he think , ponder over it , it would be a good thing for a girl like person if she get_up and go_to church . 
a half-hour later he get_up her up to go_out for breakfast so the person , hear them hurry down the stairs , would think they were go_to a late mass . 
it seem to him that if the person feel sure of them , could place them , it would help him to feel more sure of himself with person . 
`` since we 're have coffee with them this afternoon '' , he say , `` i think i 'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every_day to clean for us '' . 
and he wait for her to say , `` oh , no , i can do it , person . 
there 's so little to do '' . 
`` why not '' ? she say . 
`` i be not good at that kind of thing '' . 
`` this afternoon let 's take an air with them . 
let 's be fine superior people of great dignity '' , he say as if he were joke . 
`` if you find it necessary , person , go_ahead '' , she say , turn on the stair . 
`` i be what i be . 
i can n't help it '' . 
her words remain with him , worry him for hours . 
he did n't know how she would behave with other people . 
when they walk into the person apartment , the old lady , bow and smile , say softly . 
`` ciao , '' and put_out her hand . 
her little brown face wrinkle up , her brown eye gleam , and with her little gesture she say all the courteous thing . 
person , smile too , say , `` ' ello '' , and_then more slowly , `` i be happy '' . 
and they sit_down and begin their little coffee party . 
the person offer them biscuit with the coffee . 
act only as interpreter person , her hand fold on her lap , be utterly impersonal . 
she would turn to them , then turn to him , then turn again . 
watch her , he feel like a spectator at a tennis game , with the ball being bounce back_and_forth . 
person , bob her head encouragingly , ask person about canada , have a special interest . 
person translate . 
the old_woman have a nephew from location , a poor boy from a lumber mill who had get tired_of the seasonal unemployment , and who had migrate to canada to work_on the railway . 
for a year the boy had live in the bush in a boxcar . 
did many_of person 's countryman live in boxcar in the bush ? 
had person ever live in a boxcar ? 
she want to know . 
regretfully person explain that he have no experience with boxcar . 
just_the_same , the old_woman say , she would write to her nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had meet a nice man from his adopted country . 
and person thank her , and hope he might meet her nephew back home , and ask her if she have any further news of the pope . 
a very great pope , this one , the old_woman explain , her black eye sparkling . 
an intellectual . 
but very mystical too . 
it was say that he had have a vision . 
just_as thousand that day in portugal had see the sun dancing in the sky , he had see the same thing later in his own garden , and she turn_to person for confirmation . 
person had been sit quietly , listen with the serenity of the unaware . 
now a little flush come_on her pale homely face and enchantment in her eye . 
the holy_father would die soon , she say to person , so she could translate for person , although he have a brilliant doctor , a man who did not need the assistance of those doctor offer by the great ruler of the world . 
yes , the pope could die and quickly be make a saint . 
no , he be indeed a saint now . 
nod approvingly and swell with importance , the old lady whisper confidentially . 
there be a certain discontent among the cardinal . 
the pope , in the splendor of his great intellect , had neglect them a_little . 
there would be change make , and person should understand that when the pope die it be like the end of a regime in rome . 
job would be lose and new face would become prominent . 
did person understand ? 
indeed he did , person say solemnly , try to get person 's eye . 
surely she could see that these woman be her italian , too , he think . 
devout , orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in brooklyn or location or location . 
but person ; eye be on person whose glowing face and softening eye give her a look of warmth and happiness . 
and person , watch in wonder , turn_to person . 
`` it mean so much to her . 
it 's like a flame , i guess '' , she say in a dreamy tone . 
there be a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun be hot . 
the new location pitcher turn_out to have an overhand fastball that took a hop . 
for a_few inning the location team could n't figure_out him out . 
then , in the fifth , location 's kid catcher catch onto a curve and smack the ball into left centerfield . 
person , location 's redheaded playing manager , run after the ball but it roll past him . 
person cut over to center from leftfield to get the relay . 
person catch_up_with the ball near the fence and throw it to person . 
`` third ! 
third_base '' ! 
person shout . 
person spin_around and make an accurate throw into person 's hand on third_base . 
person catch the ball just as the catcher slide into the bag . 
but the location boy had begin his slide too late . 
he come into the bag with his body and person bring the ball down full in his face . 
`` you bastard '' ! the person catcher scream . 
he jumped_to_his_feet and start to throw punch . 
person toss_away his glove away and begin to swing at the catcher . 
this bring in everybody from both side , while the spectator stand_up and add to the uproar . 
the fighter were separate in a_few minute . 
the game was resume . 
but person be boiling mad now . 
when the inning be over he curse the location catcher all_the_way into the dugout . 
person , come_in from leftfield , stop at the water_fountain for a drink . 
person was stand beside it , face the field . 
he was eye the person catcher warm_up his pitcher before the inning begin . 
`` keep your eye open , sonny '' ! 
person yell to the catcher . 
`` you 're in_for trouble '' . 
the location catcher did not reply with words . 
he simply turn_to person and smile . 
this so infuriate person that he spin_around and say : `` i 'll get that little bastard . 
so_help_me_god , i 'll get him '' . 
person say : `` why do n't you leave him alone '' ? 
`` mind your own goddamn business '' , person say . 
person shrug . 
he step into the dugout , wonder why person was always look_for trouble . 
maybe the answer be in his eye . 
when person smile his eye never fit_in with his lip . 
in the last of the sixth inning person get_up to bat and hit a fastball over the left_fielder 's head . 
by the time the fielder get his hand on the ball person was round third_base and head for home . 
the left_fielder throw and it be a good one . 
but person have no chance of being tag . 
the location catcher was straddle home_plate . 
all person had_to do be slide , fall_away , but instead , he ram into the catcher . 
both fall heavily to the ground . 
only person get to his feet . 
he go_back to touch home_plate , turn and walk to the dugout without look_back . 
the location player and their manager run out on the field . 
they pour water over their catcher 's face . 
he did not move . 
then the manager call_for a doctor . 
the location physician come down to look over the injured ballplayer . 
then , quickly , and a_little nervously , the doctor order a_couple_of ballplayer to carry the catcher into the dressing_room . 
person was sit on the bench , watch . 
when the ballplayer start to carry the catcher off the field he say : `` that ought to teach the sonofabitch '' . 
person , seat next to person , get_up and move to the other end of the bench . 
the location manager was come over to the location dugout . 
he was follow by four of his men . 
it begin to look as if something was going_to happen . 
person sit quietly watch the manager come nearer . 
person move over to person 's side . 
no one say a word . 
the location manager come right up to the dugout in_front of person . 
his face be flushed . 
`` person '' , the manager say , his voice pitched low , quiver . 
`` that be a rotten thing to do '' . 
`` for god 's sake '' , person say , wave the manager away . 
`` stop it , will you ? 
tell your guy not to block the plate '' . 
`` you did n't have_to ram him '' . 
`` that 's what you say '' . 
the location manager look at person . 
it be a cold and calculated look . 
he turn and go_back across the field to his dugout . 
he call_in the pitcher who had been pitch , and a big , heavy , powerfully built right hander move out to the mound for location . 
the game start again and in the eighth inning person come up to bat . 
everyone in the ballpark seem to be stand and shout . 
the first ball the hefty pitcher throw come in for person 's head . 
person fall into the dirt , the ball go over him . 
he arise slowly and brush himself off . 
he get back into the batter's_box and on the next pitch drop into the dirt again . 
`` hit the bum '' ! somebody yell from the location bench . 
in the location dugout person , shortstop , whisper into person 's ear : `` there 's gonna be a fight '' . 
`` look at those bastard '' ! 
person , a pitcher , say . 
`` they 're look_for trouble '' . 
person be slow get into the batter's_box this time . 
when he finally did he had_to duck his head quickly away as the pitch come_in . 
`` listen '' ! he shout to the pitcher . 
`` one more and i 'm come out there '' ! 
`` i 'll be wait '' ! the pitcher yell back . 
person pound the rubber plate with the end of his bat . 
he stand flat-footed in the batter's_box , but not very close to the plate now . 
the pitcher wind_up and the ball come in straight for person 's head . 
person drop , get_up , turn and , hold the bat with both hand up against his chest , begin to walk slowly out to the mound . 
the pitcher toss_away his glove away and come towards person . 
they were both walk towards each other , unhurried . 
location and location player rush_out on the field . 
in the next moment , it seem , the infield be crowded with spectator , ballplayer , cop , kid and a dog . 
there be much shouting and screaming . 
fight spring_up and were quickly squelch . 
person and the location pitcher were pull_away before they even come together . 
person and two other location player did not go out on the field when the fighting start . 
after the game , person was take_off his sweatshirt in the dressing_room when person come_in . 
`` it 's a helluva thing '' , person say , look at person , `` when a guy 's own teammate won n't come_out and help him in a fight '' . 
person sigh and pull the wet sweatshirt over his head . 
person sit_down on the bench near person . 
the other player were undress quietly . 
person had not come_in yet . 
person go over to person and stand over him . 
`` why the hell did n't you come_out when you see them gang_up on me '' ? 
`` i did n't think it be necessary '' . 
`` well ! 
now that 's just fine ! 
you did n't think it be necessary '' . 
person place both his hand on his hip . 
he push his jaw forward . 
`` listen , wise_guy , if you think i 'm gonna do all the fighting for this ball_club you 're crazy '' . 
person have a good two inch over person and person had_to look up into person 's face . 
`` i did n't ask you to fight for the ball_club '' , person say slowly . 
`` nobody else did , either '' . 
`` you try to say i start the fight '' ? 
`` i 'm not try to say anything '' . 
person turn_away and open his locker , and_then he hear person say : `` you 're yellow , person '' ! 
and person bang his locker door shut and spin_around . 
but before anything could happen person be between them and person had come into the dressing_room . 
`` person , come into my office '' , person say . 
person follow person into the office and shut the door . 
he sit_down before person 's desk . 
`` i 'm do you a favor '' , person say quickly . 
`` you get your unconditional release as of today '' . 
person 's eye widen just a_trifle . 
`` the best thing for you to do '' , person say , `` be go_home . 
you do n't belong in professional baseball '' . 
person had_to clear his throat . 
`` be this because of what happen out there '' ? 
`` no '' , person say . 
`` but it does confirm what i 've suspect all_along '' . 
person stand_up . 
`` listen ! 
this be the second time '' . 
`` sit_down , sit_down '' , person say . 
`` i 'm not say you 're yellow . 
i am say you 're not a professional ballplayer '' . 
person lean forward over the desk . 
`` now listen to me , person . 
i 'm not steer you wrong . 
you have_got n't got the heart for baseball '' . 
person shake his head and person frown . 
suddenly his voice grow hard . 
`` what the hell do you think baseball be ? 
you 're not in the big_league , but if you can n't give_and_take down here what the hell do you think it 'll be like up there '' ? 
person start to say something but person cut_short him short . 
`` now do n't tell me what a good ballplayer you be . 
i know you 've have_got talent . 
but what you have_got n't got be the heart to back_up that talent with . 
the heart , person . 
you just have_got n't got the heart for pro-ball , and that 's it '' . 
dazed , person say : `` i do n't get_it . 
my batting_average & & & '' . 
person stand_up abruptly , then sit_down just as abruptly . 
`` what difference does your batting_average make ? 
or your fielding_average . 
or even the way you run_bases . 
i tell you when it 's necessary to hurt in_order to win - you won n't do it . 
that 's what i mean by no heart for the game . 
baseball 's no cinch . 
person had no business ram into that kid out there . 
he do it because he know for each guy he put out_of_commission that 's one less who might take_away his job away later_on . 
what the hell do you think baseball be ? 
a sport ? 
it 's a way_of_life , goddamit ! 
and you 've got to be ready to cut_to_ribbons anybody who want to take_away your way_of_life away from you '' ! 
he 's wrong ! 
person think . 
it 's only his opinion . 
there be other club in this league . 
he stand_up slowly . 
he be a_little pale and shaky . 
his lip feel glued together . 
`` i think you 're wrong , person '' , he say finally . 
person nod . 
`` okay . 
you 'll get your pay in the morning '' . 
person turn and leave the room , hear person say : 
`` someday you 'll see i be right '' . 
person shut the door behind him . 
outside in the dressing_room , person sit on the bench dressed in his street_clothes . 
`` what happen '' ? 
person ask . 
person say : `` i get my release '' . 
`` you crazy '' ? 
person shrug . 
`` what for '' ? 
person sigh . 
person shake his head . 
`` i do n't get_it '' . 
`` i do n't know '' , person say . 
they be silent for a_few moment . 
then person say : `` what are you gonna do '' ? 
person start to take_off his clothes off and person sit_down on the bench again . 
person take_off one shoe and stare at it . 
`` do n't take it like this '' , person say . 
`` hell , plenty of guy get let_out and come_back later . 
the league be full of guy like that '' . 
person be very quiet . 
`` what are you gonna do , person '' ? 
person did not answer . 
`` why not try another club '' ? 
person look up . 
what the hell right did person have say a thing like that ? 
`` springfield 's in tomorrow '' , person say . 
`` talk to person '' . 
he just did n't know what he was talk_about , say a thing like that . 
`` will you do it , person '' ? 
`` do what '' ? 
`` ask person for a job '' . 
person nod . 
`` sure '' , he say . 
`` springfield come_in tomorrow '' ? 
person nod . 
`` i 'll speak_to person '' . 
`` atta_boy '' . 
`` i 'll talk to him , all_right '' . 
`` do n't worry '' , person say . 
`` you 'll get a job there . 
he need outfielder bad '' . 
`` i 'm not worry about it '' , person say . 
`` that 's the way to talk . 
what else did person have to say '' ? 
`` nothing '' , person say . 
up-to-date , however , his garden be still more_or_less of a mess , he had n't even start his workshop and if there was a meadow pond in the neighborhood he had n't find it . 
it was n't his fault that these thing be so . 
the difficulty be that each day seem to produce its quota of detail which must be clean_up immediately . 
as a result , life had become a kind of continuous makeready . 
once he dispose_of these item which screamed so harshly for attention , he could undertake the thing which really count . 
then , at_last , his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to read , or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon , accompanied by his dog . 
his dog ? 
he had almost forget them , although they had play such an important part in his early dream . 
then they had always been romp around him on these walk , yelp with delight , dash off into the bush on fruitless hunting_expedition , return to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paw . 
dog do something to one 's ego . 
they were constantly assure you that you be one of the world 's great guy . 
regardless_of how much of a slob you know yourself to be , you could be certain they would never find_out - and even if they did it would make no difference . 
now it become increasingly apparent that there were to be no dog in the picture . 
what in the world were you going to do with a_lot_of dog when you leave for town on monday afternoon ? 
you certainly could n't take them into the little apartment and if you try to farm_out them out for two or three day every_week they would become so confused that they would have nervous_breakdown . 
why in the world could n't he live in one place the way everyone else seem to ? 
it worry him , this inability to get the simple thing done in the course of a day . 
he would wake_up in_the_middle of the night and fret about it . 
how in the world had he formerly find time to build_up a business , raise a family , be on half_a_dozen board , work actively on committee and either go_out in the evening or plow through the content of a bulging briefcase ? 
was it possible that as people grow older the nature of time change ? 
could it be that it speed_up for the aged in some mysterious way , as if a bored universe were skip through the end of the chapter just to get_it_over_with ? 
or be the answer less metaphysical ? 
did old people work more slowly ? 
did it take a man of sixty-five longer to write a letter , shave , clean_out a barn , read a newspaper , than a man of thirty ? 
did man become perfectionist as they grow older , polish , polish , reluctant to let_go ? 
it might be that certain people be_born with a compulsion to complicate their life , while others could live blissfully motionless almost indefinitely , like lizard in the sun , too indolent to blink their eye . 
perhaps it was his misfortune , or good_fortune , whichever way one look_at it , to belong_to the former group , and he was struggle unconsciously to build_up pressure in a world which demand none , which be positively antagonistic to_it . 
and then_again perhaps the reason why he could n't find time to do any of the thing he had plan to do after retirement : read , roam , garden , lie on his back and watch the cloud go_by , be because he did n't want to do them . 
there was no compulsion behind them . 
they could be done or leave undone and nobody really gave_a_damn . 
during all his busy life he had only do thing which had to be do . 
this habit had become so fixed over the year that it seem futile to do anything for which no_one was wait . 
he look at the luminous dial of his wrist_watch . 
it was five minute after four . 
on some distant farm a rooster crow and , far down the valley , an associate answer . 
he turn_over impatiently and pull the sheet over his head against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn . 
at_least he could buy the equipment for his workshop . 
thus committed , action might follow . 
he go down to group 's hardware_store and buy a full set of carpenter 's tool , include a rotary power_saw and several other piece of power machinery that person say be essential for babbiting and doweling , whatever they be . 
he also buy a huge square of pegboard for hang_up his tool , and lumber for his workbench , sandpaper and glue and assorted nail , level and t-square and plumb_line and several gadget that he have no idea how to use or what they be for . 
`` there '' , say person . 
`` that 'll get you started . 
best not to get everything at_once . 
add thing as you find you need ' em '' . 
he did n't even ask the cost of this collection . 
after_all , if you were going to set_up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that was that . 
when he return home , the station_wagon loaded with tool , person had go with a friend to some meeting in the village , use the recently purchase second car . 
he be glad . 
it give him a chance to unload the stuff and get_down it down to the cellar without a barrage of acid comment . 
he had make such a fuss about buy that second car that he know he be vulnerable . 
he pile everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turn to stare at the blank stone wall . 
that be where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand_tool . 
in_front of it would be his workbench . 
the old nightmare which had cause him so many wakeful hour come charge in on him once_more , only this time he could n't pacify it with a sleeping_pill and send it away . 
how in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall ? 
how did one attach anything to a stone wall , for_that_matter ? 
after the pegboard there would be the paneling . 
he sit_down on an old box and focus_on the problem . 
perhaps one bore hole in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget . 
but then , when you stick thing into the hole , why did n't they come_out right out again ? 
it all seem rather hopeless . 
he turn his attention to the workbench . 
perhaps that be the first thing to do . 
a workbench have a heavy top and sturdy leg , but how did you attach sturdy leg to a heavy top so that the whole_thing did n't wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you lean_on it ? 
person had do some figure on a scrap of paper and give him the various kind of board and two-by-four which , properly handle , would , he had assure him , turn_into a workbench . 
they lie on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile . 
person poke_at it gingerly with his foot . 
how could anyone know what to do with an assortment like that ? 
perhaps he had_better have someone help him put_up the pegboard and build the workbench - someone who know what he was about . 
then at_least he would have a place to hang his tool and something to work on . 
after that everything should be simple . 
he go upstairs to phone person . 
to his amazement he reach him . 
person be laid_up with a bad cold . 
he did n't seem to think that attach a pegboard to a stone wall be much of a problem and he tossed_off the building of the worktable equally lightly . 
the only trouble be that he himself be tied_up on the school job . 
that be why he had n't be able to finish the porch . 
no , he did n't know of any handyman carpenter . 
there was n't any such thing anymore . 
carpenter all want steady work and at the moment every mother's_son for twenty mile around that could hammer nail for twenty-five dollar a day was work_on the school job . 
there was a fellow named person over location way . 
nobody like to hire him because you never could tell when he was going_to be take drunk . 
person would probably see him at group meeting the next night . 
if he be sober , which be doubtful , he 'd have him get_in_touch with person . 
person had be at_least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turn_out to be the greatest boon that had come into person 's life since he move to location , in_spite_of the fact that he did n't work very fast or very long at_a_time , and he did n't like to work at_all unless person hang_around and talk to him . 
he say he be the lonely type and work in a cellar you see funny thing come out of the crack in the wall if they be n't nobody with you . 
so person sit on a wooden box and talk in_order to keep person 's mind from funny thing . 
at_the_same_time he watch carefully to see how one attach pegboard to stone wall , but person was usually stand in his line_of_vision and it all seem so simple that he did n't like to disclose his ignorance . 
while person was put_up the pegboard and start the workbench , person tell him of this idea about panel the whole end of the cellar . 
person agree that this would be pretty . 
without further discussion he appear the next morning with a pile of board sticking over the end of his light truck and proceed with the paneling , which he then stain and wax according_to his taste . 
`` now '' , he say , `` we got to put_in some outlet for them power_tool ; then a_couple_of fluorescent lamp over the workbench an ' i guess we be about through down here '' . 
it all did look very efficient and shipshape . 
there was no question of_that . 
`` by_the_way '' , say person , pack his tool into a battered carrier , `` them power_tool need extra voltage . 
i guess you know about that . 
before you use ' em the light company 's have_got to run in a heavy line and you 'll need a new fuse box for the extra circuit . 
that be n't too bad ' ceptin ' the light_company 's so busy you can n't ever get ' em to do nothin '' ' . 
instead of being depress by this news , person be actually relieved . 
at_least the moment be postponed when he had_to face the mystery of the power_tool . 
he follow person up the cellar stairs . 
as_usual , person was stand in_the_midst of a confusion of cooking_utensil . 
person sit_down in the only unoccupied kitchen chair . 
`` well '' , he say , `` get your man fix_up nicely down there . 
he oughta be able to build a new house with all them contraption '' . 
person watch his wife with an anxious expression . 
`` i was just say ' to him that i be all ready now for anything else you want do '' . 
person could n't remember his say any such thing . 
`` oh , that be wonderful '' , cry person . 
`` i have a_thousand thing for you to do . 
door that won n't open , and door that won n't close and shelf and broken '' . 
`` but those be the thing i build the workshop for '' , protest person . 
`` those be the thing i can do , now that i be set_up '' . 
`` i 've been wait to get these thing done for month '' , she say . 
`` we won n't live long enough if i wait for you , besides which you do n't need to worry - there 'll be plenty more '' . 
but the discussion be academic . 
person was already take measurement for a shelf above the kitchen_sink . 
several defendants in the summerdale police burglary trial make statements indicate their guilt at_the_time of their arrest , judge_james_b._parsons was tell in criminal_court yesterday . 
the disclosure by charles_bellows , chief defense counsel , startle observers and was view_as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys represent the eight former policemen now on trial . 
bellows make the disclosure when he ask judge_parsons to grant his client , alan_clements , 30 , a separate trial . 
bellows make the request while the all-woman jury be out of the courtroom . 
`` the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client '' , bellows tell the court . 
`` some of the defendants strongly indicate they know they were receive stolen_property . 
it be impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants make statements involve themselves and_others '' . 
judge_parsons lean over the bench and inquire , `` you mean some of the defendants make statements admit this '' ? 
`` yes , your honor '' , reply bellows . 
`` what this amount to , if true , be that there will be a free-for-all fight in_this case . 
there be a conflict among the defendants '' . 
president_kennedy today push_aside other white_house business to devote all his time and attention to work_on the berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the american people over nationwide television and radio . 
the president spend much of the week-end at his summer home on cape_cod write the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of white_house aids in washington with whom he talk by telephone . 
shortly after the chief_executive return to washington in midmorning from hyannis_port , mass. , a white_house spokesman say the address text still have `` quite a way_to_go '' toward completion . 
ask to elaborate , pierre_salinger , white_house press secretary , reply , `` i would say it 's got to go thru several more drafts '' . 
salinger say the work president_kennedy , advisers , and members of his staff were do on the address involve composition and wording , rather_than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest berlin crisis precipitate by russia 's demands and proposals for the city . 
the last 10 cases in the investigation of the nov .8 election were dismiss yesterday by acting_judge_john_m._karns , who charge that the prosecution obtain evidence `` by unfair and fundamentally illegal means '' . 
karns say that the cases involve a matter `` of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence '' of the 50 persons . 
he say evidence was obtain `` in violation of the legal_rights of citizens '' . 
karns ' ruling pertain to eight of the 10 cases . 
in the two other cases he rule that the state had be `` unable to make a case '' . 
contempt proceedings originally had been bring against 677 persons in 133 precincts by morris_j._wexler , special prosecutor . 
wexler admit in earlier court hearings that he issue grand_jury subpenas to about 200 persons involve in the election investigation , question the individuals in the criminal_courts building , but did not take them before the grand_jury . 
mayer_goldberg , attorney for election judges in the 58 th precinct of the 23 d ward , argue this procedure constitute intimidation . 
wexler has deny repeatedly that coercion was use in questioning . 
karns say it be a `` wrongful act '' for wexler to take statements `` privately and outside of the grand_jury room '' . 
he say this constitute a `` very serious misuse '' of the criminal_court processes . 
`` actually , the abuse of the process may have constitute a contempt of the criminal_court of cook county , altho vindication of the authority of_that court be not the function of_this court '' , say karns , who be a city judge in east st._louis sit in cook_county court . 
karns had been schedule this week to hear seven cases involve 35 persons . 
wexler had charge the precinct judges in these cases with `` complementary '' miscount of the vote , in_which votes would be take from one candidate and give to another . 
the cases involve judges in the 33 d , 24 th , and 42 d precincts of the 31 st ward , the 21 st and 28 th precincts of the 29 th ward , the 18 th precinct of the 4 th ward , and the 9 th precinct of the 23 d ward . 
the case of the judges in the 58 th precinct of the 23 d ward had been hear previously and take under advisement by karns . 
two other cases also be under advisement . 
after read his statement discharge the 23 d ward case , karns tell wexler that if the seven cases schedule for trial also involve persons who had been subpoena , he would dismiss them . 
president_kennedy today propose a mammoth new medical_care program whereby social_security taxes on 70 million american workers would be raise to pay the hospital and some other medical_bills of 14.2 million americans over 65 who are covered by social_security or railroad retirement programs . 
the president , in a special message to congress , tie_in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships , build 20 new medical and 20 new dental_schools , and expand child health_care and general medical research . 
the aged care plan , similar to one the president sponsor last year as a senator , a fight on capitol_hill . 
it was defeat in congress last year . 
it would be finance by boost the social_security payroll tax by as much_as $ 37 a year for each of the workers now pay such taxes . 
the social_security payroll tax be now 6 per_cent - 3 per_cent on each worker and employer - on the first $ 4800 of pay per_year . 
the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $ 5000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per_cent - 3.25 per_cent each . 
similar payroll tax_boosts would be impose on those under the railroad retirement system . 
the payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per_cent start jan. 1 , 1963 , if the plan is approve , because the levy is already scheduled to go_up by 1 per_cent on_that date to pay for other social_security costs . 
officials estimate the annual tax_boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits pay_out would run 1 billion or more in the first year , 1963 . 
both figures would go higher in later years . 
other parts of the kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years . 
these would be pay for out of general , not payroll , taxes . 
the aged care plan carry these benefits for persons over 65 who be under the social_security and railroad retirement systems : 
full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness , except that the patient would pay $ 10 a day of the cost for the first nine days . 
full payment of nursing_home bills for up_to 180 days following discharge from a hospital . 
a patient could receive up_to 300 days paid-for nursing_home care under a `` unit formula '' allow more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit . 
hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in_excess of $ 20 a patient . 
community visiting_nurse services at_home for up_to 240 days an illness . 
the president note that congress last year pass a law provide grants to states to help pay medical_bills of the needy aged . 
he say his plan is design to `` meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers ' expense , but who are nevertheless stagger by the drain on their savings - or those of their children - cause by an extended hospital stay '' . 
`` this be a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs '' , he say , `` and with sufficient ' deductible ' requirements to discourage any malinger or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals . 
`` this be not a program of socialized medicine . 
it be a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guarantee . 
every person will choose his own doctor and hospital '' . 
the plan does not cover doctor bills . 
they would still be pay by the patient . 
apart from the aged care plan the president 's most ambitious and costly proposals be for federal scholarships , and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental_schools . 
the president say the nation 's 92 medical and 47 dental_schools cannot now handle the student load need to meet the rise need for health_care . 
moreover , he say , many qualified young people are not go into medicine and dentistry because they can n't afford the schooling costs . 
the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental_school equal_to $ 1500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students . 
the schools could use the money to pay 4 - year scholarships , base on need , of up_to $ 2000 a year per student . 
in_addition , the government would pay a $ 1000 `` cost of education '' grant to the schools for each $ 1500 in scholarship grants . 
officials estimate the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go_up to 21 millions by 1966 . 
the president recommend federal `` matching grants '' total 700 million dollars in 10 years for construct new medical and dental_schools or enlarge the capacity of existing ones . 
in the area of `` community health services '' , the president call_for double the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing_home construction . 
he ask for another 10 million dollar `` initial '' appropriation for `` stimulatory grants '' to states to improve nursing_homes . 
he further propose grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals . 
in the child health field , the president say he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children 's bureau . 
he also ask congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute . 
the president say he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation . 
he did not say by how much . 
for medical research he ask a 20 million dollar a year increase , from 30 to 50 millions , in matching grants for build research facilities . 
the president say he will also propose increase , by an unspecified amount , the 540 million dollars in the 1961 - 62 budget for direct government research in medicine . 
the president say his proposals combine the `` indispensable elements in a sound health program - people , knowledge , services , facilities , and the means to pay for them '' . 
congressional reaction to the message be along expected lines . 
legislators who last year oppose place aged-care under the social_security system criticize the president 's plan . 
those who back a similar plan last year hail the message . 
senate_republican_leader_dirksen [ ill . ] and house_republican_leader_charles_halleck [ ind . ] say the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance . 
halleck say the voluntary care plan enact last year should be give a fair trial first . 
house_speaker_sam_rayburn [ d. , tex . ] call the kennedy program `` a mighty fine thing '' , but made no prediction on its fate in the house . 
act hastily under white_house pressure , the senate tonight confirm robert_c._weaver as the nation 's federal housing chief . 
only 11 senators be on the floor and there be no record vote . 
a_number_of scattered `` ayes '' and `` noes '' was hear . 
customary_senate rules were ignore in_order_to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency . 
in the last eight years , all presidential appointments , include those of cabinet rank , have been deny immediate action because of a senate rule require at_least a 24 hour delay after they are report to the floor . 
the rule was enforce by demand of sen._wayne_morse [ d. , ore . ] in connection with president_eisenhower 's cabinet selections in 1953 and president_kennedy 's in 1961 . 
the_most positive element to emerge from the oslo meeting of north_atlantic_treaty_organization foreign_ministers has be the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual_understanding than in past meetings . 
this has be a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step_by_step and without dramatic changes . 
in oslo , the ministers have meet in a climate of candor , and make a genuine attempt to get information and understand one another 's problems . 
this atmosphere of understanding has be particularly noticeable where relations are concern between the `` colonialist '' powers and those who have never , or not for a long_time , have such problems . 
the nightmare of a clash between those in_trouble in africa , exacerbate by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies face them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have bring these troubles about , has be conspicious by its absence . 
in the case of portugal , which a_few weeks ago was rumor ready_to walk_out_of the nato_council should critics of its angola policy prove harsh , there has be a noticeable relaxation of tension . 
the general , remarkably courteous , explanation has leave basic positions unchanged , but there has be no explosion in the council . 
there should even be no_more bitter surprises in the un general_assembly as to nato members ' votes , since a new ad_hoc nato committee has been set_up so_that in_the_future such topics as angola will be discuss in_advance . 
canada alone has be somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato locomotive . 
even norway , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of_this northernmost capital of the alliance , be today closer to the nato line . 
on_the_negative_side of the balance_sheet must be set some disappointment that the united_states leadership has not be as much in_evidence as hoped_for . 
one diplomat describe the tenor of secretary_of_state dean_rusk 's speeches as `` inconclusive '' . 
but he hasten to add that , if united_states policies be not always clear , despite mr._rusk 's analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the west , this may merely mean the new administration has not_yet firmly fix its policy . 
a certain vagueness may also be cause by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting be a semipublic affair , with no_fewer_than six soviet correspondents accredit . 
the impression has nevertheless been give during these three days , despite mr._rusk 's personal popularity , that the united_states delegation come to oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame_of_mind , more ready_to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots . 
the secretary_of_state himself , in his first speech , give some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the united_states that has preoccupy the new administration in_the_past four months . 
but where the core of nato be concerned , the secretary_of_state has not_only reiterate the united_states ' profound attachment to the alliance , `` cornerstone '' of its foreign_policy , but has announce that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at nato 's disposal in european waters . 
the secretary_of_state has also solemnly repeat a warning to the soviet_union that the united_states will not stand_for another setback in berlin , an affirmation once_again take_up by the council as_a_whole . 
the secretary 's greatest achievement be perhaps the rekindling of nato realization that east-west friction , wherever it take_place around the globe , be in_essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies , and must be treat as_such without regard_to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection . 
the annual spring meeting has give an impetus in three main directions : more , deeper , and more timely political consultation within the alliance , the use of the organization for economic_cooperation and development ( when ratify ) as a method of coordinate aid to the underdeveloped countries , and the need for strengthen conventional forces as_well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent . 
this increase in the `` threshold '' , as the conventional forces strengthen is call , will prove one of the alliance 's most difficult problems in the months to come . 
each ally will have to carry_out obligations long_since lay_down , but never completely fulfil . 
the kennedy administration move haltingly toward a geneva conference on laos just_as serious debate over its foreign_policy erupt for_the_first_time . 
there be little optimism here that the communists will be any_more docile at the conference_table than they be in military_actions on_the_ground in laos . 
the united_states , state_department officials explain , now be mainly interested in set_up an international inspection system which will prevent laos from being use as a base for communist attacks on neighboring thailand and south viet_nam . 
they count_on the aid of the neutral countries attend the geneva conference to achieve this . 
the united_states hope that any future lao_cabinet would not become communist dominated . 
but it be apparent that no acceptable formula has been find to prevent such a possibility . 
the inclination here is to accept a de_facto cease-fire in laos , rather_than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the geneva conference . 
this be another of the modifications of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has feel compelled to make . 
it excuse these actions as be the chain_reaction to basic errors make in the previous administration . 
its spokesmen insist that there has not be time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas . 
but with the months move_on - and the immediate confrontations with the communists show no gain for the free_world - the question arise : 
how effective have kennedy administration first foreign_policy decisions be in deal with communist aggression ? 
former vice-president_richard_m._nixon in detroit call_for a firmer and tougher policy toward the soviet_union . 
he be critical of_what he feel be president_kennedy 's tendency to be too conciliatory . 
it does not take a gallup poll to find_out that most republicans in congress feel this understate the situation as republicans see it . 
they can hardly restrain themselves from raise the question of whether republicans , if they had be in power , would have make `` amateurish and monumental blunders '' in cuba . 
one republican senator tell this correspondent that he was constantly being ask why he did n't attack the kennedy administration on this score . 
his reply , he say , was that he agree to the need for unity in the country now . 
but he further say that it be better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first . 
the republicans some weeks ago serve notice through senator_thruston_b._morton ( r ) of kentucky , chairman of the republican_national_committee , that the kennedy administration would be hold responsible if the outcome in laos be a coalition government susceptible of communist domination . 
kennedy administration policies also have been assail now from another direction by 70 harvard , boston_university , brandeis , and massachusetts_institute of technology educators . 
this group plead with the administration to `` give no further support for the invasion of cuba by exile groups '' . 
it recommend that the united_states `` seek instead to detach the castro regime from the communist bloc by work for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations ; and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminate in other parts of latin_america the social conditions on_which totalitarian nationalism feed '' . 
mr._nixon , for his part , would oppose intervention in cuba without specific provocation . 
but he did recommend that president_kennedy state clearly that if communist countries ship any further arms to cuba that it would not be tolerate . 
until the cuban fiasco and the communist military victories in laos , almost any observer would have say that president_kennedy had blend a program that respect , generally , the opinions voice both by mr._nixon and the professors . 
very early in his administration he inform the kremlin through diplomatic channels , a high official source disclose , that the new administration would react even tougher than the eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration . 
strenuous efforts were make to remove pin prick from administration statements . 
policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were review and change . 
but thus_far there has be no response in_kind . 
foreign aid programs were revamp to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations . 
in laos , the administration look_at the eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into southeast asian waters as a useless gesture . 
again_and_again it ask the communists to `` freeze '' the military situation in laos . 
but the communists aid the pathet_lao at an even faster rate . 
and after several correspondents go_into pathet_lao territory and expose the huge build-up , administration spokesmen acclaim them for perform a `` great service '' and lay the_matter before the southeast_asia_treaty_organization . 
seato be steamed up and prepare contingency plans for cope_with the military losses in laos . 
but the communists never give sufficient provocation at any one_time for the united_states to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over laos . 
( some seato nations disagree , however . ) 
there be the further complication that the administration had very early conclude that laos be ill_suited to be an ally , unlike its more determined neighbors , thailand and south viet_nam . 
the administration declare itself in favor of a neutralized laos . 
the pro-western government , which the united_states had help in a revolt against the souvanna_phouma `` neutralist '' government , never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the royal_lao_army . 
there certainly was not_any more energy display after it was clear the united_states would not back the pro-western government to_the_hilt . 
if the administration ever have any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to prince_souvanna_phouma , whom it feel be too trusting of communists , it gradually had to relinquish them . 
one factor be the statement of senator_j._w._fulbright ( d ) of arkansas , chairman of the senate_foreign relations committee . 
he declare on march_25 that the united_states had err a year and a half ago by `` encourage the removal '' of prince_souvanna . 
the white_house is take extraordinary steps to check the rapid_growth of juvenile_delinquency in the united_states . 
the president be deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the `` vitality of the nation '' . 
in an important assertion of national leadership in_this field , he has issue an executive order establish the president 's committee on juvenile_delinquency and crime , to be support and assist by a citizens advisory_council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems . 
the president ask the support and cooperation of congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combat this disturbing crime trend . 
the president has also call_upon the attorney_general , the secretary of health , education and welfare , and the secretary of labor to coordinate their efforts `` in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope_with the problem . 
simultaneously the president announce thursday the appointment of david_l._hackett , a special assistant ot the attorney_general , as executive_director of the new committee on juvenile_delinquency and youth crime . 
his sense of urgency in_this matter stem from the fact that court cases ond juvenile arrests have more_than double since 1948 , each_year show an increase in offenders . 
among arrests report by the federal_bureau of investigation in 1959 , about half for burglary and larceny involve persons under 18 years of_age . 
east_providence should organize its civil_defense setup and begin by appoint a full-time director , raymond_h._hawksley , the present city cd head , believe . 
mr._hawksley say yesterday he would be willing to go before the city_council `` or anyone else locally '' to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time . 
east_providence now have no civil_defense program . 
mr._hawksley , the state 's general treasurer , has be a part-time cd director in the city for the last nine years . 
he be not interested in being name a full-time director . 
note that president_kennedy has hand the defense_department the major responsibility for the nation 's civil_defense program , mr._hawksley say the federal_government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director . 
he express the opinion the city could hire a cd director for about $ 3500 a year and would only have to put_up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs . 
mr._hawksley say he believe there be a_number_of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time cd job . 
one of these men be former fire_chief john_a._laughlin , he say . 
along with a director , the city should provide a cd headquarters so_that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized . 
mr._hawksley say . 
one advantage that would come to the city in have a full-time director , he say , be that east_providence would become eligible to apply to the federal_government for financial_aid in purchase equipment need for a sound civil_defense program . 
matching funds also can be obtain for procurement of such items as radios , sirens and rescue trucks , he say . 
mr._hawksley believe that east_providence could use two more rescue trucks , similar to the cd vehicle obtain several years ago and now detail to the central fire_station . 
he would assign one of the rescue trucks to the riverside section of the city and the other to the rumford area . 
speak of the present status of civil_defense in the city , mr._hawksley say he would be willing to bet that not more_than one person in a_hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack . 
the narragansett_race_track grounds be one assembly point , he say , and a drive-in theater in seekonk would be another . 
riverside residents would go_to the seekonk assembly point . 
mr._hawksley say he be not critical of city residents for not know what to do or where to assemble in_case of an air_attack . 
such vital information , he say , has to be make available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know . 
if the city_council fail to consider appointment of a full-time cd director , mr._hawksley say , then he plan to call a meeting early in september so_that a civil_defense organization will be develop locally . 
one of the first things he would do , he say , would be to organize classes in first_aid . 
other steps would be develop after information drift down to the local level from the federal_government . 
rhode_island is going to examine its sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind . 
governor_notte say last night he plan to name a committee to make the study and come_up with recommendations for possible changes in_time for the next session of the general_assembly . 
the governor 's move into the so-called `` blue_law '' controversy come in the form of a letter to miss_mary_r._grant , deputy city clerk of central_falls .

the governor write miss_grant that he has be concerned for_some_time `` with the continuous problem which confront our local and state law_enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulate sunday sales '' . 
the attorney_general has advise local police that it be their duty to enforce the_blue laws . 
should there be evidence they are shirk , he has say , the state police will step_into the situation . 
there has be more activity across the state_line in massachusetts than in rhode_island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the sunday sales laws . 
the statutes , similar in both the bay_state and rhode_island and date_back in some instances to colonial times , severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sell on the sabbath . 
the central_falls city_council express concern especially that more foods be place on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allow to do business on sunday . 
the only day they `` have a chance to compete with large supermarkets be on sunday '' , the council 's resolution say . 
the small shops `` must be retain , for they provide essential service to the community '' , according to the resolution , which add that they `` also be the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors '' . 
it declare that sunday sales licenses provide `` great revenue '' to the local_government . 
the council advise the governor that `` large supermarkets , factory outlets and department_stores not be allow to do business '' on sunday . 
they `` operate on a volume basis '' , it was contend , `` and be not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community '' . 
liberals and conservatives in both parties - democratic and republican - should divorce themselves and form two independent parties , george_h._reama , nationally known labor-management expert , say here yesterday . 
mr._reama tell the rotary_club of providence at its luncheon at the sheraton-biltmore_hotel that about half of the people in the country want the `` welfare '' type of government and the other half want a free_enterprise system . 
he suggest that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election_day . 
he say he was `` confess that i be a member of the socialist_party in 1910 '' . 
that , he add , be when he be `` a very young_man , a machinist and toolmaker by trade . 
`` that be before i study law . 
some of my fellow_workers were groom me for an office in the socialist_party . 
the lawyer with whom i study law steer me off the socialist track . 
he steer me to the right track - the free_enterprise track '' . 
he say that when he be a socialist in 1910 , the party call_for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources . 
he suggest that without the socialist_party ever gain a national victory , most_of its original program has come to pass under both major parties . 
mr._reama , who retire as vice_president of the american_screw_co. in 1955 say , `` both parties in the last election tell us that we need a five per_cent growth in the gross_national_product - but neither tell us how to achieve it '' . 
he say he favor wage increases for workers - `` but manufacturers are catch in a profit squeeze '' - and raises should only come when the public is condition to higher prices , he add . 
indicate the way in_which he has turn his back on his 1910 philosophy , mr._reama say : `` a socialist be a person who believe_in divide everything he does not own '' .

william_a._martinelli , chairman of the citizens group of johnston , transfer the petitions from his left_hand to his right_hand after the council vote to accept them at the suggestion of council_president_raymond_fortin_sr. .

he say that the group have no candidates for the charter commission in mind at_present , but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when_the_time_comes . 
`` after inspire this , i think we should certainly follow_through on it '' , he declare .

some opposition to the home_rule movement start to be hear yesterday , with spokesmen for the town 's insurgent democratic leadership speak out against the home_rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter . 
increase opposition can be expect in coming weeks , it was indicate . 
misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home_rule charter was cite as a factor which has cause the citizens group to obtain signatures under what were term `` false pretenses '' . 
several signers affix their names , it was learn , after being tell that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the general_assembly and that a provision could be include in the charter to have the town take_over the johnston_sanitary_district sewer_system .

james_p._mitchell and sen._walter_h._jones_r-bergen , last night disagree on the value of use as a campaign issue a remark by richard_j._hughes , democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the gop is `` campaign on the carcass of eisenhower_republicanism '' . 
mitchell be for use it , jones against , and sen._wayne_dumont_jr._r-warren did not mention it when the three republican gubernatorial candidates speak at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the park_hotel . 
the controversial remark was first make sunday by hughes at a westfield_young_democratic_club cocktail_party at the scotch_plains country_club . 
it was greet with a chorus of boos by 500 women in trenton_monday at a forum of the state_federation of women 's clubs . 
hughes say monday , `` it be the apparent intention of the republican_party to campaign on the carcass of_what they call eisenhower_republicanism , but the heart stop beat and the lifeblood congeal after eisenhower retire . 
now he 's gone , the republican_party is not go to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state '' . 
sunday he had add , `` we can love eisenhower the man , even if we consider him a mediocre president but there be nothing left of the republican_party without his leadership '' . 
mitchell say the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign . 
`` how can a man with any degree of common decency charge this '' ? 
he ask . 
the former secretary of labor say he be proud to be an eisenhower_republican `` and proud to have absorb his philosophy '' while work in his adminstration . 
mitchell say the closeness of the outcome in last fall 's presidential election did not mean that eisenhower_republicanism be a dead issue . 
jones say he regret hughes had make a personal attack on a past president . 
`` he be wrong to inject eisenhower into this campaign '' , he say , `` because the primary is being wage on state issues and i will not be force into re-argue an old national campaign '' . 
the audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of hughes ' remark . 
dumont speak on the merit of have an open_primary . 
he then launch into what the issues should be in the campaign . 
state aid to schools , the continuance of railroad passenger service , the proper uses of surplus funds of the port of new_york authority , and make new_jersey attractive to new industry . 
mitchell decry the high rate of unemployment in the state and say the meyner administration and the republican-controlled state_senate `` must share the blame for this '' . 
nothing that plainfield last year had lose the mack_truck_co. plant , he say industry will not come into this state until there be tax reform . 
`` but i be not in favor of a sales or state income_tax at this time '' , mitchell say . 
jones , unhappy that the candidates be limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions , save his barbs for mitchell . 
he say mitchell be against the centralization of government in washington but look_to the kennedy_administration for aid to meet new_jersey school and transportation crises . 
`` he call_for help while say he be against centralization , but you can n't have it both ways '' , jones say . 
the state is now face with the immediate question of raise new taxes whether on utilities , real_estate or motor_vehicles , he say , `` and i challenge mitchell to tell the people where he stand on the tax issue '' . 
earlier , mitchell say in a statement : 
`` i think that all americans will resent deeply the statements make about president_eisenhower by richard_j._hughes . 
his reference_to ' discredited carcass ' or ' tattered remains ' of the president 's leadership be an insult to the man who lead our forces to victory in the greatest war in_all history , to the man who be twice elect overwhelmingly by the american people as president_of_the_united_states , and who has be the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations . 
`` i find it hard to understand how anyone seek a position in_public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste . 
`` such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemn a man of world stature . 
it can only rebound to mr._hughes ' discredit '' . 
sen._charles_w._sandman , r-cape_may , say today jones will run well ahead of his gop opponents for the gubernatorial nomination . 
sandman , state campaign chairman for jones , was address a meeting in the military_park_hotel , newark , of essex_county leaders and campaign managers for jones . 
sandman tell the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all_over the state indicate that jones will be choose the republican_party 's nominee with the largest majority give a candidate in recent years . 
sandman say : `` the announcement that sen._clifford_case_r-n._j. , has decide to spend all his available time campaign for mr._mitchell be a dead giveaway . 
it be a desperate effort to prop_up a sagging candidate who has prove he cannot answer any questions about new_jersey 's problems . 
`` we have witness in_this campaign the effort to project mr._mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from washington . 
that fail . 
`` we are now witness an effort to transfer to mr._mitchell some of the glow of sen._case 's candidacy of last year . 
that , too , will fail '' . 
sandman announce the appointment of mrs._harriet_copeland_greenfield of 330 woodland_ave. , westfield , as state chairman of the republican_women for jones_committee . 
mrs._greenfield be president of the westfield_women 's republican_club and be a westfield county committeewoman . 
county_supervisor_weldon_r._sheets , who be a candidate for the democratic gubernatorial nomination , today call_for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them . 
the proposal , sheets say , represent part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in new_jersey more_than a `` lip_service word '' . 
sheets say that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting_machines , enable counties to repay the loan over a 10 - year period without interest or charge . 
sheets add that he would ask for exclusive use of voting_machines in the state by january , 1964 . 
although he point_out that mandatory legislation impinge_on home_rule be basically distasteful , he add that the vital interest in election results transcend county_lines . 
the candidacy of mayor_james_j._sheeran of west_orange , for the republican nomination for sheriff of essex_county , was support today by edward_w._roos , west_orange public safety commissioner . 
sheeran , a lawyer and former fbi man is_running against the republican organization 's candidate , freeholder_william_macdonald , for the vacancy leave by the resignation of neil_duffy , now a member of the state_board of tax appeals . 
`` my experience as public safety commissioner '' , roos say , `` has show me that the office of sheriff be best filled by a man with law_enforcement experience , and preferably one who be a lawyer .

but we 'll have a liberal , well planned , forward look , honest platform .

resentment well_up yesterday among democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that mayor_wagner had decide to seek a third term with paul_r._screvane and abraham_d._beame as running_mates . 
at_the_same_time reaction among anti-organization democratic leaders and in the liberal_party to the mayor 's reported plan be generally favorable . 
some anti-organization democrats see in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the democratic_party that has been go_on for the last three years . 
the resentment among democratic organization leaders to the reported wagner plan was direct particularly at the mayor 's efforts to name his own running_mates without consult the leaders . 
some view this attempt as evidence that mr._wagner regard_as himself as bigger than the party . 
some democratic district and county leaders are report try to induce state_controller_arthur_levitt of brooklyn to oppose mr._wagner for the mayoral nomination in the sept. 7 democratic primary . 
these contend there be a serious question as to whether mr._wagner have the confidence of the democratic rank_and_file in the city . 
their view be that last-minute changes the mayor is propose to make in the democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as mayor . 
in an apparent effort to head_off such a rival primary slate , mr._wagner talk by telephone yesterday with representative_charles_a._buckley , the_bronx democratic leader , and with joseph_t._sharkey , the brooklyn democratic leader . 
as_usual , he made no attempt to get_in_touch with carmine_g._de_sapio , the manhattan leader . 
he be publicly on record as believe mr._de_sapio should be replace for the good of the party . 
last night the mayor visit mr._buckley at the_bronx leader 's home for a discussion of the situation . 
apparently he believe mr._buckley hold the key to the democratic organization 's acceptance of his choices for running_mates without a struggle . 
in talks with mr._buckley last week in washington , the mayor apparently receive the_bronx leader 's assent to drop controller_lawrence_e._gerosa , who live in the_bronx , from this year 's ticket . 
but mr._buckley seem to have assume he would be give the right to pick mr._gerosa 's successor . 
the mayor decline in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decide to run and want mr._screvane , who live in queens , to replace abe_stark , the incumbent , as the candidate for president of the city_council and mr._beame , who live in brooklyn , to replace mr._gerosa as the candidate for controller . 
the mayor speak yesterday at the united irish counties feis on the hunter_college_campus in the_bronx . 
after his speech , reporters ask him about the report of his political intentions , publish in yesterday 's new_york times . 
the mayor say : 
`` it did n't come from me . 
but as i have say before , if i announce my candidacy , i will have something definite to say about running_mates '' . 
a wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rise in massachusetts . 
there be a tangible feeling in_the_air of revulsion toward politics . 
the taxi driver take the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state be `` all_the_same '' . 
`` it 's ' see joe , see jim '' ' , he say . 
`` the hand be out '' . 
a political_scientist write_of the growth of `` alienated voters '' , who `` believe that voting be useless because politicians or those who influence politicians be corrupt , selfish and beyond popular control . 
these voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy , the object of_which be to plunder them '' . 
corruption be hardly_a recent development in the city and state that were widely identify as the locale of edwin_o ' connor 's novel , `` the last hurrah '' . 
but there be reasons for the current spotlight on the subject . 
a succession of highly publicized scandals has arouse the public within the last year . 
graft in the construction of highways and other public_works has bring_on state and federal investigations . 
and the election of president_kennedy has attract new attention to the ethical climate of his home state . 
a reader of the boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery , or worse , be the norm in massachusetts public life . 
day_after_day some new episode is report . 
the state public_works department is accuse of having spend $ 8555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property . 
an assistant attorney_general is direct to investigate . 
congress start another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers . 
in the senate , several bills are expect to pass without any major conflict or opposition . 
in the house , the southern-republican coalition is expect to make another major stand in opposition to the administration 's housing bill , while more jockey is expect in an attempt to advance the aid-to-education bill . 
the housing bill be now in the house_rules_committee . 
it is expect to be report_out tuesday , but this be a_little uncertain . 
the panel 's action depend_on the return of representative_james_w._trimble , democrat of arkansas , who has been side with speaker_sam_rayburn 's forces in the rules_committee in move bills to the floor . 
mr._trimble has be in the hospital but is expect back tuesday . 
the housing bill is expect to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of southern democrats and conservative republicans . 
the democratic leadership , however , hope to pass it sometime this week . 
the $ 6100000000 measure , which was pass last monday by the senate , provide_for forty-year mortgages at low down-payments for moderate-income families . 
it also provide_for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories . 
the education bill appear to be temporarily stall in the rules_committee , where two northern democratic members who usually vote with the administration are balk because of the religious controversy . 
they be james_j._delaney of queens and thomas_p._o ' neill_jr. of massachusetts . 
what could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amend the national_defense_education_act of 1958 . 
this would provide_for long-term federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school facilities for teach science , languages and mathematics . 
mr._delaney and mr._o ' neill be not willing to vote on the public-school measure until the defense education bill clear the house_education and labor_committee . 
about half of all peace_corps projects assign to voluntary agencies will be carry_out by religious groups , according to an official of the corps . 
in the $ 40000000 budget that has been submit for congressional approval , $ 26000000 would be spend through universities and private voluntary agencies . 
twelve projects propose by private groups be at the contract-negotiation stage , gordon_boyce , director of relations with the voluntary agencies , say in a washington interview . 
six of these were propose by religious groups . 
they will be for teaching , agriculture and community development in southeast_asia , africa , the middle_east and latin_america . 
interviews with several church leaders have disclose that this development has raise the question whether the peace_corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods , means and goals . 
there be a_number_of ways this could happen , the churchmen point_out , and here be an example : 
last month in ghana an american missionary discover when he came_to pay his hotel_bill that the usual rate had been double . 
when he protest , the hotel owner say : 
`` why do you worry ? 
the u._s._government is pay for it . 
the u._s._government pay for all its overseas workers '' . 
`` i do n't work for the government '' , the american say . 
`` i be a missionary '' . 
the hotel owner shrug . 
`` same thing '' , he say . 
and_then , some churchmen remark , there be a more classical church-state problem : 
can religious agencies use government funds and peace_corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state ? 
r._sargent_shriver_jr. , director of the corps , be certain that they can . 
no religious group , he declare in an interview , will receive peace_corps funds unless it forswear all proselytizing on the project it propose . 
at a gay party in the kremlin for president_sukarno of indonesia , premier_khrushchev pull_out his pockets and say , beam : `` look , he take everything i have '' ! 
mr._khrushchev was jest in the expansive mood of the successful banker . 
indonesia be one of the twenty under-developed countries of asia , africa and latin_america that are receive soviet aid . 
the soviet_union and other members of the communist bloc are rapidly expand their economic , technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations . 
the communist countries allocate more_than $ 1000000000 in economic aid alone last year , according to western estimates . 
this be the biggest annual outlay since the communist program for the under-developed countries make its modest beginning in 1954 . 
in 1960 more_than 6000 communist technicians be present in those countries . 
a committee of experts has recommend that a country 's population be consider in the distribution of professional posts at the united_nations . 
this was disclose today by a responsible source amid intensify efforts by the soviet_union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the united_nations . 
one effect of the proposal , which put a premium on population instead of economic strength , as in_the_past , would be to take jobs from european_nations and give more to such countries as india . 
india be the_most populous united_nations member with more_than 400000000 inhabitants . 
the new formula for filling staff positions in the secretariat be one of a_number_of recommendations make by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report . 
the report was complete after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of the organization of the united_nations . 
the advisory_committee on administrative and budgetary questions is expect to receive the report this week . 
the jobs formula be understood to follow these lines : 
each of the organization 's ninety-nine members would get two professional posts , such_as political affairs officer , a department_head or an economist , to start . 
each member would get one post for each 10000000 people in its population up_to 150000000 people or a maximum of fifteen posts . 
each member with a population above 150000000 would get one additional post for each additional 30000000 people up_to an unspecified cut-off point . 
the three leaders of laos agree today to begin negotiations tomorrow on form a coalition government that would unite the war-ridden kingdom . 
the decision was make in zurich by prince_boun_oum , premier of the pro-western royal government ; prince_souvanna_phouma , leader of the nation 's neutralists and recognize as premier by the communist bloc , and prince_souphanouvong , head of the pro-communist pathet_lao forces . 
the latter two be half-brothers . 
their joint statement was welcome by the western delegations who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth plenary session of the fourteen-nation conference on the future of laos . 
an agreement among the princes on a coalition government would ease their task , diplomats concede . 
but no one be overly optimistic . 
w._averell_harriman of the united_states , malcolm_macdonald of britain , maurice_couve de murville , france 's foreign_minister , and howard_c._green , canada 's minister of external affairs , conclude , meanwhile , a round of consultations here on future tactics in the conference . 
the pace of the talks has slow with each passing week . 
princess_moune , prince_souvanna_phouma 's young daughter , read the princes ' statement . 
they have a two-hour luncheon together in `` an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation '' , she say . 
the three laotians agree upon a six-point agenda for their talks , which are to last three days . 
the princess say it was too early to say what would be decide if no agreement was reach after three days . 
the meetings in zurich , the statement say , would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition government .

thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erect along pennsylvania_avenue between the capitol and the white_house for the big inaugural parade on jan. 20 . 
assume the weather be halfway decent that day , hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as president_john_f._kennedy and retiring president_dwight_d._eisenhower leave capitol_hill following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route . 
pennsylvania_avenue , name for one of the original 13 states , perhaps be not the_most impressive street in the district_of_columbia from a commercial standpoint . 
but from a historic viewpoint none can approach it . 
within view of the avenue be some of the united_states_government 's tremendous buildings , plus shrines and monuments . 
of_course , 1600 pennsylvania , the white_house , be the_most famous address of the free_world . 
within an easy walk from capitol_hill where pennsylvania_avenue come together with constitution_avenue , begin a series of great federal buildings , some a block long and all about seven-stories high . 
great chapters of history have been record along the avenue , now about 169 years old . 
in the early spring of 1913 a_few hundred_thousand persons turn_out to watch 5000 women parade . 
they be the suffragettes and they want to vote . 
in the 1920 presidential election they have that right and many_of them did vote for_the_first_time . 
along this avenue which see marching soldiers from the war_between_the_states return in 1865 be the national archives building where hundreds of thousands of_this country 's most valuable records are keep . 
also the department_of_justice building is locate where j._edgar_hoover preside over the federal bureau of investigation . 
street car tracks run down the center of pennsylvania , power with lines that be underground . 
many spectators will be occupy seats and vantage_points border lafayette_square , opposite the white_house . 
in_this historic square be several statutes , but the one that stand_out over the others be that of gen._andrew_jackson , hero of the battle of new_orleans . 
move past the presidential viewing stand and lafayette_square will be at_least 40 marching units . 
about 16000 military members of all branches of the armed_forces will take_part in the parade . 
division one of the parade will be the service academies .

what does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in mississippi ? 
even for those who have been observe the political scene a long_time , no script from the past be worth very_much in gaze into the state 's immediate political future . 
this is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operate the helm of the state_government and be the elected leader of its two million inhabitants - gov._ross_barnett . 
barnett , who come into office with no previous experience in_public administration , has surround himself with confusion which not_only keep his foes guess but his friends as_well . 
consequently , it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the barnett administration will take in the coming year . 
some predict the administration will settle_down during 1961 and iron_out the rough edges which it has have thus_far . 
the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus_far has be the steady stream of job-seekers and_others who feel they were give commitments by barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor 's office . 
there be many who predict that should barnett decide to call the legislature back into special session , it will really throw his administration into a scramble . 
certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come_back together barnett will be_able_to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful `` honeymoon '' he have in the 1960 legislative session . 
if barnett does n't call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the legislature has not meet in regular or special session . 
the odds favor a special session , more_than likely early in the year . 
legislators always get restless for a special session ( whether for the companionship or the $ 22.50 per_diem be not certain ) and if they start agitate . 
barnett is not expect to be able to withstand the pressure . 
the issue which may make it necessary to have a session be the highly_sensitive problem of cut the state 's congressional_districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat . 
with eyes focus_on the third congressional_district , the historic delta district , and congressman_frank_e._smith as the one most likely to go , the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the delta have hold in the legislature . 
mississippi 's relations with the national democratic_party will be at a crossroads during 1961 , with the first democratic president in eight years in the white_house . 
split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents , the democratic_party in mississippi be currently a wreck . 
and there has be no effort since the election to pull it back together . 
barnett , as the titular head of the democratic_party , apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national democratic_party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary . 
with a democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to mississippi if it had hold its democratic solidarity in the november election . 
now , the picture be clouded , and even us sens._james_o._eastland and john_c._stennis , who remain loyal to the ticket , be uncertain of their status . 
reports be that it be more_than probability that the four congressmen from mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be strip of the usual patronage which flow to congressmen . 
the gov._jimmie_h._davis administration appear to face a difficult year in 1961 , with the governor 's theme of peace and harmony subject to severe stresses . 
the year will probably start_out with segregation still the_most troublesome issue . 
but it might give_way shortly to another vexing issue - that of finances in state_government . 
the transition from segregation to finances might already be in_progress , in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales_tax from 2 per_cent to 3 per_cent . 
the administration has say the sales_tax proposal be merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicate to a grant in aid program . 
but the tardiness of the administration in make the dedication has cause legislators to suspect the tax_bill was relate more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation . 
indeed , the administration 's curious position on the sales_tax be a major factor in contribute to its defeat . 
the administration could not say why $ 28 million was need for a grant-in-aid program . 
the effectiveness of the governor in clear_up some of the inconsistencies revolve_about the sales_tax bill may play a part in determine whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote . 
the tax_bill will be up for reconsideration wednesday in the house when the legislature reconvene . 
davis may use the tax_bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the legislature to normalcy . 
if it fail to pass , he can throw up his hands and say the legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration . 
he could terminate special sessions of the legislature . 
actually , davis would have to toss_in_the_towel soon anyway . 
many legislators be already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token integration . 
this be not the sort_of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly . 
they would like to convey the notion something is being do , even_though it be something they know to be ineffectual . 
passage of the sales_tax measure would also give davis the means to effect a transition . 
he could tell the legislature they had provide the needed funds to carry_on the battle . 
then he could tell them to go_home , while the administration continue to wage the battle with the $ 28 million in extra revenues the sales_tax measure would bring_in over an eight months period . 
it be difficult to be certain how the administration view that $ 28 million , since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one . 
but if the administration should find it does not need the $ 28 million for a grant-in-aid program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very_well seek a way to use the money for other purposes . 
this would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration - the shortage of cash . 
it could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal_year . 
if the administration does not succeed in pass the sales_tax bill , or any other tax_bill , it could very_well be face this spring at the fiscal session of the legislature with an interesting dilemma . 
since the constitution forbid introduction of a tax_bill at a fiscal session , the administration will either have to cut_down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues . 
in either case , it could call a special session of the legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raise additional revenues through a tax raiser . 
the prospect of cut_back spending be an unpleasant one for any governor . 
it be one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem . 
but if all alternatives should be clearly block_off , it can be expect the davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state legislature . 
this might be do to arouse those who have been squeeze_out by the trims to exert pressure on the legislature , so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year . 
a constant problem confront davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not try to economize . 
any tax_bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been use their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves . 
the new_year might see some house-cleaning , either genuine or token , depend_upon developments , to give davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms . 
city_controller_alexander_hemphill charge tuesday that the bids on the frankford_elevated repair project were rig to the advantage of a private contracting company which have `` an inside track '' with the city . 
estimates of the city 's loss in the $ 344000 job have range as high as $ 200000 . 
hemphill say that the hughes_steel_erection_co. contract to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that be far less_than the `` legitimate '' bids of competing contractors . 
the hughes concern then took `` shortcuts '' on the project but got pay anyway , hemphill say . 
the controller 's charge of rigging be the latest development in an investigation which also bring these disclosures tuesday : 
the city has sue for the full amount of the $ 172400 performance_bond cover the contract . 
the philadelphia_transportation_co. is investigate the part its organization play in review the project . 
the signature of harold_v._varani , former director of architecture and engineering in the department of public_property , appear on payment vouchers certify work on the project . 
varani has been fire on charges of accept gifts from the contractor . 
managing_director donald_c._wagner has agree to cooperate fully with hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the_matter . 
the announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance_bond was made by city_solicitor_david_berger at a press_conference following a meeting in the morning with wagner and other officials of the city and the ptc as_well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pull_off the el project before its completion in 1959 . 
the hughes company and the consolidated industries , inc. , both of 3646 n. 2 d st. , file for reorganization under the federal bankruptcy law . 
on monday , the hughes concern was formally declare bankrupt after its directors indicate they could not draw_up a plan for reorganization . 
business_relations between the companies and city have be under investigation by hemphill and district_attorney james_c._crumlish , jr. . 
the suit was file later in the day in common pleas court 7 against the hughes company and two bonding firms . 
travelers_indemnity_co. and the continental_casualty_co. . 
at berger 's direction , the city also intervene in the hughes bankruptcy case in u._s._district_court in a move preliminary to file a claim there . 
`` i am take the position that the contract was clearly violate '' , berger say . 
the contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the el track . 
the contract call_for overhauling of 102 joints . 
the city pay for work on 75 , of_which no_more_than 21 were repair , hemphill charge . 
hemphill say the hughes concern contract to do the repairs at a cost of $ 500 for each joint . 
the bid from a._belanger and sons of cambridge , mass. , which list the same officers as hughes , be $ 600 per joint . 
but , hemphill add , bids from other contractors range from $ 2400 to $ 3100 per joint . 
berger 's decision to sue for the full amount of the performance_bond was question by wagner in the morning press_conference . 
wagner say the city pay only $ 37500 to the hughes company . 
`` we won n't know the full amount until we get a full report '' , wagner say . 
`` we can claim on the maximum amount of the bond '' , berger say . 
wagner reply , `` ca n't you just see the headline : 
' city hook for $ 172000 '' ' ? 
berger insist that `` we know enough to sue for the full amount '' . 
douglas_m._pratt , president of the ptc , who attend the meeting , say the transit company is review the work on the el . 
`` we want to find_out who know about it '' , pratt say . 
`` certain people must have know about it '' . 
`` the ptc is investigate the whole matter '' , pratt say . 
samuel_d._goodis , represent the philadelphia_hotel_association , object on tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing_fees , say that occupancy_rates in major hotels here range from 48 to 74 percent last year . 
goodis voice his objection before city_council 's finance_committee .

howard_e._simpson , the railroad 's president , say , `` a drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitate this regrettable action '' . 
the reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in_which the b. + o. operate . 
it will be accomplish in_two_ways : 
a flat reduction of 10 per_cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belong_to unions . 
there be about 3325 officers and employees in_this class . 
sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring_about a 10 per_cent cut in the union payroll expense . 
since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union_members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by place some of the men on furlough , a b. + o. spokesman say . 
those union_members keep on their jobs , therefore , will not take a cut in their wages .

the proposal was make by dr._david_s._jenkins after he and mrs._d._ellwood_williams , jr. , a board_member and long-time critic of the superintendent , argue for about fifteen minutes at this week 's meeting . 
the disagreement be over what dr._jenkins had say at a previous session and_how his remarks appear in the minutes present at the following meeting . 
mrs._williams have a list which she say contain about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of dr._jenkins 's conversation and_how they were write up for the board 's approval . 
`` i hate to have these things come_up again_and_again '' , dr._jenkins comment as he make his suggestion . 
`` these be the board 's minutes . 
i 'll write what you tell me to '' .

it be a killer sub - that_is , a hunter of enemy subs . 
it have a hull pattern on_that of the united_states navy 's nautilus , the world 's first atomic submarine . 
its power_unit , however , was derive from the reactor of the more modern american nuclear submarine skipjack . 
the announcement that the secrets of the dreadnought had been steal was made in bow_st. police_court here at the end of a three day hearing . 
a full trial was order for : 
two british civil_servants , miss_ethel gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , harry_houghton , 55 , and divorced . 
they are accuse of whisk secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they keep_guard .

[ in washington , the federal_bureau of investigation identify the krogers as morris and lola_cohen , an american couple formerly of new_york_city . ] 
in their suburban cottage the crown charge , the krogers receive secrets from the mystery man , usually on the first saturday evening of each_month , and spend much of the week-end get_off the secrets off to moscow , either on a powerful transmitter bury under the kitchen floor or as dots post over period marks in used books .

just how many sub secrets were being hand_over when the ring , watch for six months , was break remain untold . 
the_british defending lawyers , who today increase from three to four , demand to know if they could make the information involve seem of little value to a jury , the chances of their clients would improve .

the atom reactor , water cool , be the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic_energy commission and westinghouse_electric_corp. . 
thru development , the reactor and its steam_turbines had been reduce greatly in size , and also in complexity , allow a single propeller to be use , the navy say . 
the hull be also a result of almost a decade of work . 
it was first try_out on a conventional submarine , the albacore , in 1954 . 
the skipjack become the fastest submarine ever build . 
reputedly it could outrun , underwater , the fastest destroyers . 
it could , reputedly , go 70000 miles without refuel and stay down more_than a month . 
it be of the hunter-killer type , design to seek_out ships and other submarines with its most advance gear and destroy them with torpedoes . 
the navy captain disclose also that a list of questions find in miss gee 's purse would , if complete and hand back , have give the kremlin a complete picture `` of our current anti-submarine effort and would have show what we are do in research and development for the future '' .

the world_war 2 , german bomber roll down a runway and take_off . 
the only way fiedler could get_back to earth alive be to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip .

it be time to go_up myself '' . 
fiedler be then technical director of hitler 's super-secret `` reichenberg project '' , which remain unknown to the allies until after the war .

the target be allied shipping - a desperate effort to stave_off the allied invasion of europe . 
the success of the project depend_upon fiedler 's flight . 
squeezed into the few cubic_feet normally filled by the rocket 's automatic guidance mechanism , the scientist wait while the bomber gain altitude . 
at 12000 feet , fiedler signal `` release '' , and start the roaring pulse-jet engine - then streak away from beneath the heinkel . 
to the german pilot in the bomber the rocket become a faint black speck , hurtle through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m. p. h. . 
it be probably man 's first successful flight in a missile . 
`` she fly beautifully '' , say fiedler . 
`` there be only one power control - a valve to adjust the fuel flow . 
i have exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip '' . 
use a steering_system that control the modified rocket 's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons , fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage . 
he manage to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m. p. h. - fast even for a modern jet_plane touchdown - and bank into the airfield . 
moments later the v-1 skim across the landing_strip , edge closer and closer to a touchdown - then in a streamer of dust it land . 
fiedler go_on to make several other test flights before german pilots take_over the reichenberg missiles . 
the missiles be to be arm with an underwater bomb . 
pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water , strike below the waterline of individual ships . 
a crack corps of 50 pilots was form from the ranks of volunteers , but the project was halt before the end of the war , and the missiles later fall_into allied hands . 
now a family_man with three children , fiedler live in a quiet residential area near the lockheed plant at sunnyvale .

probably the hottest thing that has hit the dallas investment community in years be the morton foods_stock issue , which was sell to the public during the past week . 
for many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the dallas-headquartered company be tremendous . 
it be not a case of the investment_bankers having to sell the stock ; it be more one of allot a_few shares to a_number_of customers and explain to others why they have no_more to sell . 
investors who want 100 shares in many cases end_up with 25 , and customers who had put_in a bid to buy 400 shares find themselves with 100 and count themselves lucky to get that many . 
in_fact , very_few customers , anywhere in the nation , be able to get more_than 100 shares . 
some dallas investment firms get only 100 shares , for all_of their customers . 
a measure of how hot the stock be , can be find in_what happen to it on the market as soon as trading begin . 
the stock was sell in the underwriting at a price of $ 12.50 a share . 
the first over-the-counter trade wednesday afternoon at eppler , guerin + turner , the manage underwriter , be at $ 17 a share . 
and from_that the stock move_up right_on up until it was trade thursday morning at around $ 22 a share . 
but the morton foods issue be hot long before it be on the market . 
indeed , from the moment the reports of the coming issue first start circulate in dallas last january , the inquiries and demand for the stock start build_up . 
letters by the reams come_in from investment firms all_over the nation , all_of them want to get a part of the shares that would be sell ( 185000 to the public at $ 12.50 , with another 5000 reserve for morton foods employes at $ 11.50 a share ) . 
there be even a cable in french from a bank in switzerland that had somehow learn about the dallas stock offering . 
`` we subscribe 500 shares of morton foods of texas . 
cable confirmation '' , it say translate . 
but e._g._t. could not let the_swiss bank have even 10 shares . 
after it allot shares to 41 underwriters and 52 sell group members from coast to coast there be not_many shares for anyone . 
but the result of_it all be , e._g._t. partner dean_guerin believe , an effective distribution of the stock to owners all_over the nation . 
`` i feel confident the stock will qualify for the ' national list '' ' , he say , mean its market_price would be quote regularly in newspapers all_over the country . 
he be also pleased with the wide distribution because he think it prove again his argument that dallas investment men can do just_as good a job as the big new_york investment_bankers claim only they can do . 
but what make the morton foods_stock issue such a hot one ? 
the answer be that it be a combination of circumstances . 
first , the general stock_market has been boiling upward for the last few months , drive stocks of all kinds up . 
as a result , it be not easy to find a stock price as the morton issue was price ( at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings , to yield a_little over 5 per_cent on the 64 c anticipated dividend ) . 
second , the `` potato_chip industry '' has catch the fancy of investors lately , and until morton foods come_along there be only two potato_chip stocks - frito and h._w._lay - on the market . 
both of those have have dynamic run-ups in price on the market in recent months , both were sell at higher price-earnings and yield bases than morton was come to market at , and everyone who know anything about it expect the morton stock to have a fast run-up . 
and third , the potato_chip industry has take_on the flavor of a `` growth '' industry in the public mind of_late . 
foods , which long had been consider `` recession resistant '' but hardly dynamic stocks , have been act like growth_stocks , go_to higher price-earnings ratios . 
the potato_chip industry these days is grow , not_only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience_foods , but also because of a combination of circumstances that has lead to growth by merger . 
the history of the u._s. potato_chip industry be that many_of today 's successful companies get_started during the deep depression days . 
those that remain be those that were head by strong executives , men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival_of_the_fittest . 
but today many_of those men are reach retirement age and suddenly realize that they face an estate_tax problem with their closely hold companies and also that they have no second-echelon management in their firms . 
so they go look_for mergers with other firms that have publicly quote stock , and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like frito . 
all those things combine to make the morton foods_stock the hot_issue that it be and be . 
now , if morton 's newest product , a corn_chip known as chip-o 's , turn_out to sell as_well as its stock did , the stock may turn_out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up_to .

the unsatisfactory 1958 - 60 expansion , he say , be not_due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic_policies combine with retrenching decisions result from the steel strike .

`` consumer uncertain about economic_conditions '' . 
this be the chief reason for a so-so sales outlook give by two-thirds of 56 builders poll by the national_housing_center . 
other reasons mention by one-third or more of the builders be `` resistance to high interest_rates , cost advantage of buy over rent has narrow , shelter market near saturation and prospects unable to qualify '' . 
the poll was taken at the center 's annual builders ' intentions conference . 
it disclose that the builders : 
expect their own production volume , and presumably sales , to jump 30 percent in 1961 . 
look_for home building nationally to advance less_than 10 percent this year from 1960 's 1257700 0 non-farm housing starts . 
the industry has say 1960 be a poor year . 
starts be down 20 percent from 1959 . 
why the discrepancy between the builders ' forecasts for themselves and for the industry ? 
the reason , say the housing_center , be that the builders invite to the intentions conference `` be generally among the more successful businessmen , and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders '' . 
farm machinery dealer bob_houtz tilt back in a battered chair and tell of a sharp pickup in sales : 
`` we 've sell four corn pickers since labor_day and have good prospects for 10 more . 
we sell only four pickers all last year '' . 
gus_ehlers , competitor of mr._houtz in_this farm community , say his business since august 1 is run 50  above a year earlier . 
`` before then , my sales during much of the year had lag behind 1960 by 20  '' , he say . 
though the sales gains these two dealers are experience be above average for their business , farm equipment sales are climb in most rural_areas . 
paradoxically , the sales rise be_due in large measure to government efforts to slash farm output . 
although the administration 's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 , farmers , with the help of extra fertilizer and good_weather , are get such high yields per acre that many are being force to buy new harvesting machines . 
fields of corn and some other crops in many cases be so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently . 
the higher price_supports provide by the new legislation , together with rising_prices for farm products , are push_up farm income , make it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery . 
seven of the eight companies that turn_out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of august have show gains average nearly 10  above last year . 
`` in august our dealers sell 13  more farm machinery than a year earlier and in september retail sales be 14  higher than last year '' , say mark_v._keeler , farm equipment vice_president of international_harvester_co. . 
for the year to_date , sales of the company 's farm equipment dealers still lag about 5  behind 1960 . 
among individual dealers question in nearly a score of states , two out of three report their sales since august 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier , with the increases range from 5  to 50  . 
not all sections are show an upswing , however ; the drought-seared north_central states be the_most notable exceptions to the uptrend . 
the significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extend beyond the farm equipment industry . 
the demand for farm machinery is regard_as a yardstick of rural buying generally . 
farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products . 
more_than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nation 's trucks , buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home_appliances , chemicals and other products . 
farmers be so eager_for new machinery that they 're haggle less over prices than they did a year ago , dealers report . 
`` farmers are n't as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale '' , say jack_martin , who sell j._i._case tractors and implements in sioux_city , iowa . 
`` this morning , we allow a farmer $ 600 on the old picker he trade_in on a new $ 2700 model . 
last year , we probably would have give him $ 700 for a comparable machine '' . 
mr._martin sell 21 tractors in august ; in august of 1960 , he sell seven . 
with dealer stocks of new equipment average about 25  below a year ago , the affects of the rural recovery are being feel almost immediately by the country 's farm equipment manufacturers . 
for_example , farm equipment shipments of international_harvester in august climb about 5  above a year earlier , mr._keeler report . 
tractor production at massey-ferguson , ltd. , of toronto in july and august rise to 2418 units from 869 in the_like period a year earlier , say john_staiger , vice_president . 
with the lower dealer inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements . 
merritt_d._hill , ford_motor_co. vice_president , say his company is start to get calls daily from dealers demand immediate delivery or want earlier ship dates on orders for corn pickers . 
except for a_few months in late 1960 and early 1961 , retail farm equipment sales have trail year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959 . 
the rise in sales last winter was check when the government 's new feed_grain program was adopt ; the program result in a cutback of around 20  in planted acreage and , as a result , reduce the immediate need for machines . 
nearly all_of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has result chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects . 
total farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129  of the 1947 - 49 average , three points higher than the july_1 estimate and exactly equal_to the final figure for 1960 . 
the government also is aid farmers ' income prospects . 
agriculture_department economists estimate the government this year will hand farmers $ 1.4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments , well above the record $ 1.1 billion of 1958 and about double the $ 639 million of 1960 . 
price_support loans may total another $ 1 billion this year . 
with cash receipts from marketings expect to be slightly above 1960 , farmers ' gross_income is estimate at $ 39.5 billion , $ 1.5 billion above 1960 's record high . 
net_income may reach $ 12.7 billion , up $ 1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953 . 
the government report last week that the index of prices receive by farmers rise in the month end at mid-september for the third consecutive month , reach 242  of the 1910 - 14 average compare with 237  at mid-july . 
kennedy oppose any widespread relief from a high_court depletion ruling . 
the supreme_court decision in mid-1960 be in the case of a company make sewer pipe from clay which it mine . 
the company , in figure its taxable earnings , deduct a percentage of the revenue it receive for its finished products . 
such `` depletion allowances '' , in the form of percentages of sales are authorize by tax law for specified raw_materials producers use_up their assets . 
the high_court hold that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw_materials remove from the ground , not to the revenue from finished products . 
a measure pass by congress just before adjourn soften the ruling 's impact , on prior-year returns still under review , for clay-mining companies that make brick and tile products . 
the measure allow such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50  of the value of the finished products rather_than the lower value of raw clay alone . 
president_kennedy , in sign the relief measure into law , stress he regard it as an exception . 
`` my approval of_this bill should not be view_as establish a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries '' , the president say . 
charitable deductions come_in_for closer scrutiny by the i._r._s. .

in such instance , revenuers stress , the deduction must be reduce by the value of the benefit receive . 
a rule on the federal deductibility of state taxes is contest . 
a realty corporation in louisiana owe no tax under federal law , on its gain from the sale of property dispose of in_line with a plan of liquidation . 
louisiana , however , collect an income_tax on the profits from the sale . 
the corporation , in file its final federal income return , claim the state tax payment as a deductible expense , as permit under u._s. tax law . 
the revenue service disallow the claim , invoke a law provision that generally bar deductions for expenses incur in connection with what it say be tax-exempt income . 
the tax_court reject this view . 
it say the tax-freedom of the gain in_this case stem not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations . 
the tax_court decision and a similar earlier finding by the ninth_circuit court_of_appeals challenge a year-old i._r._s. ruling on the subject . 
the service has not say what its next step will be . 
peace_corps volunteers are assure a tax_benefit under the law create the agency . 
it provide that the $ 1800 termination payment each cadet is to get , after serve a two-year hitch without pay , will be spread over both years , not tax in_its_entirety at a possibly higher rate in the year receive . 
the owner of a public_relations firm owe no income_tax on payments he receive from a client company and `` kick_back '' to the company 's advertising manager , the tax_court rule . 
the taxpayer testify that in_order_to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager . 
the court uphold the taxpayer 's contention that these `` kickbacks '' be not his income though they pass_through his hands . 
the court limit its decision to the tax issue involve , comment : `` it be not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction '' .

hire the wife for one 's company may win her tax-aided retirement income . 
a spouse employ by a corporation her husband control , for_example , may be entitle to distributions under the company 's pension plan as_well as to her own social_security coverage . 
she would be tax on the pensions when receive , of_course , but the company 's contributions would be tax-free . 
a frequent pitfall in_this sort_of arrangement , experts warn , be a tendency to pay the wife more_than her job be worth and to set_aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income . 
in_that event , they note , the revenue service might declare the pension plan be discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law . 
possible upshots : the company could be deny a deduction for its pension payments , or those payments for the wife and other employes could be rule taxable to them in the year make . 
state_briefs : voters in four counties contain and border denver authorize the imposition of an additional 2  sales_tax within that area .

contemporary furniture that_is neither danish nor straight-line modern but have sculptured pattern , many design facets , warmth , dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability . 
that_is the goal of two new collections being introduce in dallas this month .

there 's a_lot_of talk about the problem of education in america today . 
what most people do n't seem to realize , if they are n't tied_up with the thing as i am , be that 90  of the problem be transportation . 
i never dream of the logistical difficulties involved until , at_long_last , both of my boys got squeeze into high_school . 
it seem like only last year that we watch them set_out up the hill hand_in_hand on a rainy_day in their yellow raincoats to fingerpaint at the grammar_school . 
get to and from school be no problem . 
they either walk or were drive . 
now they go_to a high_school that be two miles away . 
one might think the problem would be similar . 
they could walk , ride on a bus or be drive . 
it 's much more complex than that . 
generally , they go_to school with a girl name gloriana , who live down the block , and have a car . 
this be a way of get to school , but , i understand , it entail a certain loss of social_status . 
a young_man does n't like to be drive up in_front of a school in a car drive by a girl who be n't even in a higher class than he be , and be also a girl . 
`` why do n't you walk to school then '' ? 
i suggest . 
`` my father walk , through two miles of snow , in illinois '' . 
`` did you '' ? 
i was ask . 
`` no '' , i say , `` i did n't happen to grow_up in illinois '' . 
i explain , however , that i have my share of hardship in make my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom . 
i had to ride a streetcar two miles . 
sometimes the streetcar be late . 
sometimes there be n't even any seats . 
i had to stand_up , with the ladies . 
sometimes i get_on the wrong car and did n't get to school at_all , but wind_up at the ocean , or some other dismal place , and had_to spend the day there . 
i 've try to compromise by let them take the little car now_and_then . 
when they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car . 
she has to have at_least one car herself . 
i feel a certain loss of status when i am drive up in_front of work in a car drive by my wife , who be only a woman . 
even that be n't satisfactory . 
if they have to take any car , they 'd rather take the big one . 
they say that when they take a car , gloriana does n't take her car , but ride with them . 
but when gloriana ride with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her , so the little car be n't big enough . 
the logic of_that be impeccable , of_course , except that i feel like a fool being drive up_to work in a_little car , by my wife , when everybody know i have a big car and be capable_of driving myself . 
the solution , naturally , be the bus . 
however , it 's a half-mile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus , and it 's too hard on my legs . 
my wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there . 
but that 's hardly realistic . 
nobody walk any_more but crackpots and harry_truman , and he 's already get an education . 
advance publicity on the los_angeles blue_book does not mention names drop as do the notices for the new_york social_register which make news last week .

here 's an idea for a child 's room that be easy to execute and be completely charming , use puppets for lamp bases . 
most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies , and they prefer to see them as though the puppets be in action , rather_than put_away in boxes . 
display as lamps , the puppets delight the children and be decorative accent . 
to create such a lamp , order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop . 
measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket , allow three to four inches above the puppet 's head . 
make_sure that the metal tube through which the wire pass be in the shape of an inverted `` l '' , the foot of the `` l '' about three inches long , so_that the puppet can hang directly under the light . 
use the strings that manipulate the puppet , suspend him from the light fixture by tie the strings to the lamp base . 
in_this_way , you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position , with feet , or one foot , barely rest_on the pedestal . 
if the puppets be of uniform size , you can change them in_accord with your child 's whims . 
although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be change without disharmony , it be far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a child 's playtime . 
those illustrate be reminiscent_of a circus top or a merry-go-round . 
the scalloped edge be particularly appealing . 
today 's trend toward furniture designs from america 's past is teach home-owners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our colonial era . 
a generation ago there be plenty of people who appreciate antiques and fine reproductions . 
in the background lurk the feeling , however , that these pieces , beautiful as they be , lack the utilitarian touch . 
so junior 's bedroom was usually trick_out with heavy , nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the `` hard knocks '' , while the fine secretary was relegate to the parlor where it be for show only . 
this be n't true of the many homemakers of the 1960 's , accord to decorator consultant , leland_alden . 
housewives are find literally hundreds of ways of get the maximum use out of traditional designs , say mr._alden and they are do it largely because colonial craftsmen have `` an innate sense of the practical '' . 
there be a_number_of reasons why the eighteenth_century designer had to develop `` down to earth '' designs - or go out of business . 
hotel_escape 's bonanza room have a real bonanza in its new attraction , the versatile `` kings 4 , plus two '' . 
this be the strongest act to hit the area in a long while - a well integrated , fast moving outfit specialize in skits , vocals , comedy and instrumentals all_of it distinctly display the pro touch . 
show spotlight the kings - george_worth , bill_kay , frank_ciciulla and gene_wilson , flank by dave_grossman and ron_stevens . 
the plus two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet cover the stage with a batch of instruments range from tuba to tambourine , and the beat be solid . 
in the comedy division , the kings simply augment talent and imagination with a_few props . 
net result be some crazy-wonderful nonsense , part of_which can be class as pure slapstick . 
kings 4 , have rate as a popular act in vegas and western nightclubs . 
if they can n't chalk_up big business here then let 's stop this noise about how hip we be , and stick_to our community singing .

al has add some sidemen to the act which make_for a smoother operation but it 's substantially the same format hear last spring . 
newcomers be ernie_kemm on piano , wes_robbins , bass and trumpet , and jack_kelly on drums . 
it 's a solid show but , except for some interim keyboarding by ernie , it 's al 's all_the_way . 
maestro 's biggest stock in trade be his personality , and ability to establish a warm rapport with his audience . 
he skip around from jazz , to blues to boogie - accompany himself on piano and frequently pull_in the customers in on the act . 
this be a bouncy show which may get a_little too frantic at_times , but be nevertheless worth your appraisal .

be there anything a frustrated individual can do about communism 's growing threat on our doorstep and around the world ?

at_that_time the second_half of the christian_youth_crusade against communism will be stage . 
a young real_estate salesman , kern first get seriously interest in the problems pose by communism when in the navy air_force . 
he was particularly strike by a course on communist brainwashing . 
kern begin read a_lot about the history and philosophy of communism , but never feel there be anything he , as an individual , could do about it . 
when he attend the christian_anti-communist_crusade school here about six months ago , jim become convince that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set_out to do it . 
the best approach , he figure , be to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at_first presbyterian_church .

but after_that service , they decide to try to let the girls say grace at the table , have bedtime prayers , and bible stories .

enrique_jorda , conductor and musical director of the san_francisco symphony , will fulfill two more guest conducting engagements in europe before return home to open the symphony 's golden_anniversary season , it was announce . 
the guest assignments are schedule for november 14 and 18 , with the orchestra_sinfonica_siciliana in palermo and the orchestra of radio_cologne . 
the season in san_francisco will open with a special gala_concert on november 22 .

the leningrad_kirov_ballet , which open a series of performances friday night at the opera_house , be , i think , the finest `` classical '' ballet_company i have ever see , and the production of the petipa-tschaikowsky `` sleeping_beauty '' with which it begin the series be incomparably the finest i have ever have the pleasure of witness . 
this work be no favorite of mine . 
i be prepared to demonstrate at an ytime that it represent the spirit of imperial_russia in its most vulgar , infantile , and reactionary aspect ; that its persistent use by ballet_companies of the soviet regime indicate that that old spirit be just_as stultifying alive today as it ever be ; that its presentation in_this country be part of a capitalist plot to boobify the american people ; that its choreography be undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms . 
all_of this be true and all_of it be totally meaningless in the face of the kirov 's utterly captivating presentation . 
the reasons for this enchantment be numerous , but most_of them end in `` ova '' , `` eva '' , or `` aya '' . 
in_other_words , no merely male creature can resist that corps_de_ballet . 
it seem to have been choose exclusively from the winners of beauty contests - miss_omsk , miss_pinsk , miss_stalingr - oops , skip it . 
these qualities alone , however , would not account_for their success , and it take me a while to discover the crowning virtue that complete this company 's collective personality . 
it be a kind_of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been lead to believe be peculiar_to the american ballet . 
that convention of russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they be all the daughters of impoverished grand_dukes drive to thestage out of filial piety , be totally absent from the kirov . 
this be all the more remarkable because the kirov be to ballet what senator_goldwater be to american politics . 
but , obviously , at_least some things have change for the better in russia so_far as the ballet be concerned .

famed cellist pablo_casals take his instrument to the east_room of the white_house yesterday and charm the staff with a two-hour rehearsal . 
he was get the feel of the room for a concert tomorrow night for puerto_rico governor_luis_munoz_marin . 
president_kennedy 's invitation to the spanish-born master say , `` we feel your performance as one of the world 's greatest artists would lend distinction to the entertainment of our guests '' . 
for a good many seasons i 've been look at the naughty stuff on television , so the other night i think i ought to see how immorality is do on the other side of the fence in movies . 
after_all , this year 's movies be next year 's television_shows . 
so i go to see `` la_dolce_vita '' . 
it has been bill as a towering monument to immorality . 
all the sins of ancient rome are say to be collect into this three-hour film . 
if that 's all the romans do , it 's a surprise to me that rome fall . 
after television , `` la_dolce_vita '' seem as harmless as a gray_line tour of north_beach at night . 
i cannot imagine a single scene that_is n't do in a far naughtier manner on tv every_week . 
i believe tv watchers will be bore . 
`` la_dolce_vita '' have none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average tv western . 
week in , week out , there be more sex to be see in `` the adventures of ozzie and harriet '' . 
there be more decadence on `` 77 sunset_strip '' . 
there be more obvious nymphomaniacs on any private-eye series . 
in another respect , television viewers will feel right at_home because most_of the actors be unknowns . 
with the exception of lex_barker and anita_ekberg , the credits be as unfamiliar as you 'll find on the robert_herridge_theater . 
most_of the emphasis has been place on a `` wild party '' at a seaside villa . 
producer fellini should have look at some of the old silent films where they really have parties ! 
the dolce_vita get-together boast a strip tease ( carry as far as a black slip ) ; a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carry the hero around on her back while he throw pillow feathers in her face ; a frigid beauty , and three silly fairies . 
put them all_together and they spell the only four-letter word i can think_of : dull . 
apparently fellini catch the crowd when its parties had begin to pall . 
what a swinging group they must have be when they first start entertaining ! 
as a moral shocker it be a dud . 
but this does n't detract from its merit as an interesting , if_not great , film . 
the chronicle 's paine_knickerbocker sum_up it up neatly : 
`` this be a long picture and a controversial one , but basically it be a moral , enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps rome has from her traditional political , cultural and religious glories '' . 
and when they sell it to television in a_couple_of years , it can be show without editing .

`` i be an art major in college '' , miss_baldrige explain . 
`` i 've be here so many_times i could n't count them '' .

they notice roman_buildings in the background of raphael 's `` alba_madonna '' and `` texture '' in a monet painting of rheims_cathedral . 
everybody had hear of van_gogh , the_french impressionist .

perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital . 
but to the families it serve , their help cannot be measure . 
family_service could not open its doors to a single family without the financial support of the united_givers_fund . 
anticipated heavy traffic along the skyline_drive fail to materialize yesterday , park rangers say , and those who make the trip get a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies sweep clear of haze . 
one of the initial questions put to president_kennedy at his first news_conference last january be about his attitude toward a meeting with premier_khrushchev . 
mr._kennedy reply : 
`` i be hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground '' . 
the president know that a confrontation with mr._khrushchev sooner_or_later probably be inevitable and even desirable . 
but he was convince that the realities of power - military , economic and ideological - be the decisive_factors in the struggle with the communists and that these could not be talk away at a heads of government meeting . 
he wanted to buy_time to strengthen the u._s. and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign_policy . 
last friday the white_house announce : 
president_kennedy will meet with soviet premier_nikita_s._khrushchev in vienna_june 3 and 4 . 
the announcement come_after a period of sharp deterioration in east-west relations . 
the heightened tension , in_fact , had be a major factor in the president 's change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the soviet leader . 
he was not go_to vienna to negotiate - the simultaneous announcements in washington and moscow last week stress that no formal negotiations were plan . 
but mr._kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with mr._khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe . 
that objective set the high stakes and drama of the vienna meeting . 
despite efforts by washington last week to play_down the significance of the meeting , it clearly was go to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold_war . 
the u._s. and soviet heads of government have meet three_times since sir_winston_churchill in 1953 introduce a new word into international diplomacy with his call_for a fresh approach to the problem of peace `` at the summit of the nations '' . 
the first time be in 1955 when a full-dress big four summit_meeting produce the `` spirit of geneva '' . 
the spirit serve chiefly to lull the west while moscow make inroads into the middle_east . 
in 1959 president_eisenhower and premier_khrushchev hold an informal session in the u._s. . 
that meeting produce the `` spirit of camp_david '' - a spirit , it later turn_out , that mask a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a berlin settlement . 
on the third occasion - another big four summit session at paris a year ago - there be no problem of an illusory `` spirit '' . 
premier_khrushchev wreck the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the u._s. for the u-2 incident . 
the episode tend to confirm the u._s. belief that propaganda , the hope of one-sided concessions , and the chance to split the allies , rather_than genuine negotiation , be the soviet leader 's real aims in summitry . 
thus when premier_khrushchev intimate even before inauguration that he hope for an early meeting with the new president , mr._kennedy was confront with a delicate problem . 
shortly before his nomination he had set_forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the soviet leader in these words : 
`` as long as mr._khrushchev be convinced that the balance of world_power is shift his way , no amount of either smiles or toughness , neither camp_david talks nor kitchen debates , can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations '' . 
the president had set for himself the task , which he believe vital , of awaken the u._s. and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance . 
he did not want the effort weaken by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary . 
he want time , too , to review the united_states ' global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherit and new ones he was formulate . 
above_all , he did not want to appear to be run hat in_hand to premier_khrushchev 's doorstep . 
at_the_same_time the president take_pains not to rule_out an eventual meeting with the soviet leader . 
ideally , he know , it should be precede by concrete progress at lower levels . 
but mr._kennedy see value even in an informal meeting , provide that undue hopes were not raise in connection with_it . 
it would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold_war , to try to probe mr._khrushchev 's intentions and to make clear his own views . 
moreover , an eventual meeting be desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the u._s. be not inflexible and was spare no effort to ease international tensions . 
both elements - the caution about a meeting , the willingness eventually to hold one - were reflect in a letter from the president which ambassador_llewellyn_e._thompson bring back to russia late in february . 
the letter , date feb. 22 , was deliver to premier_khrushchev in novosibirsk , siberia , on march 9 . 
it deal mainly with a broad range of east-west issues . 
but it also briefly suggest the possibility of a meeting with mr._khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate be favorable and schedules permit . 
developments over the next two months , however , cause the president to reconsider the question of the timing . 
there be intense discussions in the inner councils of the white_house about the advisability of an early meeting , not because the international climate was improve , but precisely because it was deteriorate alarmingly . 
the president be especially concern about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at geneva . 
the deadlock has been cause by the russians ' new demand for a three-man ( east , west and neutral ) directorate , and thus a veto , over the control machinery . 
in the u._s. , strong pressures have been build_up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the russians may be secretly testing . 
mr._kennedy be less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a geneva breakdown , or even continued stalemate , would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear_weapons to other countries as_well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament . 
there be reason to believe that premier_khrushchev was also concern about a possible spread of nuclear_weapons , particularly to communist_china . 
the question arise as to whether a frank discussion of_that danger with the soviet leader had not become urgent . 
moreover , moscow appear determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies , include the u._n._secretariat and the international_control_commission for laos . 
mr._kennedy was convince that insistence on the demand would make international agreements , or even negotiations , impossible . 
developments in cuba and laos also suggest the advisability of an early summit_meeting . 
initially the white_house reaction be that the bitter exchanges with moscow over cuba and the conflict in laos had dampen prospects for a meeting . 
at_the_same_time , there be increased reason for a quick meeting lest the soviet leader , as a result of those episodes , come_to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the west 's ability and determination to resist communist pressure . 
in cuba , the u._s. had blunder badly and create the impression of impotency against communist penetration even on its own doorstep . 
in laos , the picture be almost equally bad . 
u._s. willingness to accept a neutral laos may have lead premier_khrushchev to believe that other areas could be `` neutralize '' on soviet terms . 
beyond that , allied disagreement about military intervention in laos - despite warnings that they might do so - allow moscow to carry_out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthen the pro-communist forces . 
as a result , the west be in a poor bargaining position at the current geneva negotiations on laos , and south_vietnam and other nations in southeast_asia be under increased pressure . 
in the light of those events , there appear to be a real danger that premier_khrushchev might overreach himself . 
ambassador_thompson report from moscow that the soviet leader 's mood be cocky and aggressive . 
he has indicate that he plan new moves on berlin before the year be out . 
the president and his advisers feel that the time might have come to warn premier_khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such_as berlin , iran or latin_america from which there would be no turn_back . 
it be in_the_midst of such white_house deliberations that premier_khrushchev on may 4 make new inquiries through the u._s._embassy in moscow about a meeting with the president in the near future . 
mr._kennedy tell moscow he would give his answer by may 20 after consultation with the allies . 
the response from london , paris and bonn be favorable . 
firm arrangements for the meeting in vienna were work_out in a final exchange between moscow and washington last week . 
apparently at the insistence of the u._s. , the simultaneous announcements issue in washington and moscow last friday emphasize the `` informal '' nature of the meeting . 
the washington announcement say : 
`` the president and chairman_khrushchev understand that this meeting be not for_the_purpose_of negotiate or reach agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries . 
the meeting will , however , afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries '' . 
the vienna meeting will bring_together a seasoned , 67 - year-old veteran of the cold_war who , in mr._kennedy 's own words , be `` shrewd , tough , vigorous , well-informed and confident '' , and a 44 - year-old president ( his birthday be may 29 ) with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy . 
the announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produce strong reactions in the u._s. of both approval and disapproval . 
the approval did not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreements at vienna . 
the inclination be to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations . 
but those who be in favor of the meeting feel that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size_up one another up would prove salutary . 
mr._khrushchev is know to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men . 
the feeling be that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the president and that plain talk by mr._kennedy would give him pause . 
apart from the personal_equation , another reason advance in favor of the meeting be that too often in_the_past the u._s. appear to have been drag reluctantly to the summit . 
premier_khrushchev has make propaganda capital out of_that fact and in_the_end get his summit_meeting anyway . 
this time the initiative come , in_part at_least , from washington . 
there be also the fact that by the time he meet mr._khrushchev , the president will have complete conversations with all the other principal allied leaders . 
thus he will be in a position to disabuse the soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave allied disunity . 
finally , there be a wide area of agreement on the value of the president 's make a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord . 
there be no single issue that has arouse stronger feelings throughout_the_world . 
if tests are to be resume , the argument go , it be vital that the u._s. make plain that the onus belong_to the soviet_union . 
disapproval of the meeting was base largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse . 
after cuba and laos , it was argue , mr._khrushchev will interpret the president 's consent to the meeting as further evidence of western weakness - perhaps even panic - and be certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believe he hold . 
moreover , the president is meet the soviet leader at_a_time when the administration has still not decide on the scope of america 's firm foreign_policy commitments . 
the question was raise , for_example , as to what attitude the president would take if mr._khrushchev propose a broad neutral belt extend from southeast_asia to the middle_east . 
there be , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that be just too complete and too satisfactory . 
mollusks be a case_in_point . 
the shell , which serve the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tend to cancel_out the possibility of future development . 
though this may or may_not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of american_catholic higher education . 
there can be no_doubt that the american_catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education be most impressive : our european brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . 
the deeper wonder be how this miracle was accomplish in decades , rather_than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that . 
by way of explanation we ourselves be prone to imagine that this achievement stem from the same american_catholic zeal and generosity which bring the parochial_school system into existence . 
there be , however , one curious discrepancy in_this broad and flattering picture . 
view the american_catholic educational achievement in retrospect , we may indeed see it as a unified whole extend from grade_school to university . 
but the simple truth be that higher education has never really be an official american_catholic project ; certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial_school system has be a matter of official policy . 
official encouragement be one thing , but the down-to-earth test be the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds . 
american_catholics have respond generously to bishops ' and pastors ' appeals for the support necessary to create parochial_schools but they have not contribute in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning . 
they have not do so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been make . 
diocesan authorities generally have not regard this as their direct responsibility . 
all_of this may be understandable enough : it be , however , in_fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have act otherwise . 
yet for better or for worse , the truth of the_matter be that most american_catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general catholic support but rather to the initiative , resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities . 
community esprit_de_corps has be the protective shell which has make the achievement possible . 
to understand the past history - and the future potential - of american_catholic higher education , it be necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit d ' corps of the religious community . 
it be something more_than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment . 
a religious community with a vital sense of mission achieve a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom find elsewhere . 
the fact that the group orientation and group identification are_founded on supernatural principles and nourish by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension . 
the net result be a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship , the kind_of comradeship which spark enthusiasm and blunt the cutting_edge of sacrifice and hardship . 
american_catholic colleges and universities be , in a very real sense , the product of `` private enterprise '' - the `` private enterprise '' of religious communities . 
had it not been for such private enterprise , diocesan authorities might of_course have been goad into establish institutions subsidize by diocesan funds and parish collections and staff by religious as paid employees . 
there be however no point in speculate about such a possibility : the fact of the_matter be that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produce the `` family business '' . 
this `` family-community '' spirit be the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement . 
it be this spirit which explain some of the anomalies of american_catholic higher education , in_particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas . 
i think for_example of three women 's colleges with pitifully small enrollments , cluster within a_few miles of a major catholic university , which be also co-educational . 
this be not an isolated example ; this aspect of the total picture has been comment upon often enough . 
it would seem to represent esprit_de_corps run riot . 
apart , however , from the question of wasteful duplication , there be another aspect of the `` family business '' spirit in american_catholic higher education which deserve closer scrutiny . 
for while the past needs of the church in_this country may have been adequately meet by collegiate institutions , which in temper and tone closely resemble junior_colleges and finishing schools , it would seem that today 's need be for the college which more closely resemble the university in its `` pursuit of excellence '' . 
at the earlier `` pre-academic excellence '' stage of catholic education , the operation could be conduct on an intra-mural community basis . 
but with today 's demand for professional qualifications and specialized training , the need for `` outsiders '' become more pressing . 
the problem be not merely that more `` outside teachers '' be needed but that a different brand is call_for . 
comment on the earlier stage , the notre_dame chapter of the american_association of university_professors ( in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making ) note that the term `` teacher-employee '' ( as oppose to , e._g. , `` maintenance employee '' ) be a not inapt description . 
today however , the `` outsider '' be likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order ( otherwise the college would not be interested in hire him ) and to be acclimatize to the democratic processes of the secular or state university . 
and while no one expect total democracy on the academic scene , the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second_class citizenship draw_on any basis other_than that of academic rank or professional achievement . 
in the above mention report of the notre_dame chapter of the american_association of university_professors , the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerge very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it : `` even with the best of intentions he ( the president of the university ) be loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of_which , consider ( as it must be by him ) in individual terms , be inhomogeneous , mortal and of extremely varying temperament , interests and capabilities . 
it be natural that he should turn_to for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually own the university and whose goals be , in their opinion , identify with its highest good and ( to use that oft-repeated phrase ) ' the attainment of excellence '' ' . 
the pattern here picture be clearly not peculiar_to notre_dame : it be simply that the paradox involve in_this kind_of control of the institution by `` the organization which actually own '' it , become more obvious where there be a larger and more distinguished `` outside '' faculty . 
it be particularly interesting that those who frame the report should refer to `` the organization which actually own the university '' : this seem to show an awareness of the fact that there be more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension . 
but in_any_case , one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regard_as a particularly happy one . 
`` outside '' faculty_members want to be consider partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business . 
there be two reasons why failure to come_to_grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the catholic university . 
in_the_first_place there be the obvious problem of recruit high caliber personnel . 
word spread rapidly in the tightly_knit academic profession , much given to attend meetings and conferences . 
expressions of even low-key dissatisfaction by a catholic college faculty_member have the effect of confirm the already existing stereotype . 
in the academic world there be seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott : 
all that happen be that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the catholic institution will be as_good_as those elsewhere . 
to appreciate the nature of the gamble , it should be realize that while college teaching be almost a public symbol of security , that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary_school system or in the civil_service . 
much has been make of the fact that major catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure . 
this be a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerate . 
when a man invest a block of his years at a university without gain the coveted promotion , not_only is he face with the problem of start over but there be also a certain depreciation in the market_value of his services . 
a man does not make that kind_of gamble if he suspect that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserve for members of the `` family '' . 
just_as it be possible to exaggerate the draw power of the new tenure practices , it be also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries pay by major catholic institutions . 
adequate compensation be indispensable . 
yet adequate compensation - and particularly merely adequate compensation be no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earn potential by take_up college teaching in_the_first_place . 
broadly speak the total catholic atmosphere be such an intangible but the larger demand be for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university . 
religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather_than the academic community be prone to underestimate both the layman 's reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification . 
there be no need here to spell_out the conditions of creative teaching except to point_out that , at the college_level , the sense of community and of community responsibility be even more necessary than it be at other levels . 
the college teacher need the stimulus of communication with other faculty_members but he also need to feel that such communication , even informal debates over the luncheon table , be a contribution to the total good of the institution . 
but this in_turn mean that decisions are not merely impose from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation . 
the second reason for be concerned with the dichotomy between faculty_members who be part of the `` in-group '' that own and operate the institution and those who be merely paid employees , be , therefore , the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself . 
this be a problem that go considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure . 
yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control , there be nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in_order . 
the first be a negative warning : there be no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory_boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority . 
in the case of academic personnel the `` feeling '' of participation can hardly be `` fake '' . 
competent teachers be well versed in the technique of lead students to pre-set conclusions without destroy the students ' illusion that they are make their own decisions . 
those who have serve as faculty advisers be too familiar_with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be take_in by `` busy-work '' and ersatz decision_making . 
in_any_case it be by_no_means clear that formally structured organs of participation be what be call_for at_all . 
in the notre_dame report , reference was make to the fact that faculty_members were reduce to `` luncheon-table communication '' . 
in itself there be nothing wrong with this form of `` participation '' : 
the only difficulty on the catholic campus be that those faculty_members who be in a position to implement policy , i. e. , members of the religious community which own and administer the institution , have their own eating arrangements . 
sen._john._mcclellan of arkansas and rep._david_martin of nebraska are again beat the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws . 
once_more the fallacious equation is advance to argue that since business is restrict under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor_unions : the law must treat everybody equally . 
or , in the words of anatole_france , `` the law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as_well as the poor , from beg in the streets and sleep under bridges '' . 
the public atmosphere that has been generate which make acceptance of_this law a possibility stem from the disrepute into which the labor_movement has fall as a result of mr._mcclellan 's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plague industrial relations at the missile sites . 
the senator was shock by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delay our missile program . 
in_addition , disclosures that missile workers were earn sums far in_excess of_what is pay for equivalent work elsewhere provoke his indignation on behalf of the american taxpayer who was foot the bill . 
it is now disclose that the taxpayer not_only pay for high wages , but he pay the employers ' strike expenses when the latter undertake to fight a strike . 
business_week ( aug. 9 , 1961 ) report that the united_aircraft_company , against which the international_association of machinists had undertake a strike , decide to keep its plants operate . 
the company incur some $ 10 million of expenses attributable to four factors : advertising to attract new employees , hiring and training them , extra overtime , and defective work perform by the new workers . 
the company has bill the united_states_government for $ 7500000 of these expenses under the defense_department regulation allow costs of a type generally recognize as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor 's business . 
rep._frank_kowalski of connecticut has bring this problem to the attention of the armed_services committee . 
the committee remain unresponsive . 
neither has congressman_martin nor senator_mcclellan been hear from on the_matter ; they be preoccupied with end labor abuses by extend the anti-monopoly laws to the unions . 
the recent publicity attend the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a_number_of electrical manufacturers has evoke a new respect for the anti-trust laws that_is justify neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtain . 
the anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete , but along completely undefined lines ; it must play a game in_which there never be a winner . 
the fact be that any business that want to operate successfully cannot follow the law . 
hypocrisy thus become the answer to a foolish public policy . 
let us look_at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in_which general_electric , westinghouse and a_number_of other manufacturers were recently convict of engage in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market . 
the industry be so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocate - whether marginal or average pricing is apply . 
the problem become even more complex where an enterprise is engage in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in_addition to the heavy electrical equipment . 
accounting procedures can be vary to provide a rationale for almost any price . 
naturally , enterprises of the size of general_electric be in a position to structure their prices in_such_a_way that the relatively small competitors can be force to the wall in a very short_time . 
should these giants really flex their competitive muscles , they would become the only survivors in the industry . 
uncle_sam would then accuse them of create a monopoly by `` unfair competition '' . 
but if they show self-restraint , they do n't get the orders . 
under_the_circumstances , the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind_of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convict . 
engage in such a conspiracy be an act of mercy by the giants . 
the paradox implicit_in the whole affair is show by the demand of the government , after the conviction , that general_electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows . 
in_other_words , the anti-trust laws , design to reduce prices to the consumer on monday , wednesday and friday , become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on tuesday , thursday and saturday . 
and which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on sunday ? 
the question might be ask : `` do n't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts ? 
why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas , throw a_few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter , express their complete confidence in the laws '' ? 
the past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explain by thurman_arnold , in the folklore of capitalism , back in 1937 . 
he write : `` the anti-trust laws be the answer of a society which unconsciously feel the need of great organizations , and at_the_same_time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social_structure . 
anti-trust laws become the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship . 
when corporate abuses were attack , it was do on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoke rather_than control . 
in_this manner , every scheme for direct control break to_pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws . 
in_any_event , it be obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever know , hold together by some of the_most fantastic ideas , all base on the fundamental notion that a corporation be an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government '' . 
this escape from control has lead to management 's evaluate the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while . 
a plea of nolo_contendere , follow by a nominal fine , after_all be a small price to pay for this untrammeled license . 
( the penalties hand_out in the electrical case , which include jail sentences , be unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions , perhaps because the conspirators had display unusual ineptness in their pricing activities . ) 
if a substitute mechanism is need for the control of a fictitious impersonal market , quite obviously some method must be devise for represent the public interest . 
a secret conspiracy of manufacturers be hardly such a vehicle . 
however , one can argue that no such control be necessary as long as one pretend that the anti-trust laws be effective and rational . 
quite clearly the anti-trust laws be neither effective nor rational - and yet the argument go that they should be extend to the labor_union . 
those who favor place trade_unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocate a brand new reform . 
before 1933 , individuals who oppose trade_unions and collective_bargaining say so in plain english . 
the acceptance of collective_bargaining as a national policy in 1934 , implicit_in the write of section 7 a of the national_industrial_recovery_act , has make it impolitic to oppose collective_bargaining in_principle . 
the wagner_act , the taft-hartley_act and the landrum-griffin_act all endorse the principle of collective_bargaining . 
the basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system be the removal of wages from competition . 
if a union cannot perform this function , then collective_bargaining is being palm_off by organizers as a gigantic fraud . 
the tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor be one of the things that create a legal_profession . 
the problem must be face squarely . 
if laborers be merely commodities compete against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn ( unsupported , by_the_way , by any agricultural subsidy ) , then they may be pardon for react with complete antagonism to a system that impose such status upon them . 
human labor be exactly that - a commodity - in eighteenth - and nineteenth-century america . 
as early as 1776 , adam_smith write in the wealth of nations : `` we have no acts of parliament against combine to lower the price of work ; but many against combine to raise it '' . 
eighteenth-century england , upon whose customs our common_law was build , had outlaw unions as monopolies and conspiracies . 
in 1825 , the boston house carpenters ' strike for a ten-hour day was denounce by the organized employers , who declare : `` it is consider that all combinations by any classes of citizens intend to affect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies '' . 
there be no pious hypocrisies then about be for collective_bargaining , but against labor monopoly . 
the courts share the opinion of the employers . 
in people vs. fisher , justice_savage of the new_york supreme_court declare : 
`` without any officious and improper interference on the subject , the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulate by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of_that which is pay for it ; but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means '' . 
compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how congressman_martin , according_to the daily_labor_report of sept. 19 , 1961 , defend the necessity of enact anti-trust legislation in the field of labor `` if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages , production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages , hours and conditions of employment '' . 
senator_mcclellan is propose the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation . 
his bill , allegedly aim at hoffa , would amend the sherman , clayton and norris-laguardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in_concert with any other union - even a sister local in the same international . 
paradoxically , the same week in_which senator_mcclellan was attempt to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation , the civil_aeronautics_board was assure the airlines that if they meet in_concert to eliminate many costly features of air_travel , the action would not be deem a violation of the anti-trust act . 
indeed , it be in the field of transportation that congress has most frequently grant employers exemption from the anti-trust laws ; for_example , the organization of steamship conferences to set freight_rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers . 
at the very moment that every attempt is being make to take_out management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation , a drive be on to abolish collective_bargaining under the guise of extend the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no_more_than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight_rates . 
the passage of the sherman_act was aim at giant monopolies . 
it be most effective against trade_unions . 
in the famous danbury_hatters case , a suit was bring against the union by the loewe_company for monopolistic practices , e._g. , try to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer . 
the suit against the union be successful and many workers lose their homes to pay_off the judgment . 
in 1914 , the clayton_act attempt to take_out labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by state that human labor was not to be consider a commodity . 
the law could not suspend economics . 
labor remain a commodity - but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti-trust laws . 
the courts , by interpretation , emasculate the act . 
in 1922 , the united_mine workers strike the coronado_coal_company . 
the company sue under the anti-trust laws , allege that the union 's activity interfere with the movement of interstate commerce . 
( what other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise ? ) 
the court first rule that the strike constitute only an indirect interference with commerce . 
at a closed-door session on capitol_hill last week , secretary_of_state christian_herter make his final report to the senate_foreign relations committee on u._s. affairs abroad . 
afterward , tennessee 's democratic senator_albert_gore sum_up it up for newsmen . 
what herter present , say gore , be `` not a very encouraging review '' . 
that be something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the west and communism erupt on three fronts . 
while communists were undermine united_nations efforts to rescue the congo from chaos , two other communist offensives stir the eisenhower_administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions . 
hours after a parade of his new soviet tanks and artillery , dictator_fidel_castro suddenly confront the u._s. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours , the u._s. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone total 87 u._s. citizens , plus 120 cuban employees ) . 
president_eisenhower hold an 8 : 30 a. m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decide to break_off diplomatic relations immediately . 
`` there be a limit to what the united_states in self-respect can endure '' , say the president . 
`` that limit has now been reach '' . 
through secretary_herter , ike offer president-elect_kennedy an opportunity to associate his new administration with the breakoff decision . 
kennedy , through secretary-designate of state_dean_rusk , decline . 
he thus keep his hands free for any action after jan. 20 , although reaction to the break be generally favorable in the u._s. and latin_america ( see the hemisphere ) . 
after a white_house huddle between the president and top lieutenants , the defense_department react sharply to a cry from the pro-western government of laos that several battalions of communist troops had invade laos from north viet_nam . 
`` in_view of the present situation in laos '' , say the pentagon 's announcement , `` we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the pacific '' . 
cut_short a holiday at hong_kong , the aircraft_carriers lexington and bennington steam off into the south_china_sea , accompany by a swarm of destroyers , plus troopships load with marines . 
on the u._s . 's island base of okinawa , task_force 116 , make_up of army , navy , marine and air_force units , get braced to move southward on signal . 
but by week 's end the laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration ( see foreign_news ) , and the u._s. was agree with its cautious british and french allies that a neutralist - rather_than a pro-western - government might be best for laos . 
there be a moral of sorts in the laotian situation that say much about all other cold-war fronts . 
political , economic and military experts be all agreed that chaotic , mountainous little laos be the last place in the world to fight a war - and they be probably right . 
`` it would be like fight the_french and indian_war all_over again '' , say one military_man . 
but why be laos the new southeast asian battleground ? 
at geneva in 1954 , to get the war in indo-china settled , the_british and french give_in to russian and communist chinese demands and agree to the set_up of a communist state , north viet_nam - which then , predictably , become a base for communist operations against neighboring south viet_nam and laos . 
the late secretary_of_state john_foster_dulles consider the 1954 geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement , see that resolution would be needed to keep it from become a calamity for the west . 
he begin the diplomatic discussions that result in the establishment of seato . 
`` the important thing from_now_on '' , he say , `` be not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern viet_nam from lead to the extension of communism throughout southeast_asia '' . 
russian tanks and artillery parade through the streets of havana , russian intrigue in the congo , and russian arms drops in laos ( use the same ilyushin transports that were use to carry communist agents to the congo ) make it plain once_more that the cold_war be all_of a_piece in space and time . 
soviet premier_khrushchev send new_year 's hopes for peace to president-elect_kennedy , and get a cool acknowledgment in_reply . 
considering the state of the whole world , the cold_war 's three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous ; but , in senator_gore 's words , it be `` not a very encouraging '' situation that would confront john_f._kennedy on inauguration_day . 
as the 87 th congress begin its sessions last week , liberal democrats be ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates control by the house_rules_committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor . 
the liberal pressure bloc ( which coyly masquerade under the name democratic study_group ) had fight the committee before , and had always lose . 
this time , they be much better prepared and organized , and the political climate be favorable . 
they have the unspoken support of president-elect_kennedy , whose own legislative program was menace by the rules_committee bottleneck . 
and count noses , they seem to have the votes to work their will . 
there be two possible methods of breach the conservative barriers around the rules_committee : 1 ) to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock , or 2 ) to remove one of the conservatives - namely mississippi 's 14 - term william_meyers_colmer ( pronounce calmer ) . 
caucus , the liberals decide to go_after colmer , which actually be the more drastic course , since seniority in the house be next to godliness . 
a dour , gangling man with a choppy gait , colmer look younger than his 70 years , has gradually swing from a moderate , internationalist position to_that of a diehard conservative . 
he be generally and initially suspicious of any federal project , unless it happen to benefit his gulf_coast constituents . 
he be , of_course , a segregationist , but he say he has never make an `` anti-negro '' speech . 
for 20 years he has enjoy his power on the rules_committee . 
there his vote , along with those of chairman_howard_smith , the courtly virginia judge , and the four republican members , could and often did produce a 6 - 6 deadlock that block far-out , democratic-sponsored welfare legislation ( a tactic often acceptable to the rayburn-johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes ) . 
there be sufficient pretext to demand colmer 's ouster : he had give his lukewarm support to the anti-kennedy electors in mississippi . 
reprisals be not unheard of in such situations , but the recent tendency has be for the congress to forgive its prodigal sons . 
in 1949 the dixiecrats escape unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against harry_truman , and in 1957 , after congressman_adam_clayton_powell campaign for dwight_eisenhower in 1956 , his fellow democrats did not touch his committee assignments , although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage . 
( in the heat of the anti-colmer drive last week , judge_smith threaten reprisal against powell . 
say he : `` we will see whether whites and negroes are treat the same around here '' . ) 
but speaker_sam_rayburn , after huddle in palm_beach with president-elect_kennedy , decide that this year something had to be do about the rules_committee - and that he be the only man who could do anything effective . 
in a tense , closed-door session with judge_smith , rayburn attempt to work_out a compromise : to add three new members to the rules_committee ( two democrats , include one southerner , and one republican ) . 
smith flatly reject the offer , and mister_sam thereupon decide to join the rebels . 
the next morning he summon a group of top democrats to his private office and break the news : he would lead the fight to oust colmer , whom he is say to regard_as `` an inferior man '' . 
news of rayburn 's commitment soon leak_out . 
when missouri 's clarence_cannon get the word , he turn purple . 
`` unconscionable '' ! he shout , and rush_off to the speaker 's room to object : `` a dangerous precedent '' ! 
cannon , a powerful , conservative man , bring welcome support to the smith-colmer forces : as chairman of the appropriations_committee , he hold_over each member the dreadful threat of exclude this or that congressional_district from federal pork-barrel projects . 
sit quietly on an equally big pork_barrel was another judge_smith ally , georgia 's carl_vinson , chairman of the armed_services committee . 
as the battle rage in the cloakrooms and caucuses , it became clear that judge_smith could lose . 
his highest count of supporters number 72 - and he need nearly twice that number to control the 260 - member democratic caucus . 
the liberals , smell blood , were face with the necessity of win three big votes - in the democratic committee on committees , in the full party caucus , and on the floor of the house - before they could oust colmer . 
( one big question : if colmer was to be purge , what should the house do about the other three senior mississippians who support the maverick electors ? ) 
in_all three arenas , they seem certain of victory - especially with sam_rayburn apply his whiplash . 
but in the prospect of win the battle loom the specter of lose a costlier war . 
if the southerners be sufficiently aroused , they could very_well cut the kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage_point of committee chairmanships , leave sam_rayburn lead a truncated , unworkable party . 
with_that possibility in mind , arkansas ' wilbur_mills deliberately delay call a meeting of the committee on committees , and coolheaded democrats seek to bring_together rayburn and smith together again to work_out some sort_of face-saving compromise . 
`` here be two old_men , mad at each other and too proud to pick_up the phone '' , say a house democratic leader . 
`` one want a_little more power , and the other does n't want to give_up any '' . 
the senate launch the 87 th congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle , but in contrast with the house 's guerrilla war it seem as pro_forma as a capitol guide 's speech . 
question at_issue : how big a vote should be necessary to restrict senate debate - and thereby cut_off legislation-delaying filibusters ? 
a wide-ranging , bipartisan force - from minnesota 's democratic hubert_humphrey to massachusetts ' republican_leverett_saltonstall - was draw_up against a solid phalanx of southern democrats , who have traditionally use the filibuster to stop civil_rights bills . 
new_mexico 's clint_anderson offer a resolution to change the senate 's notorious rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the senators present and vote to cut_off debate , instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds . 
fair_dealer_humphrey up the ante , ask cloture power for a mere majority of senators . 
georgia 's dick_russell object politely , and the battle was join . 
privately , the liberals admit that the humphrey amendment have no chance of passage . 
privately , they also admit that their hopes for clint_anderson 's three-fifths modification depend_on none other_than republican_richard_nixon . 
in 1957 nixon deliver a significant opinion that a majority of senators have the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new congress , and that any rules lay_down by previous congresses be not binding . 
arm with the nixon opinion , the senate liberals round_up their slim majority and prepare to choke_off debate on the filibuster battle this week . 
hopefully , the perennial battle of rule 22 then would be fight to a settlement once_and_for_all . 
since election_day , vice_president richard_nixon had virtually retire - by his own wish - from public view . 
but with the convening of the new congress , he be the public man again , preside over the senate until john_kennedy 's inauguration . 
one_day last week , nixon face a painful constitutional chore that require him to officiate at a joint session of congress to hear the official tally of the electoral_college vote , and_then to make `` sufficient declaration '' of the election of the man who defeat him in the tight 1960 presidential election . 
nixon fulfil his assignment with grace , then go beyond the required `` sufficient declaration '' . 
`` this be the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announce the result of an election in_which he was defeat '' , he say . 
the masters golf tournament prove last monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves . 
gary_player , the small , trim south_african , be the eventual winner , but in_all his 25 years he never spend a more harrowing afternoon as he wait for the victory to drop in his lap . 
arnold_palmer , the defending champion , lose his title on the 72 nd hole after a_few minutes of misfortune that leave even his fellow pros gape in disbelief . 
`` just when you think you have it lick , this golf_course can get_up and bite you '' , player had say one afternoon midway through the tournament . 
and that be just what happen on the last few holes . 
the augusta_national golf_club course get_up and bite both player and palmer . 
player be the first to feel its teeth . 
after play a splendid first nine holes in 34 - two strokes under par - on this fifth and final day of the tournament ( sunday 's fourth round had been wash_out by a violent rainstorm when it be only half complete ) , player 's game rapidly fall to pieces . 
he bogey the 10 th . 
after a journey through woods and stream he double_bogey the 13 th . 
he bogey the 15 th by miss a short putt and finally scramble through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2 - over-par 74 and a 72 - hole total of 280 . 
as he sign his scorecard and walk off the course , player be almost in tears . 
he could read on the nearby scoreboard that palmer , by then play the 15 th hole , was lead him by a stroke . 
palmer had start the round four strokes behind player , and at one point in the afternoon had trail by as_many as six strokes . 
now all he have to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf . 
when palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72 nd hole , he seem to have the championship won . 
but the seven-iron shot he use to approach the green stray into a bunker and lodge in a slight depression . 
in try to hit it out with a sand_wedge palmer bounce the ball over the green , past spectators and down the slope toward a tv tower . 
afterwards , palmer tell charlie_coe , his last-round partner , that he simply play the hole too fast . 
he did seem hasty on his second and third shots , but then there be an agonizing wait of several minutes while coe graciously putt out , give palmer a chance to recover his composure , which he had quite visibly lose . 
when the shaken palmer finally did hit his fourth shot , he overshoot the hole by 15 feet . 
palmer was now putt merely for a tie , and player , who was sit beside his wife and watch it all on television in tournament_chairman_clifford_roberts ' clubhouse apartment , stare in amazement when palmer miss the putt . 
palmer 's 281 for the four rounds at augusta be a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro , but it be barely good enough for a second-place tie with coe . 
the lean and leathery oklahoma amateur , who has been play topnotch tournament golf for many years , refuse to let the masters jitters overtake him and close the tournament with his second straight 69 . 
until late last saturday afternoon palmer had play seven consecutive rounds_of_golf at the masters - four last year and three this - without ever be out of first place . 
as evening approach and palmer finish his saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73 , this remarkable record be still intact , thanks to his thursday and friday rounds of 68 and 69 . 
his three-round total of 210 be three strokes better than the next best score , a 213 by bill_collins , the tall and deliberate baltimorean who had been play very_well all winter long . 
but palmer know , as did everybody else at augusta , that his streak be about to be break . 
half an hour after he finish his round , player hole_out at the 18 th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206 , four strokes ahead of palmer . 
more_than a streak had end . 
long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on sunday have become meteorological footnotes , the 1961 masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between arnold_palmer and gary_player . 
unlike most such sports rivalries , it appear to have develop almost spontaneously , although this be not exactly the case . 
when the winter tour begin at los_angeles last january there be no one in_sight to challenge palmer 's towering prestige . 
as if to confirm his stature , he quickly win three of the first eight tournaments . 
player win only one . 
but as the tour reach pensacola a month ago , player was lead palmer in official winnings by a_few hundred dollars , and the rest of the field be somewhere off in nowhere . 
on the final round at pensacola , the luck of the draw pair palmer and player in the same threesome and , although it be far from obvious at_the_time , the gallery was treat to the first chapter of_what promise to be one of the_most exciting duels in sport for a long_time to come . 
on_that final sunday at pensacola neither palmer nor player was lead the tournament and , as it turn_out , neither win it . 
but whichever of these two finish ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour . 
player immediately prove he was not in_the_least awe by the dramatic proximity of palmer . 
he outplay palmer all_around the course and finish with a tremendous 65 to palmer 's 71 . 
thereafter , until the masters , player gradually increase his lead over palmer in winnings and add one more tournament victory at miami . 
when they reach augusta last week , together they had win five of the 13 tournaments to_date . 
on thursday , the first day of the masters , the contest between palmer and player develop instantly . 
it be a dismal , drizzly day but a good one on_which to score over the augusta_national course . 
the usually skiddy greens be moist and soft , so the golfers be able to strike their approach_shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too_much worry about the consequences . 
palmer 's 4 - under-par 68 get him off to an early lead , which he share with bob_rosburg . 
but player be only one stroke back , with a 69 . 
even_so , it be still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators - unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever - that this tournament be to be , essentially , a match between palmer and player . 
a_lot_of people were still think_about jack_nicklaus , the spectacular young amateur , who have a 70 ; or ken_venturi , who have a somewhat shaky 72 but be bound_to do better ; or rosburg , whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many_of augusta 's treacheries ; or even old byron_nelson , whose excellent 71 make one wonder if he had solve the geriatric aspects of golf . 
( on thursday nobody except charlie_coe was think_of charlie_coe . ) 
on friday , a day as cloudless and lovely as thursday had be gray and ugly , the plot of the tournament come clearly into focus . 
rosburg had start early in the day , and by the time palmer and player be on the course - separate , as they were destine to be for the rest of the weekend , by about half an hour - they could see on the numerous scoreboards spot around the course that rosburg , who end with a 73 , was not have a good_day . 
as player begin his second round in a twosome with amateur bill_hyndman , his share of the gallery be not conspicuously large for a contender . 
player begin with a birdie on the first hole , add five straight pars and_then another birdie at the 9 th . 
on the back nine he begin to acquire the tidal_wave of a gallery that stay with him the rest of the tournament . 
he birdie the 13 th , the 15 th and the 18 th - five birdies , one bogey and 12 pars for a 68 . 
start half an hour behind player in company with british open_champion_kel_nagle , palmer birdie the 2 nd , the 9 th , the 13 th and the 16 th - four birdies , one bogey and 13 pars for a 69 . 
the roar of palmer 's gallery as he sink a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of augusta , only to be answer moments later by the roar of player 's gallery for a similar triumph . 
at one point late in the day , when palmer was line_up a 25 - foot putt on the 16 th , a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18 th green unmistakably announce that player had birdie the final hole . 
without so_much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had notice ( although he later admit that he had ) palmer proceed to sink his 25 - footer , and his gallery send its explosive vocalization roll back along the intervening fairways in_reply . 
anyone who now doubt that a personal duel be under_way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were play this most difficult golf_course . 
it be almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period_of_time attack their shots with a vehemence border_on violence . 
the bad_luck that can so often mar a well-played round_of_golf is simply overpower and obliterate by the contemptuous boldness of these champions . 
bob_jones play that way . 
byron_nelson did , hogan did . 
and last week at the masters_palmer and player did . 
as the third round of the tournament begin on saturday and the duel was resume in_earnest , it be player 's superior aggressiveness that carry him into the lead . 
this day palmer had start first . 
as player step on the first tee he know that palmer had birdie the first two holes and already be 2 under par for the day . 
player immediately proceed to follow_suit . 
in_fact , he go_on to birdie the 6 th and 8 th as_well , to go 4 under par for the first eight holes . 
but player 's real test come on the ninth hole , a downhill dogleg to the left measure 420 yards . 
he hit a poor tee shot , pull it off into the pine woods separate the 9 th and first fairways . 
having hit one of the trees , the ball come to rest not more_than 160 yards out . 
player then have the choice of punch the ball safely out of the woods to the 9 th fairway and settle for a bogey 5 , or gambling . 
the latter involve hit a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse , hope to slice it back to the deeply bunker 9 th green . 
`` i was hit the ball well '' , player say later , `` and i feel strong . 
when you 're play like that you 'd better attack '' . 
player attack with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who see it will ever forget . 
it strike the 9 th green on_the_fly and stop just off the edge . 
from there he chip back and sink his putt for a par 4 . 
palmer , meanwhile , had been have his troubles . 
they start on the 4 th hole , a 220 - yard par-3 . 
on_this_day the wind had switch 180 ` from the northwest to the southeast , and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days . 
at the 4 th tee palmer choose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood be the proper club , so he put the ball in a bunker in_front of the green . 
his bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 bring him back to even par . 
start the second nine , palmer be already four strokes behind player and know it . 
when mickey_charles_mantle , the new_york yankees ' man of muscle , drive a home_run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touch upon the_sublime . 
when roger_eugene_maris , mantle 's muscular teammate , power four home_runs in a double-header , his performance merit awe . 
but when tiny , 145 - pound albert_gregory_pearson of the los_angeles angels , who once catch three straight fly_balls in center field because , as a teammate explain , `` the other team think no one be out there '' , hit seven home_runs in four months ( three more_than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement border_on the ridiculous . 
this be baseball 1961 . 
this be the year home_runs range from the_sublime to the ridiculous . 
it be the year when ( 1 ) amiable jim_gentile of the baltimore_orioles amble to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and , in unprecedented style , deliver consecutive grand-slam home_runs ; ( 2 ) willie_mays of the san_francisco giants borrow a teammate 's bat and become the ninth big_leaguer to stroke four home_runs in a game ; ( 3 ) the milwaukee_braves tie a major-league record with fourteen home_runs in three games and lose two of them ; and ( 4 ) catcher johnny_blanchard of the new_york yankees match a record with home_runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitter . 
pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats , the shrinking strike zone , and the fact that the knock-down pitch be now illegal . 
experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the american_league cause by expansion . 
whatever the reasons , not in 30 years has a single season produce such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records , home-run division . 
of all the records in peril , one stand apart , dramatic in its making , dramatic in its endurance , and now , doubly dramatic in its jeopardy . 
this , of_course , be baseball 's most remarkable mark : the 60 home_runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure , the incredible athlete , george_herman ( babe ) ruth of the yankees . 
since 1927 , fewer than a dozen men have make serious runs at babe_ruth 's record and each , in_turn , has been thwart . 
what ultimately frustrate every challenger be ruth 's amazing september surge . 
in the final month of the 1927 season , he hit seventeen home_runs , a closing spurt never match . 
always , in the abortive attacks upon ruth 's record , one man alone - a jimmy_foxx ( 58 in 1932 ) or a hank_greenberg ( 58 in 1938 ) or a hack_wilson ( 56 in 1930 ) - make the bid . 
but now , for_the_first_time since lou_gehrig ( with 47 home_runs ) spur ruth on in 1927 , two men play for the same team have zero_in on 60 . 
their names be mantle and maris , their team be the yankees , and their threat be real . 
after 108 games in 1927 , ruth have 35 home_runs . 
after 108 games in 1961 , mickey_mantle have 43 , roger_maris 41 . 
extend mantle 's and maris 's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games , and , mathematically , each will hit more_than 60 home_runs . 
this be the great edge the two yankees have going_for them . 
to better ruth 's mark , neither need a spectacular september flourish . 
all mantle need be eight more home_runs in august and ten in september , and he will establish a new record . 
in ruth 's day - and until this year - the schedule be 154 games . 
baseball commissioner ford_frick has rule that ruth 's record will remain official unless it is broken_in 154 games . ) 
`` even on the basis of 154 games , this be the ideal situation '' , insist hank_greenberg , now vice-president of the chicago_white_sox . 
`` it has_to be easier with two of them . 
how can you walk maris to get_to mantle '' ? 
neither mantle nor maris , understandably , will predict 60 home_runs for himself . 
although both concede they would like to hit 60 , they stick_to primarily to the baseball_player 's standard quote : `` the important thing be to win the pennant '' . 
but one thing be for_certain : there be no dissension between mantle , the american_league 's most_valuable_player in 1956 and 1957 , and maris , the mvp in 1960 . 
each enjoy see the other hit home_runs ( `` i hope roger hit 80 '' , mantle say ) , and each enjoy even more see himself hit home_runs ( `` and i hope i hit 81 '' ) . 
the sluggers get_along so well in_fact , that with their families at_home for the summer ( mantle 's in dallas , maris 's in kansas_city ) , they are room together . 
mantle , maris , and bob_cerv , a utility outfielder , share an apartment in jamaica , long_island , not far from new_york international_airport . 
the three pay $ 251 a month for four rooms ( kitchen , dining_room , living_room , and bedroom ) , with air-conditioning and new modern furniture . 
mantle and cerv use the twin_beds in the bedroom ; maris sleep on a green studio_couch in the living_room . 
they divide up the household chores : cerv do most_of the cooking ( breakfast and sandwich snacks , with dinner out ) , mantle supply the transportation ( a white 1961 oldsmobile convertible ) , and maris drive the 25 - minute course from the apartment house to yankee_stadium . 
mantle , maris , and cerv probably share one major-league record already : among them , they have fifteen children - eight for cerv , four for mantle , and three for maris . 
as roommates , teammates , and home-run mates , mantle , 29 , who break_in with the yankees ten years ago , and maris , 26 , who come to the yankees from kansas_city two years ago , have strikingly similar backgrounds . 
both be scholastic stars in football , basketball , and baseball ( mantle in commerce , okla. , maris in fargo , n. d . ) ; as halfbacks , both come_close to play football at the university of oklahoma ( `` sometimes in the minors '' , maris recall , `` i wish i had go_to oklahoma '' ) . 
to an extent , the two even look alike . 
both have blue eyes and short blond hair . 
both be 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds , but mantle , incredibly muscular ( he have a 17 - 1 2 - inch neck ) , look bigger . 
with their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders , both must have their clothes make to_order . 
maris purchase $ 100 suits from simpson 's in new_york . 
mantle , more concerned with dress , buy his suits four at_a_time at neiman-marcus in dallas and pay as much_as $ 250 each . 
neither mantle nor maris need fear being classify an intellectual , but lately mantle has show unusual devotion to an intellectual opus , henry_miller 's `` tropic_of_cancer '' . 
mantle so appreciate miller 's delicate literary style that he broaden teammates ' minds by read sensitive passages aloud during road trips . 
mantle be not normally given to public_speaking - or , for_that_matter , to private speaking . 
`` what do you and mickey talk_about at_home '' ? a reporter ask maris recently . 
`` to tell you the truth '' , maris say , `` mickey do n't talk much '' . 
this be no surprising trait for a ballplayer . 
what be surprising and pleasant be that mantle and maris , under constant pressure from writers and photographers , are try to be cooperative . 
of the two , mantle be by nature the less outgoing , maris the more outspoken . 
but last week , when a reporter was_standing near mantle 's locker , mickey walk up and volunteer an anecdote . 
`` see that kid '' ? he say , point to a dark-haired 11 - year-old boy . 
`` that 's [ yogi ] berra 's . 
i 'll never forget one_time i strike_out three_times , drop a fly_ball , and we lose the game . 
i come_back , sit by my locker , feel real low , and the kid walk over to me , look up , and say : 
' you stink '' ' . 
maris , in talk to reporters , try to answer all questions candidly and fully , but on rare occasions , he shun newsmen . 
`` when i 've make a dumb play '' , he say , `` i do n't want to talk to anyone . 
i be angry '' . 
by his own confession , maris be an angry young_man . 
bench at tulsa in 1955 , he tell manager dutch meyer : 
`` i can n't play for you . 
send me where i can play '' . 
( meyer send him to reading , pa. . ) 
bench at indianapolis in 1956 , he tell manager kerby_farrell : `` i be not learn anything on the bench . 
play me '' . 
( farrell did - and maris lead the team to victory in the little world_series . ) 
`` that 's the way i be '' , he say . 
`` i tell people what i think . 
if you be a good ballplayer , you 've got_to get mad . 
give me a team of nine angry men and i 'll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we 'll beat you nine out of ten times '' . 
one good indication of the two men 's personalities be the way they react to meet their own heroes . 
maris 's be ted_williams . 
`` when i be a kid '' , maris tell a sportswriter last week , `` i used_to follow williams every_day in the box score , just to see whether he get a hit or not '' . 
`` when you come_up to the majors , did you seek_out williams for advice '' ? 
`` are you kid '' ? say maris . 
`` you be afraid to talk to a guy you idolize '' . 
mantle 's hero be joe_dimaggio . 
`` when mickey go to the yankees '' , say mark_freeman , an ex-yankee pitcher who sell mutual_funds in denver , `` dimaggio still was play and every_day mickey would go_by his locker , just ache for some word of encouragement from this great man , this hero of his . 
but dimaggio never say a word . 
it crush mickey . 
he tell me he vow right_then that if he ever get_to be a star , this never would be say of him '' . 
mantle has keep the vow . 
among all the yankees , he be the veteran most friendly to rookies . 
neither mantle nor maris be totally devoted_to baseball above_all else . 
if lay ties on a railroad_track , which he once do for $ 1 an hour , pay more_than play right field for the yankees , maris would lay ties on a railroad_track . 
if work in a zinc mine , which he once do for 87 - 1 2 cents an hour , pay more_than play center field for the yankees , mantle would work in a zinc mine . 
but since railroading and mining be not the highest paid arts , mantle and maris concentrate_on baseball . 
they try to play baseball the best they can . 
each be a complete ballplayer . 
mantle , beyond any question , can do more things well . 
( `` one of the reasons they get_along fine '' , say a sportswriter who be friendly with the two men , `` be that both realize mantle be head-and-shoulders above maris '' . ) 
hitting , mantle have an immediate advantage because he bat both left-handed and right-handed , maris only left-handed . 
they both possess near classic stances , dug_in firmly , arms high , set for fierce swings . 
mantle be considerably better hit for average ( .332 , fourth in the league , to .280 for maris so_far this year ) . 
both be good bunters : maris once beat_out eighteen of nineteen in the minor_leagues ; mantle be a master at drag_a_bunt toward first_base . 
both have brilliant speed : mantle was time from home_plate ( bat left-handed ) to first_base in 3.1 seconds , faster than any other major_leaguer ; maris run the 100 - yard dash in ten seconds in high_school and once win a race against luis_aparicio , the swift , base-stealing shortstop of the white_sox . 
both be good , daring fielders : mantle cover more ground ; maris 's throwing arm be stronger . 
yet with all their skills , the appeal of mantle and maris in 1961 come_down to one basic : the home_run . 
with this ultimate weapon , the two yankees may have save baseball from its dullest season . 
( american_league expansion create , inevitably , weaker teams . 
only two teams in each league [ the yankees and detroit , the dodgers and cincinnati ] are battle for first place . 
appropriately , the emphasis on the home_run , at a peak this year , come_into_being at baseball 's lowest moment . 
in 1920 , as the startling news that the 1919 white_sox had conspire to lose the world_series leak_out , fans grow disillusioned and disinterested in baseball . 
something was need to revive interest ; the something be the home_run . 
into washington on president-elect_john_f._kennedy 's convair , the caroline , wing actor-crooner_frank_sinatra and his close hollywood pal , cinemactor_peter_lawford , jack_kennedy 's brother-in-law . 
also include in the entourage : a dog in a black sweater , frankie and peter have an urgent mission : to stage a mammoth inauguration_eve entertainment gala in the capital 's national_guard armory . 
frankie was fairly glut with ideas , as he had hint upon his arrival : `` it 's really tremendous when you think ella_fitzgerald is come from australia . 
i could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all_of our plans '' ! 
as the plans were laid , some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconce in the armory 's $ 100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes price at $ 10000 each . 
the biggest single act would doubtless be stage by frankie himself : his inaugural wardrobe had been design by hollywood_couturier_don_loper , who regularly make_up ladies ' ensembles . 
soon after loper leak the news that frankie had order `` two of everything '' just `` in_case he spill anything '' , frankie get so mad at the chic designer that he vow he would not wear a stitch of loper clothing . 
a year after he was catapult over nine officers senior to him and make commandant of the marine_corps , general_david_m._shoup deliver a peppery annual report in the form of a `` happy , warless new_year '' greeting to his pentagon staff . 
say leatherneck_shoup : `` a year ago i take the grips of the plow in my hands . 
after push an accumulation of vines and weeds from the moldboard , i lift the lines from the dust and find hitch to_that plow the finest team i ever hold a rein on . 
little geeing and hawing have be necessary '' . 
but shoup also give the corps a tilling in_spots . 
speak of `` pride '' , he deplore the noncommissioned_officer `` whose uniform look_like it belong_to someone who retire in 1940 ; the officer with the yellow socks or the bay_window . 
a_few of these people be still around '' . 
old and new briefly cross paths in the u._s._senate , then go their respective ways . 
at a reception for new members of congress , oregon_democrat_maurine_neuberger , take the senate seat hold by her husband richard until his death last march , get a brotherly buss from democratic elder_statesman adlai_stevenson , u._s._ambassador-designate to the u._n. . 
meanwhile , after 24 years in the senate , rhode_island 's durable democrat_theodore_francis_greene - having walk , swim and cerebrate himself to the hearty age of 93 - leave that august body ( voluntarily , because he could surely have been reelect had he choose to run again last november ) , as the oldest man ever to serve in the senate . 
the_most famous undergraduate of south_philadelphia high_school be a current bobby-sox idol , dreamboat_cacophonist_fabian ( real name : fabian_forte ) , 17 , and last week it develop that he will remain an undergraduate for_a_while . 
the principal of the school announce that - despite the help of private tutors in hollywood and philadelphia - fabian be a 10 - o ' clock scholar in english and mathematics . 
lack his needed credits in those subjects , fabian will not graduate with his old classmates next week . 
south_philadelphia_high 's principal add that the current delay was cause by the `` pressure '' of a movie that the toneless lad was make .

one of nikita_khrushchev 's most enthusiastic eulogizers , the u._s._s. r . 's daily izvestia , enterprisingly interview red-prone comedian charlie_chaplin at his swiss villa , where he has be in self-exile since 1952 . 
chaplin , 71 , who meet k. when the soviet boss visit england in 1956 , confide that he hope to visit russia some time this summer because `` i have marvel at your grandiose experiment and i believe_in your future '' . 
then charlie spooned out some quick impressions of the nikita he had glimpse : `` i was captivate by his humor , frankness and good_nature and by his kind , strong and somewhat sly face '' . 
g._david_thompson be one of those names know to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in europe 's best hotels , but he be somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of pittsburgh . 
there the name vaguely connote new-rich wealth , a reputation for eccentricity , and an ardor for collect art . 
last week , in the german city of du ^ sseldorf , g._david_thompson was make headlines that could well give pittsburgh pause . 
on display be 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection - and every single one of them was up for_sale . 
like philadelphia 's late dr._albert_c._barnes who keep his own great collection closed to the general public ( time , jan. 2 ) , thompson , at 61 , be something of a legend in his own lifetime . 
he make his fortune during world_war 2 , when he take_over a_number_of dying steel plants and keep them alive until the boom . 
even before he hit big money , he had begin buy modern paintings . 
he give the impression of never having read a word about art , but there be no_doubt that he have an eye for the best . 
he be able to smell a bargain - and a masterpiece - a continent away , and the museum of modern_art 's alfred_barr say of him : `` i have never mention a new artist that thompson did n't know about '' . 
he might barge into a gallery , start haggle over prices without so_much as a word of greeting . 
he could be lavishly generous with friends , cab drivers and bellboys , but with dealers he be tough . 
he buy_up cezannes , braques , matisses , legers , a splendid picasso series , more_than 70 giacometti sculptures . 
he gather one of the biggest collections of paul_klees in the world . 
all these he hang in his burglarproof home called stone 's_throw , outside pittsburgh , and only people he like and trust ever got_to see them . 
two years ago thompson offer his collection to the city . 
but he insist that it be house in a special museum . 
pittsburgh turn_down him down , just_as pittsburgh society had been snub him for years . 
he go_to then to a 40 - year-old basel art_dealer name ernst_beyeler , with whom he had long been trade pictures . 
last year beyeler arrange to sell $ 1500000 worth of klees to the state of north_rhine-westphalia , which will house them in a museum that be yet to be build . 
last week most_of the other prizes , once offer to pittsburgh , go on the block . 
at the opening of the du ^ sseldorf show , thompson himself scarcely glance at the treasures that he was see together for the last time . 
in_fact he seem delighted to get_rid_of them . 
some observers speculate that this might be his revenge on his home town . 
thompson himself say : `` i want to enjoy once_more the pleasure of bare walls wait for new pictures '' . 
the university of georgia has long claim that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color . 
but in_all its 175 years , not a single negro student has enter its classrooms . 
last week federal_district judge_william_a._bootle order the university to admit immediately a `` qualified '' negro boy and girl . 
their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education , from kindergarten through graduate_school , in georgia - and in alabama , mississippi and south_carolina as_well . 
for 18 months , hamilton_holmes , 19 , and charlayne_hunter , 18 , had try to get_into the university . 
they graduate together from atlanta 's turner high_school , where valedictorian_holmes be first in the class and charlayne third . 
the university reject them on a variety of pretexts , but be careful never to mention the color of their skins . 
holmes go_to atlanta 's morehouse ( negro ) college , where he be a b + student and star halfback . 
charlayne study journalism at detroit 's wayne_state_university . 
last fall , after they took their hopes for enter georgia to court , judge_bootle order them to apply again . 
charlayne was `` tentatively '' admit for next fall , after state investigators question her white roommate at wayne_state . 
but holmes was reject again `` on the basis of his record and interview '' . 
the evidence in court be testimony about the interview , which for holmes last an hour , although at_least one white student at georgia get_through this ritual by a simple phone conversation . 
holmes was ask if he had ever visit a house_of_prostitution , or a `` beatnik parlor or teahouse '' . 
no , say he , but officials still call him `` evasive '' . 
they also say he lie in say that he had never been `` arrest '' . 
their reason : holmes once pay a $ 20 speeding fine , have his license suspend . 
negro lawyers dig_into the records of 300 white students , find that many were hardly interview at_all - and few have academic records as_good_as hamilton_holmes . 
the real reason for his rejection , they argue , be the fact that georgia law automatically cut_off funds for any desegregated school . 
judge_bootle 's decision : `` the two plaintiffs be qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admit had it not be for their race and color '' . 
the state will appeal - but few think it will actually try to close the university . 
`` surprised and pleased '' , students holmes and hunter may enter the university of georgia this week . 
when the university of chicago 's chancellor_lawrence_a._kimpton submit his resignation last march , a mighty talent hunt grip the midway . 
out go_out letters to 60000 old grads , ask for suggestions . 
such academic statesmen as james_b._conant were consult . 
two committees ponder 375 possible kimpton successors , include adlai_stevenson , richard_nixon , and harvard 's dean_mcgeorge_bundy . 
the debate lead to a decision that chicago need neither a big name nor an experienced academic_administrator , but rather , as trustee_chairman_glen_a._lloyd put it , `` a top scholar in his own right '' - a bright light to lure other top scholars to chicago . 
last week chicago happily find its top scholar in caltech 's acting dean of the faculty : dynamic geneticist_george_wells_beadle , 57 , who share the 1958 nobel_prize in medicine and physiology for discover how genes affect heredity by control cell chemistry ( time , cover , july_14 , 1958 ) . 
it fall to chancellor_kimpton , now a standard_oil ( indiana ) executive , to spend his nine-year reign tidy_up chicago after the 21 - year typhoon of idealist robert_maynard_hutchins . 
he throw_out some of hutchins ' more wildly experimental courses , raise sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2100 , nearly double endowment to $ 139.3 million . 
but though kimpton put chicago in_what he feel be working order , some old grads feel that it still need the kind_of lively teachers who fill it in the heady hutchins era . 
at caltech , geneticist_beadle has stick_to close_to his research as head of the school 's famous biology division since 1946 . 
but he has show a sixth-sense ability to spot , recruit and excite able researchers , and has develop unexpected talents in fund raising and speech-making . 
beadle be even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters ; he avidly read the wall_street journal , and take delight in drive a $ 250 model a ford for 22 years , then sell it for $ 300 . 
a philosopher may point_out that the troubles of the congo begin with the old adam and consequently will never end . 
but a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold_out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass_away . 
the man be king_leopold 2 , of the belgians , who in 1885 conclude that he had_better grab a colony while the grabbing be still good . 
by force , he take under his protection , or steal , 900000 square_miles of wilderness in central_africa . 
this be an area nearly as large as western europe ; and it be filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . 
its boundaries have nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; they were determine by the points at which leopold 's explorers and gunmen get tired of walk . 
the population of the congo be 13.5 million , divide into at_least seven major `` culture clusters '' and innumerable tribes speak 400 separate dialects . 
the religions of the people include christianity , mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor_worship and animism . 
the climate range from the steamily equatorial to the temperate . 
the hospitals contain patients trample by elephants or run_over by sports_cars . 
to make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in_any_case ; it has been make far more difficult by what the belgians have do , or fail to do , in the congo since 1885 . 
at_first the belgian royal_family administer the congo as its own private_property . 
but by 1908 its record of brutality had touch the national conscience . 
the belgian government itself take_over administration , commence a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism . 
one definition of paternalism be `` the principle or practice , on the part of a government , of manage the affairs of a country in the manner of a father deal with his children '' . 
the honor of the belgians in_this matter be not to be question - only their judgment . 
ordinarily a father permit his children to grow_up in_due_time - but when the colony receive independence in 1960 the congolese child , if one imagine him to have be_born in 1908 , be 52 and had until then been treat as an infant . 
the belgians be interested primarily in the economic development of the congo , which be rich_in copper , tin , cobalt , manganese , zinc , and uranium , and cotton and palm_oil . 
the colony was administer from brussels , with neither the congolese nor the resident belgians have any vote . 
the beneficiaries of_this administration be a_number_of huge cartels in_which both individuals and the belgian government itself hold stock . 
in inside africa , john_gunther describe one of these , the societe_generale , as `` the kind_of colossus that might be envisage if , let us say , the house of morgan , anaconda copper , the mutual life_insurance company of new_york , the pennsylvania_railroad , and various companies produce agricultural products were lump together , with the united_states_government as a heavy partner '' . 
had they be truly ruthless , the belgians might have exploit the congolese without compassion . 
but they be not . 
they provide a social_security system which cover all their african employes ; their program of mass medical_care be doubtless the best on the continent ; they put much effort into public housing . 
they also institute a ration system under which all employers in the congo were require to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food . 
but instead of deliver the ration - either in actual commodities or in cash - at intervals of perhaps two_weeks or a month , the belgians feel obliged to dole_out it out more_often . 
would not the children , if they receive all their food on the first day_of_the_month , eat it up immediately , and later go_hungry ? 
the belgians also place great emphasis on education . 
during the 1950 s there be as_many as 25000 schools in the congo . 
but almost all the schools be primary . 
the average congolese can do little more_than puzzle_out the meaning of `` la chatte '' and `` le chien '' and write his name . 
some schools be technical - the belgians need carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and train many . 
but they did not believe_in widespread secondary education , much less in college . 
it be their conviction that the people should be `` bring_up together '' , a grade at_a_time , until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history , economics and political_science . 
indeed , the belgians discourage higher education , fear the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest . 
when the congo receive its independence in 1960 there be , among its 13.5 million people , exactly 14 university graduates . 
why did the belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it ? 
in one large oversimplification , it might be say that the belgians feel , far too late , the gale of nationalism sweep africa . 
they lack time to prepare the congo , as the_british and french had prepare their colonies . 
the congolese were clamor for their independence , even_though most be unsure what it mean ; and in brussels , street crowds shout , `` pas une goutte de sang ! '' 
( not_one drop of blood ! ) 
. 
the belgians would not fight for the privilege of be the detested pedagogue ; rather_than teach where teaching was not want , they would wash_their_hands of the mess . 
it be hard to blame them for this . 
yet there were other motivations and actions which the belgians take after independence for which history may_not find them guiltless . 
as the time for independence approach there were in the congo no_fewer_than 120 political_parties , or approximately eight for each university graduate . 
there were four principal ones . 
first , there were those congolese ( among them joseph_kasavubu ) who favor split the country into small independent states , balkanize it . 
second , there were those ( moise_tshombe ) who favor near-balkanization , a loose federalism have a central government of limited authority , with much power reside in the states . 
third , there were those ( notably patrice_lumumba ) who favor a unified congo with a very strong central government . 
and fourth , there were moderates who be in no hurry for independence and wish to wait until the congo grow_up . 
however , the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shift . 
a final factor which contribute greatly to the fragmentation of the congo , immediately after independence , be the provincial structure that had been establish by the belgians for convenience in administration . 
they had divide the congo into six provinces - leopoldville , kasai , kivu , katanga , equator and eastern - unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings . 
thus some provinces contain tribes which detest each other , and to them independence mean an opportunity for war . 
the belgian_congo was grant its independence with what seem a workable western-style form_of_government : 
there were to be a president and a premier , and a bicameral legislature elect by universal suffrage in the provinces . 
well-wishers around the world hope that the congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations . 
if internal frictions arise , they could be handle by the 25000 - man congolese army , the force_publique , which had been train and was still officer by white belgians . 
the president , joseph_kasavubu , seem an able administrator and the premier , patrice_lumumba , a reasonable man . 
twenty-four_hours after independence the wild tribesmen commence fight each other . 
presently the well-armed members of the force_publique - many_of them draw from savage and even cannibalistic tribes , erupt in mutiny , rioting , raping and looting . 
terror engulf the thousands of belgian civilians who had remain in the country . 
the belgian government decide to act , and on july 10 dispatch paratroops to the congo . 
on july 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of katanga , moise_tshombe , announce that his province had secede from the country . 
confusion become chaos ; each succeeding day bring new acts of violence . 
lumumba and kasavubu blame it all on the military intervention by the belgians , and appeal_to the united_nations to send troops to oust them . 
on july_14 the security_council - with france and great_britain abstain - vote the resolution which draw the u._n. into the congo . 
vague in wording , it call_for withdrawal of belgian troops and authorize the secretary-general `` to take the necessary steps to provide the [ congolese ] government with such military assistance as may be necessary , until , through the efforts of the congolese_government with the technical assistance of the united_nations , the national security_forces may be able , in the opinion of the government , to meet fully their tasks '' . 
secretary-general_hammarskjo ^ ld decide that it would be preferable if the u._n. troops send into the congo were to come from african , or at_least nonwhite , nations - certainly not from the u._s. , russia , great_britain or france . 
he quickly call_on ghana , tunisia , morocco , guinea and mali , which dispatch troops within hours . 
ultimately the u._n. army in the congo reach a top strength of 19000 , include about 5000 from india and a_few soldiers from eire and sweden , who be the only whites . 
it take the u._n. three months to bring a modest form of order to the congo . 
the belgians be reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstruct u._n. efforts . 
the wildly erratic nature of patrice_lumumba cause constant problems - he frequently announce that he want the u._n. to get_out of the congo along with the belgians , and appeal_to russia for help . 
( however , there is little evidence that the late lumumba be a communist . 
before appeal_to the u._n. or to russia , he first appeal_to the u._s. for military help , and was reject . ) 
lumumba further complicate the u. n . 's mission by initiate small `` wars '' with the secessionist province of katanga and with south_kasai which , under albert_kalonji , want to secede as_well . 
meanwhile russia take every opportunity to meddle in the congo , send lumumba equipment for his `` wars '' , dispatch `` technicians '' and even threaten , on_occasion , to intervene openly . 
but by the end of the three-month period , in october 1960 , something approach calm settle on the congo . 
president_kasavubu become exasperated with lumumba and fire him . 
lumumba fire kasavubu . 
control of the government - such control as there was and such government as there was - pass into the hands of joseph_mobutu , chief_of_staff of the congolese army . 
mobutu promptly throw_out the russians , who have not since play any significant part on the local scene , although they have redouble their obstructionist efforts at u._n. headquarters in new_york . 
the belgians - at_least officially - depart from the congo as_well , withdraw all_of their uniformed troops . 
but they leave behind them large_numbers of officers , variously called `` volunteers '' or `` mercenaries '' , who now staff the army of moise_tshombe in katanga , the seceded province which , according to tshombe , hold 65  of the mineral wealth of the entire country . 
from october 1960 to february 1961 , the u._n. forces in the congo take little action . 
there was no directive for it - the security_council 's resolution had not mention political matters , and in_any_case the united_nations by the terms of its charter may_not interfere in the political affairs of any nation , whether to unify it , federalize it or balkanize it . 
during the five-month lull , civil_war smolder and flicker throughout the congo . 
in february the murder of patrice_lumumba , who had been kidnap into katanga and execute on order of tshombe , again stir the u._n. to action . 
on feb. 21 the council pass another resolution urge the taking of `` all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil_war in the congo , include the use of force , if necessary , in the last_resort '' . 
although the resolution might have be far more specific , it be considerably tougher than the earlier one . 
it also urge that the u._n. eject , and prevent the return of , all belgian and other foreign military and political advisers ; order an investigation of lumumba 's death ; urge the reconvention of the congolese_parliament and the reorganization of the army . 
though president_john_f._kennedy be primarily concerned with the crucial problems of berlin and disarmament adviser mccloy 's unexpected report from khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance_on personal diplomacy involve him in other key problems of u._s. foreign_policy last week . 
high_up on the president 's priority list be the thorny question of bizerte . 
on this issue , the president receive a detailed report from his u._n._ambassador_adlai_stevenson , who had just return from paris , and mr._kennedy ask stevenson to search for a face-saving way - for both paris and tunis - out of the imbroglio . 
ideally , the president would like the_french to agree on a `` status_quo ante '' on bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdraw their forces from the mediterranean base . 
to continue their important conversations about the tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , mr._kennedy invite stevenson to cape_cod for the weekend . 
the president also discuss the bizerte deadlock with the no. 2 man in the tunisian_government , defense_minister_bahi_ladgham , who fly to washington last week to seek u._s. support . 
the conversation apparently convince mr._kennedy that the positions of france and tunisia be not irreconcilable . 
through ladgham , mr._kennedy send a message along those lines to tunisian_president_habib_bourguiba ; and one u._s. official say : 
`` the key question now be which side pick_up the phone first '' . 
on the latin_american front , the president hold talks with secretary of the treasury_douglas_dillon before send him to uruguay and the inter-american economic_and_social_council ( which the president himself had originally hope to attend ) . 
main purpose of the meeting : to discuss president_kennedy 's alliance for progress . 
and that be not all . 
in conferences with nationalist_china 's dapper , diminutive vice_president chen_cheng , mr._kennedy assure chiang_kai-shek 's emissary that the u._s. be as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of red_china to the united_nations . 
chen be equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of outer_mongolia ; however the president , who would like to woo the former chinese province away from both peking and moscow , would promise chen nothing more_than an abstention by the u._s. if outer_mongolia 's admission come to a vote . 
the president also confer_with emissaries from guatemala and nepal who are seek more foreign aid . 
to africa , he send his most trusted adviser , his brother , attorney_general robert_kennedy , on a good-will mission to the ivory_coast . 
all week long the president clearly was play a larger personal role in foreign affairs ; in_effect , he was practice what he preach in his berlin message two_weeks ago when he declare : `` we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that be willing to talk , and listen , with_reason '' . 
from international_airport in los_angeles to international_airport in houston , as the great four-jet boeing 707 fly , be a routine five hours and 25 minutes , include stopovers at phoenix , el_paso , and san_antonio . 
when continental airlines night-coach flight 54 take_off at 11 : 30 one night last week , there was no reason to think it would take any longer . 
the plane put_down on schedule at 1 : 35 a. m. in phoenix . 
thirty-one minutes later , when it take_off for el_paso , hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers pay any attention to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard . 
at 3 : 58 a. m. , with the plane about twenty minutes out of el_paso , passenger robert_berry , a san_antonio advertising man , glance up and see the man and boy , accompany by a stewardess , walk up the aisle toward the cockpit . 
`` the man be bent_over with his hand on his stomach '' , berry say . 
`` i figure he be sick '' . 
john_salvador , a farmer from palm_desert , calif. , was sit up front and could see through the door as the trio enter the cockpit . 
`` the kid have a .45 automatic , like they issue in the army '' , he say . 
`` the other fellow have a .38 '' . 
salvador see the youth hold his .45 against the head of stewardess lois_carnegey ; the man put his .38 at the head of capt._byron_d._rickards . 
to rickards , a 52 - year-old veteran 30 years in_the_air , it be an old story : his plane was being hijack in mid-flight again much_as it had happen in 1930 , when peruvian rebels make him land a ford tri-motor at arequipa . 
but last week 's pirates , like the cuban-american who recently hijack an eastern airlines electra ( newsweek , aug. 7 ) , want to go to havana . 
`` tell your company there be four of us here with guns '' , the elder man tell rickards . 
the pilot radio el_paso_international_airport with just that message . 
but , he tell the `` skyjackers '' , the 707 did n't carry enough fuel to reach havana ; they would have to refuel at el_paso . 
most passengers did n't know what had happen until they get on the ground . 
jerry_mccauley of sacramento , calif. , one of some twenty air_force recruits on_board , awake from a nap in confusion . 
`` the old_man come from the front of the plane and say he want four volunteers to go to cuba '' , mccauley say , `` and like a nut i raise my hand . 
i think he be the air_force recruiter '' . 
what the man want be four persons to volunteer as hostages , along with the crew . 
they choose four : 
jack_casey , who work for continental airlines in houston ; fred_mullen from mercer_island , wash. ; pfc._truman_cleveland of st._augustine . 
fla. , and leonard_gilman , a former college boxer and veteran of the u._s._immigration_service border_patrol . 
everybody else was allow to file off the plane after it touch_down at el_paso at 4 : 18 a. m. . 
they find a large welcoming group - el_paso policemen , border_patrol , sheriff 's deputies , and fbi men , who surge around the plane with rifles and submarine guns . 
other fbi men , talk with the pilot from the tower , conspire with him to delay the proposed flight to havana . 
the ground_crew , which ordinarily fuel a 707 in twenty minutes , take fully three hours . 
still more time was consume while the pilot , at the radioed suggestion of continental president robert six , try to persuade the armed pair to swap the boeing jet for a propeller-driven douglas_dc-7 . 
actually , the officers on_the_ground have no intention of let the hijackers get_away with any kind_of an airplane ; they have orders to_that_effect straight from president_kennedy , who think at_first , as did most others , that it be four followers of cuba 's fidel_castro who had take_over the 707 . 
mr._kennedy had been inform early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane , keep in touch throughout by telephone . 
at_one_time , while still under the impression that he was deal with a cuban plot , the president talk_about invoke a total embargo on trade with cuba . 
as the morning wear_on and a blazing west_texas sun wipe the shadows off the franklin mountains , police get close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment . 
from the luggage , they learn that the two air pirates , far from be cubans , be native_americans , subsequently identify as leon_bearden , 50 - year-old ex-convict from coolidge , ariz. , and his son , cody , 16 , a high-school junior . 
the heat and strain begin to tell_on the beardens . 
the father , by_accident or perhaps to show , as he say , `` we mean_business '' , take the .45 and fire a slug between the legs of second officer_norman_simmons . 
at 7 : 30 a. m. , more_than three hours after landing , the beardens give an ultimatum : 
take_off or see the hostages kill . 
the tower clear the plane for take-off at 8 a. m. , and captain_rickards begin taxi toward the runway . 
several police_cars , loaded with armed officers , race alongside , blaze_away at the tires of the big jet . 
the slugs flatten ten tires and silence one of the inboard engines ; the plane slow to a halt . 
ambulances , baggage trucks , and cars surround it . 
the day wear_on . 
at 12 : 50 p. m. a ramp was roll up to the plane . 
a_few minutes later , fbi_agent francis_crosby , talk fast , ease_up the ramp to the plane , unarmed . 
while crosby distract the beardens , stewardesses carnegey and toni_besset drop out of a rear door . 
so did hostages casey , cleveland , and mullen . 
that leave only the four crew_members , crosby , and border_patrolman gilman , all unarmed , with the beardens . 
the elder bearden have one pistol in his hand , the other in a hip_pocket . 
gilman start talk to him until he see his chance . 
he catch officer simmons ' eye , nod toward young bearden , and - `` i swing my right as hard as i could . 
simmons and crosby jump the boy and it be all_over '' . 
frogmarch off the airplane at 1 : 48 p. m. , the beardens were hold in bail of $ 100000 each on charges of kidnapping and transport a stolen plane across state_lines . 
( bearden reportedly hope to peddle the plane to castro , and live high in cuba . ) 
back home in coolidge , ariz. , his 36 - year-old wife , mary , say : 
`` i think they were go to phoenix to look_for jobs '' . 
take precedence over all other legislation on capitol_hill last week was the military strength of the nation . 
the senate put other business aside as it move with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass - 85 to 0 - the largest peacetime defense budget in u._s. history . 
with the money all_but in_hand , however , the administration indicate that , instead of the 225000 more men in uniform that president_kennedy had request , the armed_forces would be increase by only 160000 . 
the `` hold-back '' , as pentagon mutterers label it , apparently be a temporary_expedient intend to insure that the army services are build_up gradually and , thus , the new funds spend prudently . 
in_all , the senate sign a check for $ 46.7 billion , which not_only include the extra $ 3.5 billion request the week before by president_kennedy , but tack_on $ 754 million more_than the president had ask for . 
( the senate , on its own , decide to provide additional b-52 and other long-range bombers for the strategic_air_command . ) 
the house , which had pass its smaller appropriation before the president 's urgent call for more , was expect to go_along with the increased defense budget in_short_order . 
in other areas , congressional action last week include : 
the senate ( by voice vote ) and the house ( by 224 - 170 ) pass and send to the white_house the compromise farm_bill which the president is expect to sign , not too unhappily . 
the senate also vote $ 5.2 billion to finance the government 's health , welfare , and labor activities . 
debate on the all-important foreign-aid bill , with its controversial long-range proposals , had just begin on the senate floor at the weekend . 
white_house legislative aides be still confident the bill would pass intact . 
most members of the u._s._senate , because they be human , like to eat as high on the hog as they can . 
but , because they be politicians , they like to talk as poor-mouth as the lowliest voter . 
as a result , ever since 1851 when the senate restaurant open in the new wing of the capitol_building , the senators have never cease to grumble about the food - even while they oppose every move that might improve it . 
over the years , enliven chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of maine and idaho potatoes , the menu has pursue its drab all-american course . 
individual senators , with an eye to the voters back home , occasionally introduce smelts from michigan , soft-shell_crabs from maryland , oysters from washington , grapefruit from florida . 
but plain old bean soup , serve daily since the turn_of_the_century ( at the insistence of the late sen._fred_dubois of idaho ) , make clear to the citizenry that the senate 's stomach be in the right place . 
in a daring stroke , the senate venture forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hire a $ 10000 - per-year french-born maitre d ' hotel . 
holders of toll-road bonds are find improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes . 
long-term trend of traffic on these roads seem clearly upward . 
higher toll rates also are help boost revenues . 
result be a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regard_as highly speculative . 
things are looking_up these days for many_of the state turnpikes on_which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds . 
traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been grow . 
that added traffic mean rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates . 
as a result of the new outlook for turnpikes , investors who buy toll-road bonds when these securities rank as outright speculations are now find new hope for their investments . 
another result be that buyers are tend to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds . 
other tax-exempt bonds of state and local_governments hit a price peak on february 21 , according to standard + poor 's average . 
on balance , prices of those bonds have slip a_bit since then . 
however , in the same three-month period , toll-road bonds , as_a_group , have buck this trend . 
on these bonds , price rises since february 21 easily outnumber price declines . 
investors , however , still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bonds . 
you find the evidence of_that in the chart on this page . 
many_of the toll-road bonds still are sell at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per_cent , or very close_to that . 
and this be true in the case of some turnpikes on_which revenues have rise close_to , or beyond , the point at which the roads start to pay all operating_costs plus annual interest on the bonds . 
that 4 per_cent yield be well below the return to be have on good corporation bonds . 
it be not_much more , in_fact , than the return that is offer on u._s. treasury_bonds . 
for investors whose income is tax at high rates , though , a tax-free yield of 4 per_cent be high . 
it be the equivalent of 8 per_cent for an unmarried investor with more_than $ 16000 of income to be tax , or for a married_couple with more_than $ 32000 of taxed income . 
a new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the_most recent 12 - month period - end in february or march - show what is happen . 
the report is base on a survey by blyth + company , investment_bankers . 
nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period . 
and there is the bright note : the gains were achieve in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession . 
many_of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter . 
indication : the long-term trend of turnpike traffic be upward . 
look , for_example , at the ohio_turnpike . 
traffic on_that road slump sharply in january and february , as compare with those same months in 1960 . 
then march bring an 18 per_cent rise in net revenues - after operating_costs . 
as a result , the road 's net revenues in the 12 months end march 31 be 186 per_cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds . 
that be up from 173 per_cent in the preceding 12 months . 
that same pattern of earnings show_up on the massachusetts_turnpike . 
operating revenues be off in the first three months of 1961 , but up for the 12 months end in march . 
costs were hold down , despite a bitter winter . 
for the year , the road earn 133 per_cent of its interest costs , against 121 per_cent in the preceding period . 
the road 's engineers look_for further improvement when the turnpike is extend into boston . 
some turnpikes have not be in full operation long enough to prove what they can do . 
the 187 - mile illinois_state toll highway , for_example , was not open over its entire length until december , 1958 . 
in the 12 months end in february , 1960 , the highway earn enough to cover 64 per_cent of its interest load - with the remainder pay_out of initial reserves . 
in the 12 months end in february , 1961 , this highway earn 93 per_cent of its interest . 
that improvement is continue . 
in the first two months of 1961 , earnings of the illinois highway available for interest payments be up 55 per_cent from early 1960 . 
success , for many turnpikes , has come hard . 
traffic frequently has fail to measure_up to engineers ' rosy estimates . 
in these cases , the turnpike managements have have to turn_to toll-rate increases , or to costly improvements such_as extensions or better connections with other highways . 
many rate increases already have been put into effect . 
higher tolls are plan for july_1 , 1961 , on the richmond-petersburg , va. , turnpike , and proposals for increased tolls on the texas_turnpike be under study . 
progress is being make , too , in improve motorists ' access to many turnpikes . 
the kansas_turnpike offer an illustration . 
net earnings of_that road rise from 62 per_cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per_cent in the 12 months end feb. 28 , 1961 . 
further improvements in earnings of the kansas_turnpike are expect late in 1961 , with the opening of a new bypass at wichita , and still later when the turnpike get downtown connections in both kansas_city , kans. , and kansas_city , mo. . 
meanwhile , there appear to be enough money in the road 's reserve_fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years . 
investors study the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are near their goals . 
traffic and revenues on the chicago_skyway have be a great disappointment to planners and investors alike . 
if nothing is do , the prospect be that that road will be in default of interest in 1962 . 
west_virginia toll bonds have default in interest for months , and , despite recent improvement in revenues , holders of the bonds are face with more of the same . 
these , however , be exceptions . 
the typical picture at this time be one of steady improvement . 
it 's going_to take time for investors to learn how many_of the toll-road bonds will pay_out in full . 
already , however , several of the turnpikes are earn enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins . 
many others are attract the traffic need to push revenues up_to the break-even point . 
a top american official , after a look at europe 's factories , think the u._s. be in a `` very serious situation '' competitively . 
commerce_secretary_luther_hodges , accompany by a member of our staff , on may 10 tour plants of two of italy 's biggest companies - fiat , the auto producer , and olivetti , maker of typewriters and calculating_machines . 
our staff man cable from turin as_follows - 
`` follow secretary_hodges through the fiat plant , and you learn this : 
`` one , modern equipment - much of_it supply under the marshall_plan - enable fiat to turn_out 2100 cars a day . 
about half of these are export . 
`` two , wage costs be a fraction of the u._s. costs . 
a skilled_worker on the assembly_line , for_example , earn $ 37 a week . 
`` three , labor troubles be infrequent . 
fiat officials say they have have no strikes for more_than six years . 
`` say secretary_hodges : ' it be a tough combination for the u._s. to face ' . 
`` olivetti have a special interest for hodges . 
olivetti take_over underwood , the u._s. typewriter maker , in late 1959 . 
within a year , without reduce wages , underwood 's production_costs were cut one third , prices were slash . 
the result has be that exports of underwood products have double . 
`` the olivetti plant near turin have modern layout , modern machinery . 
the firm be design-conscious , sales-conscious , advertising-conscious . 
`` hodges is try to get more foreign business to go_to the u._s. . 
the inflow of foreign capital would help the u._s. balance_of_payments . 
`` hodges predict : ' i think we will see more foreign firms come to the u._s. . 
there are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas '' ' . 
foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that washington is explore new ways of handle competitive imports . 
the recently unveiled kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for american businessmen in many lines . 
important aspects of the kennedy textile plans be these : 
an international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be call shortly by president_kennedy . 
chief aims of the proposed conference be worth note . 
the u._s. will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years . 
point be that developing countries often build_up a textile industry first , need encouragement to get on their feet . 
if they have trouble export , international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would . 
idea be to let these countries earn their way as_much_as_possible . 
at_the_same_time , another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports - especially dumping of specific products - to high-wage textile-producing countries . 
japan , since 1957 , has been `` voluntarily '' curb exports of textiles to the u._s. . 
hong_kong , india and pakistan have been limit exports of certain types of textiles to britain for several years under the `` lancashire_pact '' . 
none of these countries be happy with these arrangements . 
the japanese want to increase exports to the u._s. while they have been curb shipments , they have watch hong_kong step_in and capture an expanding share of the big u._s. market . 
hong_kong interests loudly protest limit their exports to britain , while spanish and portuguese textiles pour into british market unrestrictedly . 
the indians and pakistanis are chafe under similar restrictions on the_british market for similar reasons . 
the kennedy hope be that , at the conference or through bilateral talks , the low-wage textile-producing countries in asia and europe will see that `` dumping '' practices cause friction all_around and may result in import quotas . 
gradual , controlled expansion of the world 's textile trade be what president_kennedy want . 
this may point_the_way toward international stabilization agreements in other products . 
it be an important clue to washington thinking . 
note , too , that the kennedy textile plan look toward modernization or shrinkage of the u._s. textile industry . 
`` get competitive or get_out '' . 
in veiled terms , that be what the kennedy_administration is say to the american textile industry . 
the government will help in transfer companies and workers into new_lines , where modernization does n't seem feasible . 
special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allow . 
government research will look_into new products and methods . 
import quotas are n't rule_out where the national interest is involve . 
but the kennedy_administration does n't favor import quotas . 
rather , they be impressed with the_british government 's success in force - and help - the_british textile industry to shrink and to change_over to other products . 
what 's happen in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines have difficulty compete with imports from low-wage countries . 
among the highest-paid workers in the world are u._s. coal_miners . 
yet u._s. coal be cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers ' mouths water . 
steel_company of wales , a british steelmaker , want to bring_in virginia coal , cut_down on its takings of welsh coal in_order_to be able to compete more effectively - especially in foreign markets . 
virginia coal , deliver by ship in wales , will be about $ 2.80 a ton cheaper than welsh coal deliver by rail from nearby mines . 
u._s. coal be cheap , despite high wages , because of widespread mechanization of mines , wide coal_seams , attactive rates on ocean freight . 
many_of the coal_seams in the nationalized british mines be twisting , narrow and very deep . 
productivity of u._s. miners be twice that of the_british . 
welsh coal_miners , communist-led , be up in arms at the suggestion that the steel_company bring_in american coal . 
they threaten to strike . 
the_british government will have to decide whether to let u._s. coal in . 
the_british coal_industry be unprofitable , have large coal stocks it can n't sell . 
every library borrower , or at_least those whose taste go beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , know what it be to hear the librarian say apologetically , `` i be sorry , but we do n't have that book . 
there would n't be much demand for it , i be afraid '' . 
behind this reply , and its many variations , be the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest . 
what to buy out of the year 's grist of nearly 15000 book titles ? 
what to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants be incredibly diversified , when your budget be pitifully small ? 
most library budgets be hopelessly inadequate . 
a startlingly high percentage do not exceed $ 500 annually , which include the librarian 's salary , and not even the new_york public have enough money to meet its needs - this in the world 's richest city . 
the plight of a small community library be proportionately worse . 
confront with this situation , most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have , or_else depend_on the bounty of patrons and local_governments to supplement their annual funds . 
in some parts of the country , however , a co-operative movement has begin to grow , under the wing of state_governments , whereby , with the financial help of the state , libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis . 
new_york state have what be probably the_most advanced of these co-operative systems , so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow . 
because it be so large a state , with marked contrasts in population density , the organization of the new_york co-operative offer a cross-section of how the plan work . 
at one extreme be the systems of upper new_york state , where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large , sparsely populated area . 
at the other be organizations like the newly formed nassau_library_system , in a high-density area , with ample resources and a rapidly grow territory to serve . 
both these types , and those in_between , be in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that begin at albany as early as 1950 , with the creation by the legislature of county library systems finance by county governments with matching funds from the state . 
it be a step in the right direction , but it take an additional act pass in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today . 
under this law annual grants are give to systems in substantial amounts . 
an earlier difficulty was overcome by make it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not , as they see fit . 
some library boards be wary of the plan . 
a large , well-stocked library , surrounded in a county by smaller ones , may feel that the demands on its resources be likely to be too great . 
a small library may cherish its independence and established ways , and resist join in a cooperative movement that sometimes seem radical to older members of the board . 
within a system , however , the autonomy of each member library is preserve . 
the local community maintain responsibility for the financial support of its own library_program , facilities , and services , but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system . 
all services are give without cost to members . 
so obvious be these advantages that nearly 95 per_cent of the population of new_york state now have access to a system , and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day , not too distant , when all the libraries in the state will belong_to a co-op . 
to set_up a co-operative library system , the law require a central book collection of 100000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus , and the system is organize around it . 
the collection may be in an existing library , or it may be build up in a central collection . 
each system develop differently , according to the area it serve , but the universal goal be to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency . 
the basic state grant be thirty cents for_each_person serve , and there is a further book incentive grant that provide an extra twenty cents up_to fifty cents per_capita , if a library spend a certain number of dollars . 
in nassau_county , for_example , the heavily settled long_island suburb of new_york_city , the system is credit by the state with serve one million persons , a figure that has double since 1950 . 
this system , by virtue of its variety and size , offer an inclusive view of the plan in_operation . 
the nassau system recognize that its major task it to broaden reference service , what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge , and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area . 
the need be for reference_works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries , adequate_to satisfy everyday needs , could afford . 
nassau is currently build a central collection of reference materials in its hempstead headquarters , which will reach its goal of 100000 volumes by 1965 . 
the major part of_this collection be in the central headquarters building , and the remainder is divide among five libraries in the system designate as subject centers . 
basic reference tools be the backbone of the collection , but there is also specialization in science and technology , an indicated weakness in local libraries . 
on microfilm , headquarters also have a file of the new_york times from its founding in 1851 to the present day , as_well as bound volumes of important periodicals . 
the entire headquarters collection be available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans . 
headquarters get about 100 requests every_day . 
it is connect by teletype with the state_library in albany , which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide . 
the books are carry around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries . 
each subject center library was choose because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area , which headquarters could then build upon . 
east_meadow have philosophy , psychology , and religion ; freeport house social_science , pure science , and language ; history , biography , and education be centered in hempstead ; levittown have applied_science , business , and literature ; while hewlett-woodmere be the repository of art , music , and foreign languages . 
the reference coordinator at headquarters also serve as a consultant , and be available to work with the local librarian in help to strengthen local reference service . 
this kind_of cooperation be not wholly new , of_course . 
public libraries in nassau_county have been lend books to each other by mail for a quarter-century , but the system enable this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis . 
local libraries find , too , that the new plan save tax dollars because books can be buy through the system , and since the system buy in bulk it be able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library . 
the system pass_on these savings to its members . 
further money is save through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing . 
books be not the only resource of the system . 
schools and community groups turn_to the headquarters film library for documentary , art , and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs , and to organizations in member communities . 
the_most recent film catalogue , available at each library , list 110 titles presently in the collection , any of_which may be borrow without charge . 
this catalogue list separately films suitable for children , young adults , or adults , although some classics cut_across age_groups , such_as `` nanook of the north '' , `` the emperor 's nightingale '' , and `` the red_balloon '' . 
workshops are conduct by the system 's audio-visual consultant for the staffs of member libraries , teach them the effective use of film as a library service . 
the system well understand that one of its primary responsibilities be to bring_together children and books together ; consequently an experienced children 's librarian at headquarters conduct a guidance program design to promote well-planned library activities , cooperate with the children 's librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences , workshops , and frequent visits . 
headquarters has also set_up a central juvenile book-review and book-selection center , to provide better methods of purchasing and selection . 
sample copies of new books be on display at headquarters , where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups . 
story hours , pre-school programs , activities with community agencies , and lists of recommended reading be all_in the province of the children 's consultant . 
headquarters of the nassau system be an increasingly busy place these days , threaten to expand beyond its boundaries . 
in_addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children 's program , headquarters have a public_relations director who seek to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county ; it prepare cooperative displays ( posters , booklists , brochures , and other promotional_material ) for use in member libraries ; it maintain a central exhibit collection to share displays already create and use ; and it publish sum and substance , a monthly newsletter , which report the system 's activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries . 
the system itself is govern by a board_of_trustees , geographically represent its membership . 
in nassau , as in other systems , the long-range objective be to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear_on the schools , and on adult education in_general . 
librarians , a patient breed of men and women who have bear much with dedication , can begin to see results today . 
library use is multiply daily , and the bulk of the newcomers be those maligned americans , the teen-agers . 
to them especially the librarians , with the help of co-ops , hope they will never have to say , `` i be sorry , we do n't have that book '' . 
today , more_than ever before , the survival of our free society depend_upon the citizen who be both informed and concerned . 
the great advances make in recent years in communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the western world . 
the need for lifetime reading be apparent . 
education must_not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives , for it be only through knowledge that we , as a nation , can cope_with the dangers that threaten our society . 
the desire and ability to read be important aspects of our cultural life . 
we cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read ; if we are not discriminate in our reading ; if we do not know how to use what we do read . 
we must_not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age , as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that come from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorb from the written word . 
a fundamental source of knowledge in the world today be the book find in our libraries . 
although progress has been make in america 's system of libraries it still fall_short_of what be required if we are to maintain the standards that be needed for an informed america . 
the problem grow in intensity each_year as man 's knowledge , and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word , continue to expand . 
the inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition . 
there are , for_example , approximately 25000000 people in_this country with no public library service and about 50000000 with inadequate service . 
in college libraries , 57 per_cent of the total number of books are own by 124 of 1509 institutions survey last year by the u._s._office of education . 
and over 66 per_cent of the elementary_schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at_all . 
in every aspect of service - to the public , to children in schools , to colleges and universities - the library of today is fail to render vitally needed services . 
only public understanding and support can provide that service . 
this be one of the main reasons for national_library_week , april 16 - 22 , and for its theme : `` for a richer , fuller life , read '' ! 
the general_assembly , which adjourn today , has perform in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle from the day it convene . 
it was face immediately with a showdown on the schools , an issue which was meet squarely in conjunction with the governor with a decision not to risk abandon public education . 
there follow the historic appropriations and budget fight , in_which the general_assembly decide to tackle executive powers . 
the final_decision go to the executive but a way has been open for strengthen budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information they need . 
long-range planning of programs and ways to finance them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid crisis-to-crisis government . 
this session , for_instance , may have insure a financial crisis two years from now . 
in_all the turmoil , some good legislation was pass . 
some other good bills were lose in the shuffle and await future action . 
certainly all can applaud passage of an auto title law , the school bills , the increase in teacher pensions , the ban on drag racing , acceptance by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate as outside city_limits , repeal of the college age limit law and the road maintenance bond issue . 
no action has been take , however , on such major problems as end the fee system , penal reform , modification of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks sales . 
only a token start was make in attack the tax reappraisal question and its companion issue of attract industry to the state . 
the legislature expend most_of its time on the schools and appropriations questions . 
fortunately it spare us from the usual spate of silly resolutions which in_the_past have make georgia look_like anything but `` the empire_state_of_the_south '' . 
we congratulate the entire membership on its record of good legislation . 
in the interim between now and next year , we trust the house and senate will put their minds to study georgia 's very real economic , fiscal and social problems and come_up with answers without all the political heroics . 
the league of women voters , 40 now and admit it proudly , is invite financial contributions in the windup of its fund drive . 
it be a good use of money . 
these women whose organization grow out of the old suffrage movement be dedicated_to thomas_jefferson 's dictum that one must cherish the people 's spirit but `` keep alive their attention '' . 
`` if once they become inattentive_to the public affairs '' , jefferson say , `` you and i , and congress and assemblies , judges and governors , shall all become wolves '' . 
newspapermen and politicians especially be aware_of the penetrating attention and expert analysis the league give to public affairs . 
the league workers search out the pros and cons of the_most complex issues and make them available to the public . 
the harder the choice , the more willing the league be to wade in . 
and the league take a stand , with great regularity , on_the_side of_right . 
cities and counties interested in industrial development would do_well in the months ahead to keep their eyes peeled toward the 13 northwest georgia counties that be members of the coosa_valley_area_planning and development_commission . 
couple its own budget of $ 83750 with a $ 30000 state grant authorize by gov._vandiver , the group expect to sign a contract in march with georgia_tech. . 
then a full-time planning office will be establish in rome to work with a five-member georgia_tech research_staff for development of an area planning and industrial development program . 
the undertaking have abundant promise . 
it recognize the fact that what help one county help its neighbors and that by band_together in an area-wide effort better results can be accomplish than through the go-it-alone approach . 
the rusk belief in balanced defense , replace the dulles theory of massive retaliation , remove a grave danger that has exist . 
the danger lie_in not in believe that our own a-bombs would deter russia 's use of hers ; that theory be and be sound . 
the danger lie_in the american delusion that nuclear deterrence be enough . 
by limit american strength too_much to nuclear strength , this country limit its ability to fight any kind_of war besides a nuclear war . 
this strategy heighten the possibility that we would have a nuclear war . 
it also weaken our diplomatic stance , because russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear war except in the ultimate extremity . 
this leave the soviets plenty of leeway to start low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable impunity . 
by maintain the nuclear deterrent , but gear american military_forces to fight conventional wars too , secretary_of_state rusk junk bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and build more muscle and greater safety into our military position . 
dekalb 's budget for 1961 be a record one and carry with_it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance . 
it include a raise in the county minimum_wage , creation of several new jobs at the executive level , financing of beefed-up industrial development efforts , and increased expenditures for essential services such_as health and welfare , fire protection , sanitation and road maintenance . 
that such expansion can be obtain without a raise in taxes be_due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal planning on the part of the board of commissioners , head by chairman_charles_o._emmerich who is demonstrate that the public trust he was give be well placed , and other county officials . 
g._mennen_williams is learn the difficulties of diplomacy rapidly . 
tour africa , the new u._s. assistant secretary_of_state observe `` africa should be for the africans '' and the_british promptly denounce him . 
then he arrive in zanzibar and find africans carry signs say `` american imperialists , go_home '' . 
chin_up , soapy . 
confidence in the state 's economic future is reflect in the georgia power_company 's record construction budget for this year . 
the firm do a large amount of research and its forecasts have meaning . 
it be good to know that georgia will continue to have sufficient electrical_power not_only to meet the demands of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of industrialization . 
georgia 's mental_health program receive a badly needed boost from the general_assembly in the form of a $ 1750000 budget increase for the milledgeville_state_hospital . 
actually it amount to $ 1250000 above what the institution already is receive , consider the additional half-million dollars gov._vandiver allocate last year from the state surplus . 
either way it sound like a sizable hunk of money and be . 
but exactly how far it will go toward improve conditions be another question because there be so_much that need doing . 
the practice of charge employes for meals whether they eat at the hospital or not should be abolish . 
the work week of attendants who be on_duty 65 hours and more per week should be reduce . 
more attendants , nurses and doctors should be hire . 
patients deserve more attention than they are get . 
even with the increase in funds for the next fiscal_year , georgia will be spend only around $ 3.15 per day per patient . 
the national average be more_than $ 4 and that figure is consider by experts in the mental_health field to be too low . 
kansas , regard_as tops in the nation in its treatment of the mentally_ill , spend $ 9 per day per patient . 
georgia has make some reforms , true . 
the intensive treatment program is work well . 
but in so many other areas we still are drag . 
consider what is being do compare to what need to be do , it behoove the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning toward making the best possible use of the increase granted . 
the boost be helpful but inadequate . 
assassination , even of a tyrant , be repulsive to men of good conscience . 
rafael_trujillo , the often-blood thirsty dictator of the dominican_republic for 31 years , perhaps deserve his fate in an even-handed appraisal of history . 
but whether the murder of el_benefactor in ciudad_trujillo mean freedom for the people of the caribbean fiefdom be a question that cannot now be answer . 
trujillo know a great_deal about assassination . 
the responsibility for scores of deaths , include the abduction and murder of jesus_maria_galindez , a professor at columbia_university in new_york , has been lay at his door . 
he had be involved in countless schemes to do_away_with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such_as president_romulo_betancourt of venezuela . 
it be a sort_of poetic_justice that at_the_time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow the venezuelan government , reportedly involve the use of dominican arms by former venezuelan dictator_marcos_perez_jimenez , has been uncover and quash . 
the recent history of the dominican_republic be an almost classical study of the way in_which even a professedly benevolent dictatorship tend to become oppressive . 
unquestionably trujillo do some good things for his country : he improve public facilities such_as roads and sanitation , attract industry and investment and raise the standard_of_living notably . 
but the price be the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition . 
el_benefactor 's vanity grow with his personal wealth . 
the jails be filled to overflowing_with political_prisoners who had incur his displeasure . 
he maintain amply financed lobbies in the united_states and elsewhere which sycophantically chant his praise , and his influence extend even to congress . 
until the last year or_so the profession of friendship with the united_states had be an article of faith with trujillo , and altogether too often this profession was accept here as evidence of his good character . 
tardily the government here come to understand how this country 's own reputation was tarnish by the association with repression . 
last year , after trujillo had been cite for numerous aggressions in the caribbean , the united_states and many other members of the organization_of_american_states break diplomatic relations with him . 
thereupon follow a demonstration that tyranny know no ideological confines . 
trujillo 's dictatorship had be along conservative , right-wing lines . 
but after the censure he and his propaganda start mouth communist slogans . 
there be considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with castro in cuba , previously a bete_noire to trujillo - thus illustrate the way in_which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesce . 
what come_after trujillo be now the puzzle . 
the dominican people have know no democratic institutions and precious little freedom for a generation , and all alternative leadership has been suppress . 
perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability , but the vacuum of free institutions create a great danger . 
the dominican_republic could turn toward communist-type authoritarianism as easily as toward western freedom . 
such a twist would be a tragedy for the dominican people , who deserve to breathe without_fear . 
for that reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative government to the dominican_republic will need the greatest sympathy and help . 
high-speed buses on the george_washington memorial_parkway , operate between downtown washington and cabin_john , glen_echo and brookmont , would constitute an alluring sample of_what the new national_capital transportation_agency can do for this city . 
in present plans for such express_buses before the montgomery_county_council , the administrator of the ncta , c._darwin_stolzenbach , was frankly seek support for the projects his agency will soon be launch . 
such support should not be difficult to come_by if all the plans to be present by the ncta be as attractive as this outline of express_buses come into the downtown area . 
because the buses would not stop on the parkway , land for bus_stations and for parking_areas nearby will be need . 
the ncta be well-advised to seek funds for this purpose from the present session of congress . 
the inference has been too widely accept that because the communists have succeed in build barricades across berlin the free_world must acquiesce in dismemberment of_that living city . 
so_far as the record be concerned , the western powers have not acquiesce and should not do so . 
though walter_ulbricht , by grace of soviet tanks , may be head man in east_germany , that does not give him any right to usurp the government of east_berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the soviet zone . 
the wartime protocol of september 12 , 1944 , designate a special `` greater_berlin '' area , comprise the entire city , to be under joint occupation . 
it be not a part of any one of the three ( later four ) zones for occupation by soviet , american , british , and french troops respectively . 
after the berlin blockade and airlift , the council of foreign_ministers in 1949 declare a purpose `` to mitigate the effects of the present administrative_division of germany and of berlin '' . 
for_some_time the communists honor the distinction between the soviet zone of germany and the soviet sector of berlin by promulgate separately the laws for the two areas . 
then they move offices of the east_german puppet government into east_berlin and begin illegally to treat it as the capital of east_germany . 
that this and the closing of the east_berlin-west_berlin border have not been accept by the western governments appear in notes which britain , france , and the united_states send to moscow after the latter 's gratuitous protest over a visit of chancellor_adenauer and other west german officials to west_berlin . 
the chancellor have as much business there as ulbricht have in east_berlin - and be certainly less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of gerhard_eisler . 
the_british and other replies to_that moscow note point_out efforts of the communist authorities `` to integrate east_berlin into east_germany by isolate it from_the_outside and attempt to make it the capital of east_germany '' . 
they insist on the `` fundamental fact '' that `` the whole of berlin have a quadripartite status '' . 
this be far from acknowledge or recognize those efforts as an accomplished_fact . 
there remain , of_course , the question of_what the west can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from become accomplished_facts . 
one ground of action certainly exist when fusillades of stray shots go over into west_berlin as communist `` vopos '' try to gun_down fleeing unarmed residents . 
another remain when an american_army car was recover but with a broken glass . 
the glass may seem trivial but communist official hooliganism feed_on such incidents unless they are redress . 
remember the step-by-step fate of danzig and the west german misgivings about `` salami '' tactics , it be to be hope that the dispatch of general_clay to west_berlin as president_kennedy 's representative will mark a stiffening of response not_only to future indignities and aggressions but also to some that have pass . 
thousands of buffalo ( `` bison '' they will never be to the man on the street ) graze like a mobile brown throw-rug upon the rolling , dusty-green grassland . 
a_horizon even and seamless , bind the vast sun-bleached dome of sky to earth . 
that picture of the american prairie is as indelibly fix in the memory of those who have study the conquest of the american continent as any later cinema image of the west make in live-oak canyons near hollywood . 
for it be the millions of buffalo and prairie_chicken and the endless seas of grass that symbolize for a whole generation of americans the abundant supply that was to take many_of them westward when the ohio and mississippi valleys begin to fill . 
the national_park service now propose to preserve an area in pottawatomie_county , northeast kansas , as a `` prairie national_park '' . 
there the buffalo would roam , to be see as a tapestry , not as moth-eaten zoo specimens . 
wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be save . 
grasslands would extend , unfenced , unplowed , unbroken by silo or barn - as the first settlers see them . 
the park_service makes an impressive ecological and statistical case for create this new park . 
american history should clinch the case when congress is ask to approve . 
a philadelphia distiller is currently breach the customary prohibition against hard-liquor advertising on tv and radio . 
start with small stations not members of the national_association of broadcasters , the firm apparently is seek to break_down the anti-liquor barriers in major-market stations . 
probably the best answer to this kind_of entering wedge be congressional action require the federal communications commission to ban such advertising through its licensing power . 
the national_association of broadcasters code specifically bar hard-liquor commercials . 
past polls of public_opinion show popular favor for this policy . 
even the distilled_spirits_institute has long have a specific prohibition . 
why , then , with these voluntary barricades and some state laws bar liquor ads , be it necessary to seek congressional action ? 
simply because the subverting action of firms that be not members of the distilled_spirits_institute and of radio and tv_stations that be not members of the nab tend to spread . 
soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly from the efforts of non-code competitors . 
although the false glamour surround bourbon or other whisky commercials be possibly no_more fatuous than the pseudo-sophistication with which tv soft-drinks are down or toothpaste apply , there is a sad difference between entice a viewer into sip oopsie-cola and gull him into down bourbon . 
a law be needed . 
registered democrats in new_york_city this year have the opportunity to elect their party 's candidates for mayor and other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization . 
in the central contest , that for mayor , they may have find some pertinent points in_what each faction has say about the other . 
mayor_robert_f._wagner must , as his opponents demand , assume responsibility for his performance in office . 
while all citizens share_in blame for lax municipal ethics the wagner regime has see serious problems in the schools , law_enforcement and fiscal policies . 
the mayor is find it awkward to campaign against his own record . 
state_controller_arthur_levitt , on_the_other_hand , cannot effectively deny that he has choose to be the candidate of those party leaders who as a rule have show livelier interest in political power than in the city 's welfare . 
they , too , have links with the city 's ills . 
both men are know to be honest and public-spirited . 
mayor_wagner 's shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly expose than those of mr._levitt who leave an impression of quiet competence in his more protected state post . 
as mayor , mr._levitt might turn_out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters would like . 
his election , on_the_other_hand , would unquestionably strengthen the `` regulars '' . 
mr._wagner might or might not be a `` new '' mayor in_this third term , now that he be free_of the pressure of those party leaders whom he call `` bosses '' . 
these be , of_course , the same people whose support he has only now reject to seek the independent vote . 
but his reelection would strengthen the liberal democrats and the labor_unions who back him . 
if this choice be less exciting than new_york democrats may wish , it nevertheless must be make . 
the vote still give citizens a voice in the operation of their government and their party . 
both mr._k 's have so_far continue to speak softly and carry big sticks over laos . 
president_kennedy , already two quiet demands down , still refuse thursday to be draw into deliver a public ultimatum to moscow . 
but at_the_same_time he move his helicopter-borne marines to within an hour of the fighting . 
and secretary_rusk , en_route to bangkok , doubtless is try to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of australian or thai_seato forces . 
for mr._kennedy , speak softly and carry a sizable stick is make the best of a bad situation . 
the new president be in no position to start_out his dealings with moscow by issue callable bluffs . 
he must show at the outset that he mean exactly what he say . 
in_this case he has put the alternatives clearly to mr._khrushchev for the third time . 
at his press_conference mr._kennedy say , `` all we want in laos be peace not war . 
a truly neutral government not a cold_war pawn '' . 
at the scene he has just_as clearly show his military strength in unprovocative but ready position . 
since laos be of no_more purely military value to moscow itself than it be to washington , this approach might be expect to head_off mr._khrushchev for_the_moment . 
but because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in laos , the soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride - a course that would appear to cost him little on_the_spot , but would bog washington in a tactical mess . 
as wars go , laos be an extremely little one . 
casualties have been run about a dozen men a day . 
the hard core of the pro-communist rebel force number only some 2000 tough viet_minh guerrilla fighters . 
but for the united_states and its seato allies to attempt to shore_up a less tough , less combat-tested government army in monsoon-shrouded , road-shy , guerrilla-th ' - wisp terrain be a risk not savor by pentagon planners . 
but if anything can bring_home to mr._khrushchev the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment from watch this braddock-against-the-indians contest , it will probably be the fact that seato forces be ready to attempt it - plus the fact that moscow have something to lose from close_off disarmament and other bigger negotiations with washington . 
fortunately both the republicans and america 's chief western allies now are join behind the neutral laos aim of the president . 
actually it would be more accurate to say that the leader of the alliance now has swing fully behind the_british policy of seek to achieve a neutral laos via the international bargaining table . 
it be ironic that washington is have to struggle so for a concept that for six years it bypass as unreasonable . 
the state_department tacitly reject the neutral laos idea after the geneva conference of 1954 , and last year washington back the rightist coup that oust neutral premier_souvanna_phouma . 
but since last fall the united_states has been move toward a pro-neutralist position and now be ready to back the_british plan for a cease-fire patrol by outside observers and follow by a conference of interested powers . 
the road to a guaranteed-neutral , coup-proof laos be today almost as difficult as warfare on_that nation 's terrain . 
but for the safety of southeast_asia , and for the sake of the laotian people - who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority now engage in the fighting - this last big effort to seal that country from the cold_war have to be make . 
the world await mr._khrushchev 's choice of alternatives . 
the senate 's overwhelming ( 64 - 13 ) vote to support locally controlled educational tv efforts should be emulate in the lower house . 
twice previously the senate has approve measures back etv and the house has let f die . 
but f year prospects may be better . 
the house communications subcommittee is expect to report_out a good bill call_for the states to match federal funds . 
this year 's senate measure would provide each state and the district_of_columbia with $ 1000000 to be use in support of private , state , or municipal etv efforts . 
the funds would be use for equipment , not for land , buildings , or operation . 
the relatively few communities that have educational stations have find them of considerable value . 
but , lack money from commercial sponsors , the stations have have difficulties meet expenses or improve their service . 
other communities - the ones to be aid most by the senate bill - have have difficulty start such stations because of the high initial cost of equipment . 
sam_rayburn be a good man , a good american , and , third , a good democrat . 
he be all_of these rolled into one sturdy figure ; mr._speaker , mr._sam , and mr._democrat , at one_and_the_same time . 
the house be his habitat and there he flourish , first as a young representative , then as a forceful committee chairman , and finally in the post for which he seem intended from birth , speaker of the house , and second most powerful man in washington . 
mr._rayburn be not an easy man to classify or to label . 
he be no flaming liberal , yet the new_deal , the fair_deal and the new_frontier need him . 
he be not a rear-looking conservative , yet partisans of_that persuasion will miss him as much_as any . 
two of the vital qualities demand of a politician by other politicians be that he always keep a confidence and that he keep his word . 
sam_rayburn take unnumbered secrets with him to the grave , for he be never loquacious , and his word , once give , be not subject_to retraction . 
it might be add that as he keep his word so he expect that others keep theirs . 
the demonstration of his power be never flamboyant or theatrical . 
his leadership be not for audiences . 
a growl , a nod , be usually enough . 
when it be not , one of the great dramas of washington would be present . 
he would rise in the well of the house , his chin upon his chest , his hands grip the side of a desk , and the political and legislative chatter would subside into silence . 
he speak briefly , sensibly , to_the_point and without oratorical flourishes he make_sense good , plain american common_sense and the house usually recognize it and act upon it . 
these public efforts be rare because mr._rayburn normally do his counseling , persuading and educating long before an issue reach its test on the house floor . 
he expect democrats to do their duty when it had been patiently point_out to them . 
with his long service he have a long memory , an excellent thing in a political_leader . 
he be , of_course , in the house for a_very_long_time . 
there be only two men remain in congress who , with rayburn , vote for the declaration of war against germany in 1917 . 
to almost two generations of americans it must have seem as though the existence of mr._sam coincide with_that of the house . 
and it be the house he love . 
to be presiding_officer of_it be the end of his desire and ambition . 
the senate to him be not the `` upper body '' and he correct those who say he serve `` under '' the president . 
he serve `` with '' him . 
sound the roll of those with whom he serve and who precede him in death . 
woodrow_wilson , with whom he begin his years in washington , warren_g._harding , calvin_coolidge , fdr , with whom he manage a social revolution . 
and those still with us , herbert_c._hoover , harry_s._truman , dwight_d._eisenhower and john_f._kennedy . 
he be a fighter for those of his own party . 
mr._truman have only to recall the `` hopeless '' campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he be and the first experience of mr._kennedy with congress would have be sadder than it be had not mr._sam be there . 
as it was , his absence because of his final illness be a blow to the administration . 
with republican presidents , he fight fair . 
he be his own man , not an automatic obstructionist . 
he keep his attacks on republicanism for partisan campaigns , but that be part of the game he be_born to play . 
under any name - mr._speaker , mr._democrat , mr._sam - he be a good man . 
thirteen italian airmen who go_to the congo to serve the cause of peace under the united_nations banner have instead meet violent_death at the hands of congolese troops supposedly their friends . 
in 18 months , no_more grisly incident has been report from_that jungle . 
simply out of bloodlust , their murderers dismember the bodies and toss the remains into the river . 
the excuse was offer for them that they had mistake the italians for belgian mercenaries . 
in_other_words , atrocities by savages wear the uniform of the central government might be condone , had the victims been serve the cause of dissident katanga . 
does this suggest that the congo be fit for nationhood or that un is make any progress whatever toward its goal of so make_it ? 
to_the_contrary , through the past six weeks violence has been pile upon violence . 
mass rapes , troop mutinies , uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures , give no sanction by any political authority , have become almost daily occurrences . 
yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy be not the work of katanga . 
it happen in the territory of the leopoldville government , which be itself a fiction , demonstrably incapable_of governing , and command only such limited credit abroad as un support give it . 
the main question raise by the incident be how much longer will un bury its head in the sand on the congo problem instead of face the bitter fact that it have no solution in present terms ? 
the probable answer be that it will do so just_as long as russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young african_nations wake_up to the truth that out of false pride they are visit ruin on central_africa . 
right_now , they are push a resolution which would have un use its forces to invade and subjugate katanga . 
that notion be fantastically wrong-headed from several points_of_view . 
the un army be too weak , too demoralized for the task . 
further , it have its work cut_out stop anarchy where it is now garrison . 
last , it make_sense no sense to deliver katanga , the one reasonably solid territory , into the existing chaos . 
the congo should have been mandate , because it be not_ready for independence . 
the idea was not even suggest because political expediency prevail over wisdom . 
it be perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it be inconsistent with what is term political realism . 
but if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the general_assembly , it be time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach . 
otherwise , un will march blindly on to certain defeat . 
a recent editorial discuss a labor-management agreement reach between the southern_pacific_co. and the order of railroad telegraphers has been criticize on the grounds that it was not base on complete information . 
the editorial was base on a news association dispatch which say that the telegraphers had secure an agreement whereby they were guarantee 40 hours ' pay per week whether they work or not and that a reduction in their number was limit to 2 per_cent per_year . 
our comment be that this be `` featherbedding '' in its ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplace since it had enter into such an agreement . 
the statement was also make that undoubtedly the railroad had receive some compensating benefit from the telegraphers , but that it be difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life . 
additional information supply to us disclose that the railroad gain a stabilized supply of telegraphers of_which it be in need . 
also , normal personal attrition would make the job reduction provision more_or_less academic . 
the situation with regard_to the southern_pacific be therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries . 
the solution reach in the agreement be more acceptable to the railroad than that originally include in_a_series of union demands . 
time be when the house of delegates of the american_bar association lean to the common_sense side . 
but the internationalists have take_over the governing body of the bar , and when the lads meet in st._louis , it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the united_nations be scarcely less_than wonderful , despite an imperfection here_and_there . 
it be , the brief writers decide , `` man 's best hope for a peaceful and law abiding world '' . 
peace , it be wonderful , and `` world law '' , it be wonderful , too , and should n't we get an international covenant extend it into space , before the russians put some claim jumper on the moon ? 
meanwhile , in moscow , khrushchev was add his bit to the march of world law by promise to build a bomb with a wallop equal_to 100 million tons of tnt , to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can n't see the justice of surrender west_berlin to communism . 
a nuclear pacifier of these dimensions - roughly some six and a half_times bigger than anything the united_states has trigger experimentally - would certainly produce a bigger bang , and , just for kicks , khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from st._louis to the moon , where there would n't even be any beer to drink . 
while he be at it , the philosopher of the kremlin contribute an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellow at those in the west who can n't appreciate coexistence thru suicide . 
`` fools '' , he bay , `` what do you think you are do '' ? 
the only response we can think_of be the humble one that at_least we are n't play the marimba with our shoes in the united_nations , but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort . 
another evidence of the spreading rule of reason was provide from mexico_city with the daily hijacking of an american_plane by a demented algerian with a gun . 
the craft make the familiar unwelcome flight to havana , where , for some unknown reason , castro rush to the airport to express mortification to the colombian foreign_minister , a passenger , who be not an admirer of old ten o ' clock_shadow . 
the plane was send back to the united_states , for a change , but castro keep the crazy gunman , who will prove a suitable recruit to the revolution . 
less respect for the legal conventions was display by castro 's right_hand man , che_guevara , who edify the inter-american economic_and_social_council meeting in montevideo by read two secret american documents purloin from the united_states embassy at caracas , venezuela . 
the contents be highly embarrassing to american spokesmen , who be on_hand to promise latin_americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium . 
perhaps the moralities of world law are not advance by steal american diplomatic papers and planes , but the kennedy administration can always file a demurrer to the effect that , but for its own incompetence in protect american interests , these things would not happen . 
the same can be say about the half-hearted cuban invasion mount by the administration last april , which , we trust , be not symptomatic_of the methods to be invoke in hold_off the felonious khrushchev . 
pass the iron rations , please , and light another candle , for it 's get dark down here and we be minded to read a_bit of world law just to pass the time away . 
the board of suspension of the interstate_commerce commission has order a group of railroads not to reduce their freight_rates on grain , as they had plan to do this month . 
the request for lower rates originate with the southern railway , which has spend a good_deal of time and money develop a 100 - ton hopper car with which it say it can move grain at about half what it cost in the conventional , smaller car . 
by reduce rates as much_as 60 per_cent , it and its associated railroads hope to win_back some of the business they have lose to truckers and barge lines . 
the board 's action show what free_enterprise be up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws . 
word of dag_hammarskjold 's death in an african plane crash has send a shockwave around the globe . 
as head of the united_nations he be the symbol of world peace , and his tragic end come at a moment when peace hangs precariously . 
it be on the eve of a momentous u._n. session to come_to_grips with cold_war issues . 
his firm hand will be desperately miss . 
mr._hammarskjold be in africa on a mission of peace . 
he had seek talks with moise_tshombe , the secessionist president of congo 's katanga province where recent fighting had be bloody . 
he earnestly urge a cease-fire . 
the story of the fatal crash is not fully know . 
the u._n. - chartered plane which was fly from the conference city of ndola in northern_rhodesia had been riddle with machinegun bullets last weekend and was newly repair . 
whether this , or overt action , be the cause of the crash must be promptly determine . 
the death of mr._hammarskjold remove the united_nations ' most controversial leader . 
he be controversial because he be uncompromising for peace and freedom with justice . 
he courageously defend the rights of small nations , and he stood his ground against the savage attacks of the communist bloc . 
the congo , in whose cause he die , be the scene of one of his greatest triumphs . 
his policies had resolve the conflicts that threaten to ignite the cold_war and workable solutions were begin to take_shape . 
when the recent katangan outbreaks imperil these solutions mr._hammarskjold , despite the danger , fly to exert a calming influence . 
he give his life for his beliefs . 
the u._n. session schedule for today will meet under the cloud of his passing . 
it be a crucial session with the world on the edge of momentous developments . 
if the manner of his passing move the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolve with_reason and justice . 
that be the hope of mankind . 
reach agreement on projects of value to the whole community has long be one of greater_miami 's hardest tasks . 
too many have bog_down in bickering . 
even when public bodies arrive at a consensus , at_least one dissenting vote has be usual . 
so we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity . 
all nine members of the inter-american_center_authority vote for goodbody + company 's proposal to finance the long-awaited trade and cultural center . 
the widely known financial firm have 60 days to spell_out the terms of its contract . 
if the indenture is accept , the authority will proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue . 
then goodbody will hand_over a minimum of $ 15.5 million for develop the spacious graves_tract to house the center . 
the next step await approval today by the metro commissioners as the members of the dade_county_port_authority . 
they allot $ 500000 three years ago to support interama until its own financing could be arrange . 
less_than half the sum has been spend , since the interama board penny-pinch during that period of painstaking negotiations . 
the balance is being budget for the coming year . 
unanimity on interama be not surprising . 
it be one of the rare public ventures here on_which nearly everyone be agreed . 
the city of miami recently yield a prior claim of $ 8.5 million on the graves_tract to clear the way for the project . 
county officials have cooperate consistently . 
so have the people 's elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels . 
interama , as it rise , will be a living monument to greater_miami 's ability to get together on worthwhile enterprises . 
progress , or lack of_it , toward civil_rights in the 50 states is report in an impressive 689 - page compilation issue last week by the united_states commission on civil_rights . 
much happen in_this field during the past 12 months . 
each state advisory committee document its own activity . 
some accounts be quite lengthy but florida 's be the shortest of all , require only four paragraphs . 
`` the established pattern of relative calm in the field of race relations has continue in_all areas '' , report this group head by harold_colee of jacksonville and include two south_floridians , william_d._singer and john_b._turner of miami . 
`` no complaints or charges have been file during the past year , either verbally or written , from any individual or group . 
`` the committee continue to feel that florida has progress in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from_time_to_time in the entire spectrum of civil_rights '' . 
problems have arise in_this sensitive field but have been handle in most cases with_understanding and restraint . 
the progress report by the advisory committee be real . 
while some think we move too fast and_others too slowly , florida 's record be a good one and stand_out among the 50 . 
west_germany will face the crucial tests that lie ahead , on berlin and unification , with a coalition government . 
this be the key fact emerge from sunday 's national election . 
chancellor_adenauer 's christian democratic_party slip only a_little in the voting but it be enough to lose the absolute bundestag majority it has enjoy since 1957 . 
in_order_to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival parties which gain strength . 
inevitably this mean some compromise . 
the aging chancellor in_all likelihood will be retire . 
both willy_brandt 's social democrats , who gain 22 seats in the new parliament , and the free democrats , who pick_up 23 , will insist on_that before they enter the government . 
moon-faced ludwig_erhart , the economic_expert , probably will ascend to the leadership long deny him . 
if he become chancellor , dr._erhart would make few changes . 
the wizard who fashion west_germany 's astonishing industrial rebirth be the soul of free_enterprise . 
he be dedicated_to build the nation 's strength and , as be all west germans , to a free berlin and to reunion with captive east_germany . 
what be in doubt as the free germans and their allies consider the voting trends be the nature of the coalition that will result . 
if the party of adenauer and erhart , with 45 per_cent of the vote , approach the party of willy_brandt , which win 36 per_cent , the result would be a stiffening of the old resolve . 
west_berlin 's mayor_brandt vigorously demand a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his city and win votes by it . 
the free democrats ( 12 per_cent of the vote ) believe a nuclear war can be avoid by negotiate with the soviet_union , and more dealings with the communist bloc . 
the question leave by the election be whether west_germany veer slightly toward more firmness or more flexibility . 
it could go either way , since the gains for both points_of_view be about the same . 
regardless_of the decision two facts be clear . 
west_germany , with its industrial and military might , reaffirm its democracy and remain_firm with the free nations . 
and the career of konrad_adenauer , who uphold germany 's tradition of rock-like leaders which bismarck begin , draw_near the end . 
americans be a nation of joiners , a quality which our friends find endearing and sometimes amusing . 
but it can be dangerous if the joiner does n't want to make a spectacle of himself . 
for_instance , so-called `` conservative '' organizations , some of them secret , are sprout in the garden of joining where `` liberal '' organizations once take_root . 
one specific example be a secret `` fraternity '' which will `` coordinate anti-communist efforts '' . 
the principle be commendable but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going_to get gull . 
according to the chicago_tribune_news_service , state_atty._gen._stanley_mosk of california has devise a series of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization seek his money and his name : 
does it assail schools and churches with blanket accusations ? 
does it attack other traditional american institutions with unsupportable and wild charges ? 
does it put the label of un-american or subversive on everyone with whom it disagree politically ? 
does it attempt to rewrite modern history by blame american statesmen for wars , communism , depression , and other troubles of the world ? 
does it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone_calls and letter writing campaigns ? 
do its spokesmen seem more interested in the amount_of_money they collect than in the principles they purport to advocate ? 
in some instances a seventh question can be add : 
does the organization show an affinity for a foreign government , political_party or personality in_opposition or preference to the american system ? 
if the would-be joiner ask these questions he be not likely to be dupe by extremists who are seek to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic apprehensions of americans in a troubled time . 
fall somewhere in a category between einstein 's theory and sand_fleas - difficult to see but undeniably there , nevertheless - be the tropical green `` city '' of islandia , a string of offshore islands that have almost_no residents , limited access and an unlimited future . 
the latter be what concerns us all . 
whatever land you can see here , from the north tip end of elliott_key look southward , belong to someone - people who have title to the land . 
and what you can n't see , the land underneath the water , belong to someone , too . 
the public . 
the only real problem be to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water land can develop their property without the public lose its underwater land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment . 
in the fairly brief but hectic history of florida , the developers of waterfront land have too often wind_up with both their land and ours . 
in_this instance , happily , insistence is being make that our share is protect . 
and until this protection be at_least as concrete as , say , the row of hotels that bar us from our own sands at miami_beach , those who represent us all should agree to nothing . 
the reaction of certain city_council members to california 's newest anti-secrecy laws be as dismaying as it be disappointing . 
we had assume that at_least this local legislative body have nothing to hide , and , therefore , have no objections to make the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available to the public . 
in the preamble to the open-meeting statutes , collectively known as the brown_act , the legislature declare that `` the public commissions , boards and councils and other public agencies in_this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people 's business . 
it be the intent of the law that their actions be take openly and that their deliberations be conduct openly . 
`` the people of_this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them . 
the people , in delegate authority , do not give their public_servants the right to decide what be good for the people to know and what be not good for them to know . 
the full implementation of these noble words , however , has take the efforts of five sessions of the legislature . 
since 1953 california has lead the nation in enact guarantees that public business shall be publicly conduct , but not until this year did the lawmakers in sacramento plug the remaining loopholes in the brown_act . 
despite the lip_service pay by local_governments , the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subvert by reservations and rationalizations . 
when all else fail , it is argue that open sessions slow_down governmental operations . 
we submit that this be a most_desirable effect of the law - and one of its principal aims . 
without public scrutiny the deliberations of public agencies would no_doubt be conduct more speedily . 
but the citizens would , of_course , never be sure that the decisions that result be as correct as they be expeditious . 
if the dominican_republic achieve free , democratic government , it will be_due in large part to the u._s. show of force that enable president_balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of trujillo dictatorship . 
outwardly , ciudad_trujillo be calm . 
none of the trujillo family remain . 
mr._balaguer be in control , and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring . 
had u._s. warships not appear off the dominican coast , there is every possibility that the country would now be wrack by civil_war . 
ultimately either the trujillos would have been return to power or the conflict would have produce conditions favorable to a takeover by dominican elements responsive to castro in cuba . 
within the organization_of_american_states , there may be some criticism of_this unilateral american intervention which be not without risk obviously . 
but there be no complaint from the dominican crowds which line ciudad_trujillo 's waterfront shout , `` vive yankees '' ! 
more , the u._s. action was hail by a principal opposition leader , dr._juan_bosch , as having save `` many lives and many troubles in the near future '' . 
mr._balaguer 's troubles be by_no_means over . 
he will need the help of all oas members to eradicate , finally , the forces of authoritarianism , pro-trujillo and pro-castro alike . 
in cooperate toward that objective , oas might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrate by the united_states . 
those watch the growing rivalry between craft_unions and industrial_unions may recognize all the pressures that lead to the big labor split in 1935 . 
now , as then , it be a matter of jobs . 
craft_unions seek work that industrial_unions claim , such_as factory maintenance . 
the issue be sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession from the american_federation of labor of its industrial_union members . 
that breach was heal 20 years later by merger of the american_federation of labor and the congress of industrial_organizations . 
or that be what it look_like at_the_time . 
but automation and the increasing complexity of factories has renew the competition for jobs . 
walter_reuther , leader of the industrial_union faction of the afl - cio , say another two years of_this squabbling will be disastrous for all american labor . 
whether it could be as disastrous for american labor as , say , jimmy_hoffa of the teamsters , be a matter of conjecture . 
but the jurisdictional disputes that result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win friends for labor . 
engage as_it_is in a battle for world trade as a condition of national survival , this country can have little patience with labor 's family feuds . 
the concept of labor as a special class be outmoded , and in the task confront america as bastion of the free_world , labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself to survive . 
the army , navy and air_force , among others , may question secretary_freeman 's claim that the high estate of united_states agriculture be the `` strongest deterrent '' to the spread of communism . 
but the secretary insist that the success of the american farmer be the `` greatest single source of strength '' in the struggle to insure freedom around the world . 
mr._freeman say that in many_of the countries he visit on a recent world trade trip people were more awed by america 's capacity to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production - or even by the soviet 's successes in space . 
this should n't surprise the secretary ; american taxpayers have been impress by the surpluses for a long , long_time . 
in_fact , over the years , the american farmer 's capacity to overproduce has cost the taxpayers a large dollar . 
and thus_far , mr._freeman has offer very little relief . 
the 1961 feed_grain program , which the secretary sponsor , has been declare a_billion dollar fiasco . 
in exchange for higher price_supports , growers pledge reduction in planted acreage . 
but the farmers outsmart washington by shorten the distance between the rows and pour on the fertilizer . 
the result : $ 1.1 billion add to the deficit in the federal budget . 
perhaps , as mr._freeman say , american agriculture may stop the communists , but it is also swindle the american taxpayer . 
a senate subcommittee head by sen._jackson of washington has been go_over the state_department and has reach some predictable conclusions . 
the department need a clearer `` sense_of_direction '' at the top and it need fewer , but better , people , sen._jackson say . 
the subcommittee be not alone in question the effectiveness of the department . 
president_kennedy has indicate his dissatisfaction with its performance . 
but those who would revitalize so complex an organization must , first_of_all , overcome the resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures , suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes . 
nor does sen._jackson discuss the delicate situation create by the presence in the white_house of a corps of presidential assistants engage in the study of foreign_policy . 
this tend to create friction and confusion and has not make it easier for secretary_rusk to restore vigor and initiative among his subordinates . 
but competent observers believe he is make progress , particularly toward what sen._jackson list as the primary need - `` a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them '' . 
the jackson report will provide some of the political support mr._rusk will need if he is to get_rid_of department personnel engage , as sen._jackson put it , `` in work that does not really need do '' . 
mr._rusk should also draw comfort from sen._jackson 's recommendation that congressional methods of deal with national security problems be improve . 
self-criticism be a rare but needed commodity in congress . 
forecasting economic activity be a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist . 
but now apparently the job of secretary of labor require that he be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment trends . 
james_p._mitchell , when he be the head of the department , promise to eat his hat if unemployment did n't drop below three million a_couple_of years ago . 
he lose , but settle for a cake in the shape of a fedora . 
his successor , secretary_goldberg , also has been guess wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which has been hold just under 7 per_cent for the last 11 months . 
no betting man , mr._goldberg say he 's merely `` put my neck out again '' by predict the rate will go_down this month . 
he is base his guess on new government statistics that show business has broaden its stride - a new record high in personal_income , an increase in housing starts , a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for durable_goods . 
mr._mitchell have an excuse for lose - the steel strike last much longer than he anticipate . 
mr._goldberg have less reason for miss . 
the economy seem to be sail along on an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes be at an end so they can n't be blame in november . 
the odds thus appear favorable that the secretary 's neck may be spare . 
cambodia 's chief_of_state , who has been accuse of harbor communist marauders and otherwise make life miserable for neighboring south viet_nam and thailand , insist he would be very unhappy if communism establish its power in southeast_asia . 
but so convinced of communism 's inevitable triumph be prince_sihanouk that he be ready to throw_in_the_towel . 
`` i have to see the facts '' , be the way the prince put it . 
and from_that point of vantage he concede another two years_of_grace to nations maintain a pro-western posture . 
prince_sihanouk 's powers of prognostication some_day may be confirm but history be not likely to praise the courage of his convictions . 
commerce_secretary_hodges seem to have been cast in the role of pacemaker for official washington 's economic forecasters . 
weeks ago he see a business upturn in the second quarter of_this year while his colleagues in the cabinet were shake their heads in_disagreement . 
recently treasury_secretary_dillon and labor_secretary_goldberg fall into line with mr._hodges ' appraisal , though there has be some reluctance to do so at the white_house . 
and now mr._hodges has pioneer further into the economic unknown with the announcement that he think business has stop slide and that it should start go upward from this point . 
he be the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump . 
the secretary base his assessment on the upturn in retail sales . 
february 's volume be 1 per_cent above january 's for the first pickup since last october , although it be still 1.5 per_cent off from february 1960 . 
corroborate mr._hodges ' figures was the federal_reserve_board 's report of the large sales increase in the nation 's department_stores for the week end march 4 . 
in newark , for_example , this gain was put at 26 per_cent above the year-earlier level . 
of_course , some of the credit for the sale boost must be give to improvement in the weather and to the fact that easter come more_than two_weeks earlier than in 1960 . 
another optimistic sign , this one from the labor_department , be the report that the long rise in unemployment_compensation payments `` was interrupt for_the_first_time in the week end feb. 25 '' . 
initial claims for jobless benefits were say to have drop by 8100 in the week end march 4 . 
mr._hodges be so hopeful over the outlook that he does n't think there will be any need of a cut in income_taxes . 
well , we can n't have everything . 
prosperity for the whole nation be certainly preferred to a tax cut . 
new_jersey folk need not be tell of the builder 's march to the sea , for in a single generation he has parcel and populate miles of our shoreline and press_on to develop the few open spaces that remain . 
now the stone_harbor bird_sanctuary , 31 acres of magic attraction for exotic herons , be threatened , but the battlefront extend far beyond our state . 
against the dramatic fight being wage for preservation of 30 miles of cape_cod shoreline , the tiny tract at stone_harbor may seem unimportant . 
but interior_secretary_udall warn that there is a race on between those who would develop our few surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment of all as public preserves . 
the move for establishment of a national seashore park on 30000 acres of cape_cod , from provincetown to chatham , is strengthen by president_kennedy 's interest in_that area . 
but preservation of the natural beauty of the cape be of more_than regional concern , for the automobile age has make it the recreation spot of people from all_over the country . 
by comparison , stone_harbor bird_sanctuary 's allies seem less formidable , for aside from the audubon_society , they be mostly the snowy , common and cattle_egrets and the louisiana , green , little blue and black-crowned herons who nest and feed there . 
but there is hope , for conservation_commissioner_bontempo has tag the sanctuary as the kind_of place the state hope to include in its program to double its park space . 
the desirability of preserve such places as the cape dunes and stone_harbor sanctuary become more apparent every_year . 
public sentiment for conserve our rich natural heritage is grow . 
but that heritage is shrink even faster . 
much of the glamor president_kennedy 's peace_corps may have hold for some prospective applicants has been remove by sargent_shriver , the head corpsman . 
anybody who is expect a joyride should , according to mr._shriver , get_off the train right_now . 
first_of_all , the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling . 
it will be a 16 - hour training day . 
then off to a remote place in an underdeveloped country where the diet , culture , language and living conditions will be different . 
and the pay , of_course , will be nil . 
despite all this , the idea apparently has capture the imagination of countless youths whose parents be probably more surprised by the response than anybody else . 
the study of the st._louis area 's economic prospects prepare for the construction_industry joint_conference confirm and reinforce both the findings of the metropolitan st._louis survey of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the missouri-illinois countryside . 
st._louis sit in_the_center of a relatively slow-growing and in some places stagnant mid-continent region . 
slackened regional demand for st._louis goods and services reflect the region 's relative lack of purchasing power . 
not all st._louis industries , of_course , have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood . 
but for those which do , the slow growth of the area have a retarding effect on the metropolitan core . 
the city have a stake in stimulate growth and purchasing power throughout outstate missouri and southern_illinois . 
gov._dalton 's new commerce and industry commission is move to create a nine-state regional group in a collective effort to attract new industry . 
that be one approach . 
another would be to take the advice of dr._elmer_ellis , president of the university of missouri , and provide_for an impartial professional analysis of missouri 's economy . 
he say the state , in_order_to proceed with economic development , must develop an understanding of how the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the national economy . 
the research_center of the university 's school of business and public_administration be prepared to undertake the analysis dr._ellis has been talk_about . 
he and dean_john_w._schwada of the business_school outline the project at a recent conference . 
the university can make a valuable contribution to the state 's economic development through such a study . 
in southern_illinois , the new federal program of help to economically depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth . 
the carbondale_industrial_development_corp. has obtain a $ 500000 loan to help defray the cost of remodel a city-owned factory to accommodate production that will provide 500 new jobs . 
carbondale be in the herrin-murphysboro-west_frankfort labor_market , where unemployment has be substantially higher than the national average . 
the federal program eventually should have a favorable impact on missouri 's depressed areas , and in_the_long_run that will benefit st._louis as_well . 
politics-ridden st._clair county in illinois present another piece of the problem of metropolitan development . 
more industrial acreage lie vacant in st._clair county than in any other jurisdiction in the st._louis area . 
the unstable political situation there represent one reason new plants shy_away_from the east_side . 
and_then there is st._louis county , where the democratic leadership has show little appreciation of the need for sound zoning , of the important relationship between proper land use and economic growth . 
st._louis county under its present leadership also has largely close its eyes to the need for governmental reform , and permit parochial interests to take priority over area-wide interests . 
some plant-location specialists take these signs to mean st._louis county does n't want industry , and so they avoid the area , and more jobs are lose . 
metropolitan st._louis 's relatively slow rate_of_growth ought to be a priority concern of the political , business , civic and other leaders on both sides of the mississippi . 
without a great acceleration in the metropolitan area 's economy , there will not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters , and st._louis will slip into second-class status . 
many_of our very best friends be reformers . 
still we must confess that sometimes some of them go too far . 
take , for_example , the reformers among new_york_city 's democrats . 
having whip mr._de_sapio in the primaries and thus come_into control of tammany_hall , they have change the name to chatham_hall . 
even_though headquarters actually have been move_into the chatham building , do they believe that they can make the new name stick ? 
granted that the tammany name and the tammany tiger often were regard_as badges of political shame , the sachems of the hall also have a_few good marks to their credit . 
but it be tradition rather_than the record which balk at the expunging of the tammany name . 
after_all , it go_back to the days in_which sedition be not un-american , the days in_which the sons of st._tammany conspire to overthrow the government by force and violence - the_british government that_is . 
further , do our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo ? 
they will - when they give_up the donkey and the elephant . 
instead of attempt the impossible , why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger 's stripes be not black ? 
that might go_over . 
the white_house itself has take steps to remove a former batista official , col._mariano_faget , from his preposterous position as interrogator of cuban refugees for the immigration_service . 
the faget appointment be preposterous on several grounds . 
the kennedy_administration had assure anti-castro cubans that it would have nothing to do with associates of dictator_batista . 
use a batista man to screen refugees represent a total misunderstanding of the democratic forces which alone can effectively oppose castro . 
moreover , col._faget 's information on cuba be too outdated to be useful in `` screening '' castro agents ; the colonel flee to the friendly haven of the dominican dictatorship as soon as castro seize power . 
and while he had head batista 's anti-communist section , the batista regime did not disturb the communists so_much as more open opponents who were allege to be communists . 
responsibility for the faget appointment rest with gen._j._m. swing , an eisenhower appointee as head of the immigration_service . 
gen._swing has receive public attention before_this for abuse of some of the prerogatives of his office . 
his official term expire last summer . 
some reports say he was rescue from timely retirement by his friend , congressman_walter of pennsylvania , at a moment when the kennedy_administration was diligently search for all the house votes it could get . 
congressman_walter has be all-powerful in immigration matters , but he has announce plans to retire in 1962 . 
at that point the administration will have little reason to hang_on to gen._swing . 
the faget case be the kind_of salvage job the administration should not have to repeat . 
as president , dwight_d._eisenhower often assume a role aloof from the strife of partisan politics . 
as a former president , however , mr._eisenhower abandon this role to engage in partisan sniping during a new_york republican rally , and generally miss his target . 
mr._eisenhower seize upon the incident of the postcard lose by a peace_corps girl in nigeria to attack the entire corps as a `` juvenile experiment '' and to suggest send a corps member to the moon . 
this be juvenile ridicule . 
nowhere did the speaker recognize the serious purpose of the corps or its welcome reception abroad . 
his words be the more ungracious to come from a man who lend his name to the eisenhower_exchange fellowships dedicated_to the same goal of international understanding . 
the former president blithely ignore recent history in speak of `` dollarette '' dollars under kennedy_administration fiscal policies . 
it be the eisenhower_administration which produce the largest peacetime deficit . 
finally , mr._eisenhower find nothing but confusion in washington . 
this statement recall the 1959 berlin crisis , when president_eisenhower first tell reporters that berlin could not be defend with conventional weapons and_then add that a nuclear defense be out of the picture too . 
the crisis has been renew since then but the confusion has hardly been compound . 
ex-presidents , relieve of accountability for policy , sometimes seem to feel free_of accountability for their words . 
some of former president_truman 's off-the-cuff discourses have be in_that vein . 
nobody can deny the right of former chief_executives to take_part in politics , but the american people expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership and to treat issues with a sense_of_responsibility . 
this be a matter of respect for the presidency . 
mr._eisenhower 's new_york speech does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship . 
the queen_mary has long be a symbol of speed , luxury , and impeccable british service on the high seas . 
reports that the venerable liner , which has be in_service since 1936 , be to be retire strike a nostalgic note in many_of us . 
but the cunard line , influence by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment , has decide to keep the queen_mary in_service until next spring at_least . 
a new queen , with the prosaic title of q3 , had been plan for several years to replace the queen_mary . 
the_british government , concern about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding_industry , had put_through a bill to give cunard loans and grants total $ 50400000 toward the $ 84000000 cost of a new 75000 - ton passenger liner . 
since 1957 , more_and_more trans-atlantic passengers have been cross by air . 
economy class fares and charter flights have attract almost all new passengers to the airlines . 
competition from other steamship_lines has cut cunard 's share of sea passengers from one-third to one-fourth and this year the line show a marked drop of profits on the atlantic run . 
the cunard line have under_consideration replace the queen_mary with a ship smaller than 75000 tons . 
this would be cheaper to operate and could be use for cruises during the lean winter months . 
also under_consideration be an increased investment in cunard_eagle airways which has apply to serve new_york . 
the decline of the cunard line from its position of dominance in atlantic travel be a significant development in the history of transportation . 
gen._maxwell_taylor 's statement in saigon that he be `` very_much encouraged '' about the chances of the pro-western government of viet_nam turn_back communist guerrilla attacks come_close to an announcement that he will not recommend dispatch united_states troops to bolster the vietnamese army . 
gen._taylor will report to president_kennedy in a_few days on the results of his visit to south viet_nam and , judge from some of his remarks to reporters in the far_east , he be likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of vietnamese military , economic , political and other resources . 
there was good reason for gen._taylor to make an inspection trip at this time . 
communist guerrillas recently have been report increase their activities and the great flood of the mekong_river has interpose a new crisis . 
south viet_nam 's rice surplus for next year - more_than 300000 tons - may have been destroy . 
the viet_cong , the communist rebels , may have lose their stored grain and arms factories . 
the rebels may try to seize what be left of the october harvest when the floods recede and the monsoon end in november . 
nothing that be likely to happen , however , should prompt the sending of united_states soldiers for other_than instructional missions . 
the indochina struggle be a war to stay out of in 1954 , when gen._ridgway estimate it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions at the outset to win a war the_french were lose . 
it be a war to stay out of today , especially in_view of the fact that president_ngo_dinh_diem apparently does not want united_states troops . 
he may want additional technical help , and this should be forthcoming . 
south viet_nam has receive $ 1450000000 in united_states aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance has been step_up since vice_president lyndon_b._johnson 's visit last may . 
gen._taylor , the president 's special military adviser , be a level-headed officer who be not likely to succumb to propaganda or pressure . 
it be probable that his recommendations will be informed and workable , and that they will not lead to involve the united_states in an asian morass . 
gov._john_m._dalton , himself a lawyer and a man of long service in government , speak with rich background and experience when he say in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sit in the missouri general_assembly , or quit accept fees from individuals and corporations who have controversies with or axes_to_grind with the government and who are retain , not because of their legal talents , but because of their government influence . 
ambassador_stevenson yesterday describe the u. n . 's problem of elect a temporary successor to the late dag_hammarskjold as `` the gravest crisis the institution has face '' . 
of_course it be . 
if the decision go_wrong , it may be - as mr._stevenson fear - `` the first_step on the slippery path downhill '' to a u._n. without operational responsibilities and without effective meaning . 
the integrity of the office not merely require that the secretary_general shall be , as the charter put it , `` the chief administrative officer of the organization '' , but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority `` external to the organization '' . 
in_other_words , the secretary_general is to be a nonpartisan , international servant , not a political , national one . 
he should be , as dag_hammarskjold certainly be , a citizen of the world . 
the charter does stipulate that `` due regard '' shall be pay to the importance of recruit the staff on `` as wide a geographical basis as possible '' . 
the united_states and its allies have have no objection to this . 
what they have object to be the attempt of the russians to make use of the tragedy of dag_hammarskjold 's death to turn_into the entire u._n. staff from the secretary down into political agents of the respective countries from which they come . 
the controversy now revolve_around mainly around the number and geographic origin of the deputies of the secretary_general and , more particularly , around the nature of his relationship with them . 
although the united_states and the u._s._s._r. have been argue whether there shall be four , five or six top assistants , the_most important element in the situation be not the number of deputies but the manner in_which these deputies are to do their work . 
if any one of them have any power to veto the secretary_general 's decisions the nature of the organization will have change . 
if they give him advice when he ask it , or if they perform specified duties under his direction , the nature of the u._n. will not of_necessity change . 
the secretary_general must have , subject_to the constitutional direction of the security_council and the general_assembly , the power to act , to propose action and to organize action without being hobble by advisers and assistants act_on someone else 's instructions . 
this be the root issue for which the united_states should stand . 
we should not become confused or let our public become confused over irrelevant questions of number or even of geography . 
what we must have , if the united_nations is to survive , be as nonpolitical , nonpartisan an organization at the top as human_beings can make it , subject_to no single nation 's direction and subservient to no single nation 's ambition . 
the new city_charter , which should get a yes vote as question no. 1 on nov. 7 , would not make a good mayor out of a bad one . 
there be no such magic in man-made laws . 
but it would greatly strengthen any mayor 's executive powers , remove the excuse in large degree that he be a captive of inaction in the board of estimate , increase his budget-making authority both as to expense and capital budgets , and vest in him the right to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy . 
lawmaking power is remove from the board of estimate and make a partnership responsibility of the city_council and the mayor . 
thus there be a clearer division of authority , administrative and legislative . 
the board is diminish in both respects , while it retain control over zoning , franchises , pier leases , sale , leasing and assignment of property , and other trusteeship functions . 
the board will be able to increase , decrease , add or eliminate budget_items , subject_to the mayor 's veto ; but the city_council will now share fully this budget-altering power . 
overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes will require concurrence by board and council , and a two-thirds vote . 
the controller retain his essential `` fiscal watchdog '' functions ; his broad but little use investigative powers are confirm . 
he lose now-misplaced tax_collection duties , which go to the finance_department . 
on net balance , in_spite_of controller_gerosa 's opposition to the new charter as an invasion of his office , the controller will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government than he have now . 
borough presidents , while retain membership in the board of estimate , lose their housekeeping functions . 
highways go to a new department of highways , sewers to the department of public_works , such street cleaning as borough presidents now do ( in queens and richmond ) to the sanitation_department . 
some fiscal changes be important . 
the expense ( operating ) budget is to be a program budget , and red_tape is cut to allow greater autonomy ( with the mayor approve ) in fund transfers within a department . 
the capital budget , for construction of permanent improvements , become an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises ; but , as a second-look safeguard , each new project must undergo a board of estimate public hearing before construction proceed . 
a road block to desirable local or borough improvements , heretofore dependent_on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on progress , is remove by make these a charge against the whole city instead of an assessment pay by those immediately affect . 
this will have a beneficial effect by expedite public business ; it will also correct some injustices . 
enlargement of the city_council and a new method of select members will be discuss tomorrow . 
the inter-american_press_association , which blanket the western_hemisphere from northern canada to cape_horn , is meet in new_york_city this week for_the_first_time in eleven years . 
the i._a._p._a. be a reflection of the problems and hopes of the hemisphere ; and in these days this inevitably mean a concentration on the effects of the cuban revolution . 
as the press in cuba was gradually throttle by the castro regime , more_and_more cuban publishers , editors and correspondents were force into exile . 
the i._a._p._a. find itself drive from journalism into politics as it do its best to bring_about the downfall of the castro_government and the return of the cuban press to the freedom it know before batista 's dictatorship begin in 1952 . 
freedom_of_the_press was lose in cuba because of decades of corruption and social imbalances . 
in such conditions all freedoms are lose . 
this , in more diplomatic language , be what adlai_stevenson tell the newspaper men of latin_america yesterday on behalf of the united_states_government . 
he feel able to end on a note of hope . 
he see evidence of fair winds for the ten-year alliance for progress plan with its emphasis on social reforms . 
no group can contribute more to the success of the program than the editors and publishers of the inter-american_press_association . 
the twenty-second soviet communist_party congress open in moscow today in a situation contrast sharply with the script prepare many months ago when this meeting was first announce . 
according to the original program , premier_khrushchev expect the millions look toward the kremlin this morning to be filled with_admiration or rage - depend_upon individual or national politics - because of the `` bold program for build communism in our time '' which the congress will adopt . 
but far from be concerned about whether or not russia will have achieve utopia by 1980 , the world is watch moscow today primarily for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear armageddon in the immediate future . 
the evident contradiction between the rosy picture of russia 's progress paint_a_picture by the communist_party 's program and the enormous dangers for all humanity pose by premier_khrushchev 's berlin policy has already lead to speculation abroad that the program may be severely alter . 
whether it is or not , the propaganda impact on the free_world of the document scheduled to be adopt at this meeting will be far less_than had been originally anticipate . 
and there must be many soviet citizens who know what is go_on and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promise for 1980 they and their children must first survive . 
this congress will see premier_khrushchev consolidate his power and lay the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness remove him from the scene in the next few years . 
the widespread purge that has take_place the past twelve months or_so among communist leaders in the provinces give assurance that the party officials who will dominate the congress , and the central_committee it will elect , will all have pass the tightest possible khrushchev screening , both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on_the_job . 
dr._james_b._conant has earn a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer . 
his earlier reports consider the american public_schools basically sound and not in need of drastic change . 
now , a close look at the schools in and around the ten largest cities , include new_york , has shatter this optimism . 
dr._conant has come_away shocked and angry . 
his new book , entitled `` slums and suburbs '' , call_for fast and drastic action to avert disaster . 
there be room for disagreement concern some of dr._conant 's specific views . 
his strong opposition to the transfer of negro children to schools outside their own neighborhood , in the interest of integration , will be attack by negro leaders who have fight for , and achieve , this open or permissive enrollment . 
dr._conant may underestimate the psychological importance of even token equality . 
his suggestion that the prestige colleges be make the training institutions for medical , law and graduate_schools will run_into strong opposition from these colleges themselves - even_though what he is recommend is already take_shape as a trend . 
but these be side issues to a powerful central theme . 
that theme cut through hypocrisies , complacency and double-talk . 
it label the slums , especially the negro slums , as dead-end_streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters . 
the villains of the piece be those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters , and dr._conant accuse employers and labor_unions alike . 
the facts , he add , are hide from public view by squeamish objections to call bad_conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration rather_than on real improvement of the schools , regardless_of the color of their students . 
a call for action `` before it be too late '' have alarming implications when it come from a man who , in his previous reports on the schools , caution so strongly against extreme measures . 
these warnings must_not be treat lightly . 
dr._conant 's conscientious , selfless efforts deserve the nation 's gratitude . 
he has serve in positions of greater glamour , both at_home and abroad ; but he may well be do his greatest service with his straightforward report on the state of the public_schools . 
a fascinating letter has just reach this desk from a correspondent who like to receive so-called junk mail . 
he be delighted to learn that the post_office_department is now going_to expand this service to deliver mail from representatives in congress to their constituents without the use of stamps , names , addresses or even zone numbers . 
in_accordance_with legislation pass at the last session of congress , each representative is authorize to deliver to the post_office in bulk newsletters , speeches and other literature to be drop in every letter_box in his district . 
this mean an added burden to innumerable postmen , who already are complain of heavy loads and low pay , and it presumably mean an increased postal deficit , but , our correspondent write , think_of the additional junk mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on_a_regular_basis . 
letter writing be a dying art . 
occasional letters are send by individuals to one another and many are write by companies to one another , but these be mostly typewritten . 
most mail these days consist_of nothing that could truly be called a letter . 
old , tired , trembling the woman come to the cannery . 
she had , she say , hear that the plant was close . 
it could n't close , she say . 
she had raise a calf , grow it beef-fat . 
she had , with her own work-weary hands , put seeds in the ground , watch them sprout , bud , blossom , and get ready to bear . 
she be ready to kill the beef , dress it out , and with vegetables from her garden was going_to can soup , broth , hash , and stew against the winter . 
she had do it last year , and the year before , and the year before that , and she , and her people be dependent upon these cans for food . 
this did not happen in counties of north_georgia , where the rivers run and make rich the bottom land . 
nor in south_georgia , where the summer sun shine warmly and give early life to the things grow in the flat fields . 
this happen in decatur , dekalb_county , not 10 miles from_the_heart of metropolitian atlanta . 
and now , the woman , tired and trembling , come here to the dekalb_county cannery . 
`` be it so the cannery is going_to close '' ? 
o._n._moss , 61 , tall , grey as a possum , canning plant chief since 1946 , did n't know what to say . 
he did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this summer . 
he did say he be out of cans , the no .3 's , but `` i requisition 22000 '' . 
he say he have no .2 's enough to last two_weeks more . 
threat of close the cannery be a recent one . 
a three-man committee has recommend to commission_chairman_charles_o._emmerich that the dekalb_county cannery be close . 
reason : the cannery lose $ 3000 yearly . 
but dekalb citizens , those who use the facilities of the cannery , say the cannery be not supposed to make any money . 
`` the cannery '' , say mrs._lewellyn_lundeen , an active booster of the cannery since its opening during the war and rationing years of 1941 , to handle the `` victory_garden '' produce , `` be a service to the taxpayer . 
and one of the best services available to the people who try to raise and can meat , to plant , grow vegetables and put_up them up . 
it help those people who help themselves . 
`` the county , though , seem more interested in those people who do n't even try , those who sit and draw welfare checks and line_up for surplus food '' . 
a driver of a dairy truck , who begin work at 1 a. m. finish before breakfast , then go_out and grow a garden , and who has use the cannery to save and feed a family of five , ask , `` what in the world will we do '' ? 
`` what in the world '' , echo others , those come with the beans , potatoes , the tomatoes , `` will any of us do '' ? 
moss , a man who know how much the cannery help the county , does n't believe it will close . 
but he be in_the_middle , an employe of dekalb , but on_the_side of the people . 
the young married people ; the old couples . 
the dairy truck_driver ; the old_woman with the stew . 
`` do n't ask me if i think the cannery help '' , he say . 
`` sir , i know the cannery help '' . 
most_of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness come hard . 
when a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately cause us pain or hardship it be not always easy to say , `` just forget it '' . 
there is one thing i know ; a person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace as long as the heart hold a grudge . 
i know a man who hold resentment against a neighbor for more_than three decades . 
several years ago i be his pastor . 
one night , at the close of the evening service , he come_forward , leave his resentment at the altar and give his heart to god . 
after almost everyone had go he tell me the simple story of how one of his neighbors had move a fence a_few feet over on his land . 
`` we try to settle this dispute '' , he say , `` but could never come_to an agreement . 
i settle it tonight '' , he continue . 
`` i leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has been lift off my heart , i have leave my grudge at the altar and forgive my neighbor '' . 
forgiveness be the door through which a person must pass to enter the kingdom_of_god . 
you cannot wear the banner of god and at_the_same_time harbor envy , jealousy and grudges in your heart . 
henry_van_dyke say , `` forgive and forget if you can ; but forgive anyway '' . 
jesus make three things clear about forgiveness . 
we must , first_of_all , be willing to forgive others before we can secure god 's forgiveness . 
`` for if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly father will also forgive you : but if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your father forgive your trespasses '' . 
matthew 6 : 14 - 15 . 
it will do no good to seek god 's forgiveness until we have forgive those who have do us wrong . 
then , jesus indicate that god 's forgiveness be unlimited . 
in the prayer jesus teach his disciples to pray we find these words , `` forgive us our debts '' . 
when a person meet god 's requirements for the experience of forgiveness he be forgiven . 
god 's mercy and patience will last forever . 
forgiveness imply more_than a person want his past sins cover by god 's love . 
it also imply that a man want his future to be free from the mistakes of the past . 
we want the past forgive , but at_the_same_time we must be willing for god to direct the future . 
finally , we must be willing to forgive others as_many times as they sin against us . 
once peter ask , `` how oft shall my brother sin against me , and i forgive him ? 
till seven times ? 
jesus saith unto him , until seventy times seven '' . 
matthew 18 : 21 - 22 . 
jesus not_only teach forgiveness , he give us an example of_it on the cross . 
with all the energy of his broken body he pray , `` father , forgive them , for they know not what they do '' . 
luke 23 : 34 . 
she 's be in and out of my house for a dozen years now , although she be still a teen-ager who look_like a baby , she is get_married . 
her mother , now dead , be my good friend and when she come to tell us about her plans and to show_off her ring i have a sobering wish to say something meaningful to her , something her mother would wish say . 
for_a_while there be such shrill girlish commotion i could n't have make myself heard if i 'd have the equivalent of the message to garcia . 
but when some of the squeals had subside and she had be through one of those sessions that be so indispensable to the young female - six girls sprawl on one bed , drink cokes and giggle - she come_back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute . 
`` how do you know you love somebody enough to get_married '' ? she ask . 
it be the oldest and toughest question young lovers have ever ask : how can you be sure ? 
`` be n't you sure '' ? 
i ask , look at her searchingly . 
i want to grab her by the arm and beg her to wait , to consider , to know for_certain because life be so_long and marriage be so important . 
but if she were just have a normal case of pre-nuptial jitters such a question might frighten her out of a really good marriage . 
besides , in_all honesty , i do n't know how you can be sure . 
i do n't know any secret recipe for certainty . 
in the fevered , intoxicating , breathless state of be in_love the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships are sometimes obscure . 
i know of but one test and i throw_out it out to her for what it be worth . 
`` does he ever bore you '' ? 
i ask . 
`` bore me '' ? she be shocked . 
oh , no-o ! 
why , he be so darling and & & & `` . 
`` i mean '' , i go_on ruthlessly , `` when he 's not talk_about you or himself or the wonders of love , be he interesting ? 
does he care about things that matter_to you ? 
can you visualize be stranded with him on a desert island for years and years and still find him fascinating ? 
because , honey , i think silently , there be plenty of desert islands in every marriage - long periods when you be hopelessly stranded , together . 
and if you bore each other then , heaven help you . 
she come_back the other day to reassure me . 
she has study and observe and she be convinced that her young_man is going_to be endlessly enchanting . 
she ask if i have other advice and , heady with_success , i rush it in , i hope not too late . 
be friends with your mother-in-law . 
jokes , cartoons and cynics to_the_contrary , mothers-in-law make good friends . 
i do not know dr._wilson_sneed well . 
but i be deeply moved by his letter of resignation as rector of st._luke 's church in atlanta . 
it be the cry of not just one heart ; it speak_for many in the clergy , i suspect . 
the pulpit be a lonely place . 
who stop to think_of that ? 
imagine the searching and the prayer that lie behind the letter the rector write after almost a decade of service to this majestic church . 
`` such a church need vigor and vitality in its rector and one man have only so_much of these endowments '' , he tell his members . 
a minister should not stay `` beyond the time that his leadership should benefit '' his church , he write , `` for he become ordinary '' . 
and so the young minister resign , to go and study and pray , having never pass a day , he tell his parishioners , when `` i did not gain from you far more_than i ever give to you '' . 
his very honest act call_up the recent talk i have with another minister , a modest methodist , who say : `` i feel so deeply blessed by god when i can give a message of love and comfort to other men , and i would have it no other way : and it be unworthy to think_of self . 
but oh , how i do sometimes need just a moment of rest , and peace , in myself '' . 
a man who give himself to god and to the believers of his church take upon himself a life of giving . 
he does not expect to get great riches or he would not have choose to answer the call to preach . 
the good ones be not motivated to seek vainly , nor be they disposed to covet comfort , or they would have been lead to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity . 
theirs be a sacrificial life by earthly standards . 
yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation of the infinite through him - we who readily accept his sacrifice as our due , we of the congregations be the first to tell him what be in our minds instead of listen to what be in his soul . 
we press him to conform_to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions with his word , and god 's . 
we do not defeat the good ones with this cruelty , but we add to their burden , while expect them to bestow saintliness upon us in_return for ostentatious church attendance and a_few bucks a week , american cash . 
if we break the minister to our bit , we are buy back our own sins . 
if he won n't break , we add to the stress he bear . 
and a minister of all men be most conscious that he be mere man - prone to the stresses that earthly humanity be heir to . 
we expect him to be noble , and to make us so - yet he know , and try to tell us , how very humble man must be . 
we expect bestowal of god 's love through him . 
but how little love we give him . 
the church truly be not a rest_home for saints , but a hospital for sinners . 
yet every sunday we sinners go_to that emergency_room to receive first_aid , and we leave unmindful that the man who minister to us be a human_being who suffer , too . 
mr._podger always particularly enjoy the last night of each summer at loon_lake . 
the narrow fringe of sadness that run around it only emphasize the pleasure . 
the evening was not always spend in the same way . 
this year , on a night cool with the front of september move_in , but with plenty of summer still about , the podgers were hold a neighborhood gathering in the pod . 
the little cottage was burst with people of all ages . 
in_the_midst of_it all , mr._podger come_out on the pod porch , alone . 
he had that day attend a country auction , and he had come_back with a prize . 
the prize be an old-fashioned , woven cloth hammock , complete with cross-top pillow , fringed side pieces , and hooks for hanging . 
mrs._podger had obligingly push things around on the porch to make room for it , and there it be , sling in a vine-shaded corner , the night breeze ripple its fringe with a slow , caressing movement . 
mr._podger sit_down in it , push himself back_and_forth in one or two slow , rhythmic motions , and_then swing his feet up into it . 
he close his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly over him . 
suddenly one young voice rise above the others . 
`` but '' , it say , `` do you always know when you be happy '' ? 
the voice sink back into the general tangle of sound , but the question stay in mr._podger 's mind . 
here , in the cool , autumn-touched evening , mr._podger mentally retrace a day that had leave him greatly contented and at_peace . 
it had begin with the_blue jay feather . 
walk along the lake before breakfast , mr._podger had see the feather , and the_bird that had lose it in flight . 
the winging spread of blue had go_on , call harshly , into the wood . 
the small shaft of blue had drift down and come to rest at his feet . 
all_day_long mr._podger , who be a straw-hat man in the summer , had wear the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield . 
would a blue feather in a man 's hat make him happy all day ? 
hardly . 
but it be something to have see it float down through the early morning sunshine , link the_blue of the sky with the_blue of the asters by the lake . 
then , since the auction was being hold nearby , he had walk to_it . 
and there , on_the_way , had be the box_turtle , that slow , self-contained , world-ignoring relic of pre-history , bent , for reasons best know to itself , on cross the road . 
it was do very_well , too , having reach the center , and was pursue its way with commendable singleness of purpose when mr._podger see hazard approach in the shape of a flashy little sports_car . 
would the driver see the turtle ? 
would he take_pains to avoid it ? 
mr._podger take_a_chance . 
take_off his hat and signal the driver with_it , mr._podger step into the road , lift the surprised turtle and consummate its road-crossing with what must have be a breath-taking suddenness . 
the turtle immediately withdraw into its private council room to study the phenomenon . 
but mr._podger and the driver of the sports_car wave at each other . 
here in the cool darkness mr._podger could still feel the warmth of midday , could still see the yellow butterflies dance over the road , could still see the friendly grin on the young , sun-browned face as the driver look_back over his shoulder for a moment before the car streak out_of_sight . 
where be the driver now ? 
what was he do ? 
and the turtle ? 
mr._podger smile . 
for a_few brief minutes they had all be part of one little drama . 
the three would never meet again , but for_some_reason or other mr._podger be sure he would always remember the incident . 
then there had be the auction itself . 
mr._podger hear again , at_will , the voice of the auctioneer , the voices of the bidders , and finally the small boy who had be so interested in mr._podger 's hammock purchase . 
`` i like them things , too '' , he had say . 
`` we got one at_home . 
you know what ? 
if you 're lie ' out in the hammock at night , and it get kinda cool - you_know - you just take these sides with the fringe on - see - and wrap ' em right over you . 
i do it , lots o ' times - i like to lie in a hammock at night , by myself , when it be all quiet . 
the wind move it a_little bit - you know '' . 
mr._podger had thank him gravely , and now he make use of the advice . 
as he pull the fringed sides up and make himself into a cocoon , mr._podger see that thin , attractive , freckled little face again , and hope that the boy , too , was lie in a cool , fringed-wrapped quiet . 
alacrity , the podger cat , come by the hammock , rub her back briefly against it , and_then , sure of a welcome , hop up . 
she remark that she find the night wind a_little chilly , and mr._podger take her inside the fringe . 
soon her purring rival the chirping of the tree_crickets , rival the hum of voices from inside the pod . 
mr._podger was just add this to his pictures of the day when the screen_door open and pam burst_out . 
`` dad '' ! she say . 
`` it 's get so chilly we 've light a fire , and we 're going_to tell a round_robin story - a nice , scary one . 
we need you to start it . 
why be you out here all by yourself ? 
be n't you happy '' ? 
mr._podger open his cocoon and emerge , tuck alacrity under his arm to bring her in by the fire . 
`` of_course i be '' , he say . 
`` never happier in my life . 
i just come out here to know it '' . 
as the south begin another school_year , national and even world attention is direct at the region 's slow progress toward racial equality in the public_schools . 
desegregation is begin in two more important southern cities - dallas and atlanta . 
in each city civic and education leaders have been work hard to get public_opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment . 
these programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully . 
the programs do not take sides on the issue itself . 
they point_out simply that `` it be the law of the land '' . 
the two cities have the examples of little_rock and new_orleans to hold_up as warnings against resort to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation . 
even better , they have the examples of nashville and houston to hold_up as peaceful and progressive programs . 
in each case there be an initial act of violence . 
in nashville , a school was dynamite . 
in houston , there be a_few incidents of friction between whites and negroes , none of_which be serious . 
in each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government halt the threats of more serious incidents . 
the nashville plan , incidentally , has become recognized as perhaps the_most acceptable and thus the_most practical to put into effect in the troubled south . 
it be a `` stair-step '' plan , in_which desegregation begin in the first_grade . 
each_year another grade is add to the process , until finally all 12 grades be integrated . 
the schedules be flexible so_that the program can be accelerate as the public become more tolerant or realize that it be something that have to be do , `` so why not now '' . 
the program has work well in both nashville and houston . 
it meet a serious rebuff in new_orleans , where the two schools select for the first moves toward integration were boycott by white parents . 
another attempt will be make this year in new_orleans to resume the program . 
generally , throughout the south , there be a growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation is meet . 
perhaps the_most eloquent move toward removal of racial barriers has be in dallas . 
during the summer , negroes begin quietly patronize previously segregated restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments . 
it be part of a citywide move toward full integration . 
so successful has be this program , work_out by white and negro civic_leaders , that further extensions are expect in the next few months . 
hotels , for_example , be ready to let_down the bars . 
already , at_least one hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis . 
several conventions have been hold in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis . 
this be a radical change in attitude from the conditions which prevail several years ago , when a series of bombings was direct against negroes who were move_into previously all-white neighborhoods of dallas . 
it be also symptomatic_of a change in attitude which appear to be spread all across the south . 
southern whites themselves are realize that they had be wrong in use violence to try to stop negroes from claim equal rights . 
they insist they be ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occur in alabama when the freedom riders seek to break_down racial discrimination in local bus_depots . 
all across the south there be signs that racial violence is find less approval among whites who themselves would never take_part active part but might once have show a tolerant attitude toward it . 
there be many causes for this change . 
one of the_most important be economic . 
business_leaders be aware now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence . 
they are put strong pressure on their police_departments to keep order . 
in_the_past these same southerners were incline to look_the_other_way . 
and as the businessmen have begin to act , a real sense of co-operation has spring_up . 
this co-operation has embolden other southern whites to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation . 
they realize that by act in_concert , rather_than individually , they will not be pick_out as objects of retaliation - economic and otherwise . 
since move from a chicago suburb to southern_california a_few months ago , i 've been introduce to a new game called lanesmanship . 
play mostly on the freeways around los_angeles , it go like this : 
a driver cruise easily at 70 m. p. h. in lane a of a four-lane freeway spy an incipient traffic_jam ahead . 
traffic in the next lane appear to be move more smoothly so he poke a tentative fender into lane_b , which be heavily populated by cars also move at 70 m. p. h. . 
the adjacent driver in lane_b have three choices open_to him . 
he can ( 1 ) point his car resolutely at the invading fender and force the other driver back into lane a ; ( 2 ) slow_down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes ; or ( 3 ) alternately accelerate and decelerate , thus keep the first driver guess as to his intentions , thereby make a fascinating sport of the whole affair . 
the really remarkable thing to me be that most california natives unhesitatingly elect to slow_down and permit the invading car free access . 
whether or not this is do out of enlightened self-preservation , i do n't know . 
but it is do , consistently and i be both surprised and impressed . 
this could never happen in my native chicago . 
there such soggy acquiesence would be look_upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood . 
in chicago , the driver cut_out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor in an effort to force the other car back . 
fail this , he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly . 
this negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways , however , do an injustice to southern_california drivers . 
at the risk of lose my charge-a-plate at marshall_field and company , i would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype . 
after three months of research , i can state unequivocally that los_angeles drivers be considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers i 've ever encounter . 
during one recent day of driving about los_angeles there be actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers stop an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull_out of an impossible side street . 
an out-of-town writer come_up_to paul_richards today and ask the oriole manager if he think his ball_club would be improved this year . 
now richards , of_course , is know as a deep thinker as baseball managers go . 
he can often make the complex ridiculously simple , and vice_versa . 
this happen to be vice_versa , but even_so , the answer be a masterpiece . 
`` it 's a whole lot easier '' , he say , `` to increase the population of nevada , than it is to increase the population of new_york_city '' . 
and with_that he walk off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher . 
`` that be undoubtedly a hell of a quote '' , say the writer , scratch his head . 
`` now , if i can just figure_out what he 's talk_about , i 'll use it '' . 
this be just richard 's way of say that last year the_birds open spring_training with a_lot_of jobs wide_open . 
some brilliant rookies nail_down them down , so_that this spring just two spots , left and right field , be really up for grabs . 
it should be easier to plug two spots than it be to fill the wholesale lots that be open last year , but so_far it has n't work that way . 
this angle of just where the orioles can look_for improvement this year be an interesting one . 
you 'd never guess it from the way they 've play so_far this spring , but there remain a feeling among some around here that the orioles still have a chance to battle for the pennant in 1961 . 
obviously , if this club is going_to move from second to first in the american_league , it will have to show improvement someplace . 
where can that improvement possibly come from ? 
you certainly can n't expect the infield to do any better than it do last year . 
brooks_robinson be great , and it be conceivable that he 'll do even better in 1961 than he do in 1960 . 
you can n't expect it , though . 
robby 's performance last year be tremendous . 
it 's the same with ron_hansen and jim gentile . 
if they do as_well as they do in 1960 there can be no complaint . 
they should n't be ask to carry any_more of the burden . 
hansen will be get a late spring_training start , which might very_well set_back him back . 
he got_off to an exceptional start last season , and under_the_circumstances probably won n't duplicate it . 
there are some clubs which claim they learn something about pitch to him last year . 
they do n't expect to stop him , just slow_down him down some with the bat . 
he 'll still be a top player , they concede , because he 's get a great glove and the long ball going_for him . 
but they expect to reduce his over-all offensive production . 
gentile can hardly do better than drive_in 98 runs . 
do n't ask him more . 
i have a hunch marv_breeding might move_up a notch . 
but even_so , he have a good year in 1960 and won n't do too_much better . 
so , all_in_all , the infield can n't be expect to supply the added improvement to propel the_birds from second to first . 
and the pitching will also have trouble do better . 
richards get a great performance out of his combination of youth and experience last season . 
where , then , can we look_for improvement ? 
`` from triandos , brandt and walker '' , answer richards . 
`` they be the ones we can expect to do better '' . 
the man be right , and at this time , indications be that these three be ready for better seasons . 
triandos has n't prove it yet , but he say he be convinced his thumb be all_right . 
he jam it this spring and has have to rest it , but he say the old injury has n't bother him . 
if he can bounce_back with one of those 25 home_runs years , the club will have to be better off offensively . 
i be still not convinced , though , i 'll have to see more of him before predict that big year for him . 
hank_foiles , back_up by frank_house who will be within calling distance in the minors , make_up better second line catching than the_birds have all last year , but gus be still that big man you need when you start talk pennant . 
to me , brandt look as though he could be in_for a fine year . 
he has n't play too_much , because richards has been work_on him furiously in batting practice . 
he 's hit the ball hard , in the batting_cage , and his whole attitude be improved over this time last year . 
when he come to baltimore , he was leave a team which be supposed to win the national_league pennant , and he was join what seem to be a second division american_league club . 
he be down , hard to talk to , and far too nonchalant on the field . 
as of now , that all seem behind him . 
he 's be entirely different all spring . 
and walker look stronger , seem to be throw better than he did last year . 
let him bounce_back , and he could really set_up the staff . 
so , if the orioles are to improve , brandt , triandos and walker will have to do it . 
so_far the platoons on left and right_fielders do n't seem capable_of carry the load . 
of_course , this is n't take into consideration the population of nevada and new_york_city , but it be the way things look from here at this point . 
be the mother of an `` autistic '' child at_fault ? 
( the `` autistic '' child be one who seem to lack a well-defined sense of self . 
he tend to treat himself and other people as if they be objects - and sometimes he treat objects as if they be people . ) 
did his mother make him this way ? 
some people believe she did . 
we think differently . 
we believe that autism , like so many other conditions of defect and deviation , be to a large extent inborn . 
a mother can help a child adapt to his difficulties . 
sometimes she can - to a large extent - help him overcome them . 
but we do n't think she create them . 
we do n't think she can make her child defective , emotionally disturbed or autistic . 
the mother of a difficult child can do a great_deal to help her own child and often , by share her experiences , she can help other mothers with the same problem . 
since little is know about autism , and almost nothing has been write for the layman , we 'd like to share one experienced mother 's comments . 
she write : 
`` as the mother of an autistic child who be lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything , i have to manipulate my son 's fingers for him when he first play with a new toy . 
he want me to do everything for him . 
`` you do n't believe that autistic children become autistic because of something that happen to them or because of the way their mother treat them . 
but i do and my psychiatrist does , too . 
i know , that my son want control and direction , but be autistic myself i cannot give full control or direction . 
`` one thing i notice which i have seldom hear mention . 
this be that autistic people do n't enjoy physical contact with others - for_instance , my children and i . 
when i hold my son he stiffen his whole body in my arms until he be as straight and stiff as a board . 
he push and straighten himself as if he can n't stand the feeling of being hold . 
physical contact be uncomforatble for him '' ! 
this mother be quite correct . 
as a rule , the autistic child does n't enjoy physical contact with others . 
parents have to find other ways of comfort him . 
for the young child this may be no_more_than provide food , light or movement . 
as he grow older it may be a matter of provide some accustomed object ( his `` magic '' thing ) . 
or certain words or rituals that child and adult go_through may do the trick . 
the answer be different for each autistic child , but for most there is an answer . 
only ingenuity will uncover it . 
`` dear doctors : we learn this year that our older son , daniel , be autistic . 
we did not accept the diagnosis at_once , but gradually we are coming_to . 
fortunately , there is a nursery_school which he has be able to attend , with a group of normal children . 
`` i try to treat daniel as if he be normal , though of_course i realize he be far from_that at_present . 
what i do be to try to bring him into contact with reality as_much_as_possible . 
i try to give him as_many normal experiences as possible . 
`` what be your experience with autistic children ? 
how do they turn_out later '' ? 
many autistic children grow_up to lead relatively normal lives . 
certainly , most continue to lack a certain warmth in communication with other people , but many adjust to school , even college , to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood . 
a first grader color pictures one solid color , everything - sky , grass , boy , wagon , etc. . 
when different colors are use , she be just_as likely to color trees purple , hair green , etc. . 
the other children in the class use this same coloring_book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color . 
should i show my daughter how things should be color ? 
she be an aggressive , nervous child . 
is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow these traits ? 
her choice of one color mean she is simply enjoy the motor act of coloring , without having reach the point of select suitable colors for different objects . 
this immature use of crayons may suggest that she be a_little immature for the first_grade . 
no , coloring be n't exactly something you teach a child . 
you sometimes give them a_little demonstration , a_little guidance , and suggestions about stay inside the lines . 
but most learn to color and paint as and when they be ready with only a very little demonstration . 
see in decorating circles of_late is a renewed interest in an old art : embroidery . 
possibly responsible_for this be the incoming trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms , which seem slate to replace the one-color look to which we have be accustomed . 
just_as a varitinted oriental rug may suggest the starting_point for a room scheme , so may some of the newest versions of embroidery . 
one such , in_fact , be a rug . 
though not actually crewel embroidery , it have that look with its over-stitched raised pattern in blue , pink , bronze and gold and a sauterne background . 
the twirled , stylized design of winding stems and floral forms strongly suggest the embroidered patterns use so extensively for upholstery during the jacobean period in england . 
traditional crewel embroidery which seem to be appear more_frequently this fall than in_the_past few years be still available in_this country . 
the work is execute in england ( by_hand ) and can be work in any desired design and color . 
among some recent imports be seat covers for one series of dining_room chairs on_which were depict salad_plates overflowing_with tomatoes and greens and another set on which a pineapple was work in naturalistic color . 
for a particularly fabulous room which house a collection of fine english_chippendale furniture , fabric wall panels were embroider with a typically chinese-inspired design of_this revered eighteenth_century period . 
since the work is do by_hand , the only limitation , it is say , `` be that of human conception '' . 
modern embroidered panels , framed and mean to be hang on the wall , be another aspect of_this trend . 
these have never go_out of style in scandinavian homes and now seem to be reappear here_and_there in shops which specialize in handicrafts . 
an amateur decorator might try_her_hand_at a pair during the long winter evenings , and , by pick_up her living_room color_scheme , add a decorative do-it-yourself note to the room . 
california_democrats this weekend will take_off the wraps off a 1962 model statewide campaign vehicle which they have been quietly assemble in a_thousand district headquarters , party clubrooms and workers ' backyards . 
they seem darned proud_of it . 
and they be confident that the gop , currently assail by dissensions within the ranks , will be impress by the purring power beneath the hood of_this grassroots-fueled machine . 
their meeting at san_francisco is nominally schedule as a conference of the california_democratic_council directorate . 
but it will include 200 - odd officeholders , organization leaders and `` interested party people '' . 
out of_this session may come : 
plans for a dramatic , broad-scale party rally in los_angeles next december that would enlist top-drawer democrats from all_over the country . 
blueprints for double the cdc 's present 55000 enrollment . 
arrangements for a statewide pre-primary endorsing convention in fresno next jan. 26 - 28 . 
and proposals for a whole series of lesser candidate-picking conventions in the state 's 38 new congressional_districts . 
at the head of the cdc be an unorthodox , 39 - year-old amateur politico , thomas_b._carvey_jr. , whose normal profession be help develop hughes_aircraft 's moon missiles . 
he 's approach his democratic duties in hard-nosed engineering fashion . 
view from afar , the cdc look_like a rather stalwart political pyramid : its elected directorate fan_out into an array of district leaders and standing_committees , and thence into its component clubs and affiliated groups - 500 or_so . 
much of its strength stem from the comfortable knowledge that every `` volunteer '' democratic organization of any consequence belong_to the cdc . 
moreover , the entire state democratic hierarchy , from gov._brown on down to the county chairmen , also participate in_this huge operation . 
contrarily , republican `` volunteers '' go their separate ways , and thus_far have give no indication that they 'd be willing to join_forces under a single directorate , except in the_most loose-knit fashion . 
carvey believe that reapportionment , which leave many democratic clubs split by these new district boundaries , actually will increase cdc membership . 
where only one club exist before , he say , two will flourish henceforth . 
biggest organizational problem , he add , be set_up cdc units in rock-ribbed democratic territory . 
paradoxically the council be weakest in areas that register 4 - and 5 - to-1 in the party 's favor , strongest where democrats and republicans compete on a fairly even basis . 
like most democratic spokesmen , carvey predict 1962 will be a tremendously `` partisan year '' . 
hence the attention they 're lavish on the cdc . 
in_all_probability , the council will screen and endorse candidates for the assembly and for congress , and_then strive to put its full weight behind these pre-primary favorites . 
this bode heated contests in several districts where claims have already been stake out by democratic hopefuls who do n't see eye-to-eye with the cdc . 
naturally , the statewide races will provide the major test for the expanding council . 
shunt aside by the rampant organizers for john_f._kennedy last year , who relegate it to a somewhat subordinate role in the presidential campaign , the cdc plainly intend to provide the party 's campaign muscle in 1962 . 
there is evidence that it will be happily receive by gov._brown and the other constitutional incumbents . 
carvey consider that former vice_president nixon would be brown 's most formidable foe , with ex-gov._knight a close second . 
but the rest of the gop gubernatorial aspirants do n't worry him very_much . 
in his cdc work , carvey have the close-in support and advice of one of california 's shrewdest political strategists : former democratic national_committeeman_paul_ziffren , who back him over a northland candidate espouse by atty._gen._stanley_mosk . 
( significantly , bitter echoes of the 1960 power struggle that see mosk move_into the national committee post over ziffren be still audible in party circles ) . 
note : we 've just receive an announcement of the 54 th assembly district post-reapportionment organizing convention wednesday night in south_pasadena 's war_memorial_bldg. , which graphically illustrate the cdc 's broad appeal . 
state_sen._dick_richards will keynote ; state and county committeemen , cdc directors and representatives , members of 16 area clubs , and `` all residents '' have been invite . 
this is going_to be a language_lesson , and you can master it in a_few minutes . 
it be a short course in communese . 
it work with english , russian , german , hungarian or almost any other foreign tongue . 
once you learn how to translate communese , much of each_day 's deluge of news will become clearer . 
at_least , i have find it so . 
for some compulsive reason which would have fascinate dr._freud , communists of all shapes and sizes almost invariably impute to others the very motives which they harbor themselves . 
they accuse their enemies of precisely the crimes of_which they themselves be most guilty . 
president_kennedy 's latest warning to the communist world that the united_states will build_up its military strength to meet any challenge in berlin or elsewhere was somewhat surprisingly , report in full text or fairly accurate excerpts behind the iron_curtain . 
then the communese reply come_back from many mouthpieces with striking consistency . 
now listen closely . 
moscow radio from the literary_gazette in english to england . 
`` president kennedy once_again interpret the soviet proposals , to sign a peace_treaty with germany as a threat , as part of the world menace allegedly loom over the countries of capitalism . 
evidently the war drum beating and hysteria so painstakingly being stir_up in the west have been plan long in_advance . 
the west_berlin crisis is being play_up artificially because it is need by the united_states to justify its arms drive '' . 
the soviet news_agency tass datelined from new_york in english to europe : 
`` president kennedy 's enlargement of the american military program was welcome on wall_street as a stimulus to the american munitions_industry . 
when the stock_exchange open this morning , many dealers be quick to purchase shares in douglas , lockheed and united_aircraft and prices rise substantially . 
over 4 million shares were sell , the highest figures since early june . 
( quotations follow '' . ) 
tass datelined los_angeles , in english to europe : 
`` former vice_president nixon come_out in support of president_kennedy 's program for step_up the arms_race . 
he also demand that kennedy take additional measures to increase international tension : specifically to crush the cuban revolution , resume nuclear testing , resist more vigorously admission of china to its lawful seat in the united_nations , and postpone non-military programs at_home '' . 
tass from moscow in english to europe : 
`` the american press clamor for many days promise president_kennedy would reply to the_most vital domestic and foreign problems confront the united_states . 
in_fact , the world hear nothing but sabre-rattling , the same exercises which prove futile for the predecessors of the current president . 
if there were no west_berlin problem , imperialist quarters would have invent an excuse for step_up the armaments race to try to solve the internal and external problems beset the united_states and its nato partners . 
washington apparently decide to use an old formula , by inject large military appropriations to speed the slow revival of the u._s. economy after a prolonged slump '' . 
and now , for communist listeners and readers : 
moscow_radio in russian to the ussr : 
`` the u._s._president has show once_again that the united_states need the fanning of the west_berlin crisis to justify the armaments race . 
as_was_to_be_expected kennedy 's latest speech was greet with_enthusiasm by revenge-seeking circles in bonn , where officials of the west german government praise it '' . 
moscow_novosti article in russian , datelined london : 
`` u._s. pressure on britain to foster war hysteria over the status of west_berlin has reach its apogee . 
british common_sense be proverbial . 
the present attempts of the politicians to contaminate ordinary britons show that this british common_sense be unwilling to pull somebody else 's chestnuts out of the fire by new military adventures '' . 
east_berlin ( communist ) radio in german to germany : 
`` a better position for negotiations be the real point of_this speech . 
kennedy know the west will not wage war for west_berlin , neither conventional nor nuclear , and negotiations will come as certainly as the peace_treaty . 
whenever some washington circles be really ready for talks to eliminate friction they have always succumb to pressure from the war clique in the pentagon and in bonn . 
in kennedy 's speech be cross currents , sensible ones and senseless ones , reflect the great struggle of opinions between the president 's advisers and the political and economic forces behind them . 
well , dear listeners , despite all the shouting , there will be no war over west_berlin '' . 
moscow_tass in russian datelined sochi : 
`` chairman khrushchev receive the u._s._president 's disarmament adviser , john_mccloy . 
their conversation and dinner pass in a warm and friendly atmosphere '' . 
now , to translate from the communese , this mean : 
the `` west_berlin '' crisis be really an east_berlin crisis . 
the crisis was artificially stir_up by the kremlin ( wall_street ) and the red_army ( pentagon ) egg_on by the west germans ( east_germans ) . 
the reason be to speed_up domestic production in the ussr , which khrushchev promise upon grab power , and try to end the permanent recession in russian living standards . 
chairman_khrushchev ( kennedy ) rattle his rockets ( sabre ) in_order_to cure his internal ills and to strengthen his negotiating position . 
his advisers in the politburo ( white_house ) are engage in a great struggle of opinions , so he be not always consistent . 
the soviet_union will fight neither a conventional nor a nuclear war over berlin , and neither will its warsaw_pact allies . 
the west have no intention of attack russia . 
chairman_khrushchev and john_mccloy have a terrible row at sochi . 
see , communese be easy - once you get_onto it . 
aug. 4 , 1821 , nearly a century after benjamin_franklin found the pennsylvania_gazette - a century during which it had undergo several changes in ownership and a_few brief suspensions in publication - this paper made its first_appearance as the saturday_evening_post . 
the country be now full_of gazettes and samuel_c._atkinson and charles_alexander , who had just take_over franklin 's old paper , desire a more distinctive name . 
when found by franklin the gazette be a weekly family newspaper and under its new name its format remain that of a newspaper but its columns gradually contain more_and_more fiction , poetry , and literary essays .

but during the second_half of the century its fortunes reach a low point and when in 1897 cyrus_h._k._curtis purchase it - `` paper , type , and all '' - for $ 1000 it be a 16 - page weekly filled with unsigned fiction and initialed miscellany , and with only some 2000 subscribers . 
little more_than a fine old name , valuable principally because of the franklin tradition , the saturday_evening_post be slow to revive . 
but curtis pour over $ 1 million into it and in_time it again become one of the_most popular weeklies of the country .

the 350 th anniversary of the king_james_bible is being celebrate simultaneously with the publishing today of the new_testament , the first part of the new_english_bible , undertake as a new translation of the scriptures into contemporary english . 
since it was issue in the spring of 1611 , the king_james_version has been most generally consider the_most poetic and beautiful of all translations of the bible . 
however , biblical scholars frequently attest to its numerous inaccuracies , as old manuscripts were uncover and scholarship advance . 
this result in revisions of the king_james_bible in 1881 - 85 as the_english revised_version and in 1901 as the american_standard_version . 
then in 1937 america 's international_council of religious education authorize a new revision , in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient manuscripts and languages . 
undertake by 32 american scholars , under the chairmanship of rev._dr._luther_a._weigle , former dean of yale_university divinity_school , their studies result in the publishing of the revised_standard_version , 1946 - 52 . 
the new_english_bible ( the old_testament and apocrypha will be publish at a future date ) has not been plan to rival or replace the king_james_version , but , as its cover states , it is offer `` simply as the bible to all those who will use it in reading , teaching , or worship '' . 
time , of_course will testify whether the new version will have achieve its purpose . 
bible reading , even more so than good classical_music , grow in_depth and meaning upon repetition . 
if this new bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout the years , it will not survive the ages as has the king_james_version . 
however , an initial perusal and comparison of some of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seem to speak well of the efforts of the_british biblical scholars . 
one be impressed with the dignity , clarity and beauty of_this new translation into contemporary english , and there be no_doubt that the meaning of the bible be more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary language than in the frequently archaic words and phrases of the king_james . 
for_example , in the third chapter of matthew , verses 13 - 16 , describe the baptism of jesus , the 1611 version read : 
`` then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john , to be baptize of him . 
`` but john forbid him , say , i have need to be baptize of thee , and comest thou to me ? 
`` and jesus answer say unto him , suffer it to be so now : for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness . 
then he suffer him . 
`` and jesus , when he was baptize go_up straightway out of the water : and lo , the heavens were open unto him , and he see the spirit of god descend like a dove , and light upon him '' . 
certainly , the meaning be clearer to one who be not familiar_with biblical teachings , in the new_english_bible which read : `` then jesus arrive_at jordan from galilee , and he come to john to be baptize by him . 
john try to dissuade him . 
' do you come to me ' ? 
he say ; ' i need rather to be baptize by you ' . 
jesus reply , ' let it be so for the present ; we do_well to conform this way with all that god require ' . 
john then allow him to come . 
after baptism jesus come_up out of the water at_once , and at that moment heaven open ; he see the spirit of god descend like a dove to alight upon him '' ; 
( the paragraphing , spelling and punctuation are reproduce as print in each version . ) 
among the_most frequently quote biblical sentences be the beatitudes and yet so few persons , other_than scholars , really understand the true meaning of these eight blessings utter by jesus at the beginning of the sermon_on_the_mount . 
to illustrate , the first blessing in the king_james_bible read : `` blessed be the poor in spirit ; for their 's be the kingdom of heaven '' . 
the new version state : 
`` how blest be those who know that they be poor ; the kingdom of heaven be theirs '' . 
some of the poetic cadence of the older version certainly be lost in the newer one , but almost anyone , with a fair knowledge of the_english language , can understand the meaning , without the necessity of interpretation by a biblical scholar . 
to a novice that be significant . 
in the second and third chapters of revelation the new version retain , however , the old phrase `` angel of the church '' which biblical scholars have previously interpret as mean bishop . 
this be not contemporary english . 
for_the_most_part , however , the new version be contemporary and , as_such , should be the means for many to attain a clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words record so many hundreds of years ago by the first followers of christ . 
originally record by_hand , these words have been copy and recopy , translate and retranslate through the ages . 
discoveries recently made of old biblical manuscripts in hebrew and greek and other ancient writings , some by the early church_fathers , in themselves call_for a restudy of the bible . 
to have the results record in everyday usable english should be of benefit to all who seek the truth . 
there be one danger , however . 
with contemporary english change with the rapidity that mark this jet age , some of the words and phrases of the new version may themselves soon become archaic . 
the only answer will be continuous study . 
the new_testament offer to the public today be the first result of the work of a joint committee make_up of representatives of the church_of_england , church of scotland , methodist_church , congregational_union , baptist_union , presbyterian_church of england , churches in wales , churches in ireland , society_of_friends , british and foreign_bible_society and national_society of scotland . 
prof._c._h._dodd , 76 , a congregational minister and a leading authority on the new_testament , be general director of the project and chairman of the new_testament panel . 
this be the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities and colleges schedule what they call `` homecoming day '' . 
they seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes . 
the football opponent on homecoming is , of_course , select with the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a christian when throw to one of the emperor 's lions . 
it be true , of_course , the uncertainties of life be what they be , that as now_and_then the christian kill the lion , homecoming days have been ruin by a visiting team . 
even with all possible precaution , homecomings be usually rather cruel and sad , and only the perpetually ebullient and the continually optimistic are make happy by them . 
more_often_than_not , as the old_grad wander along the old paths , his memory of happy days when he stroll one of the paths with a coed beside him become an ache and a pain . 
he can smell again the perfume she wear and recall the lilting sound of laughter , and can smell again the aroma of autumn - fallen leaves , the wine of cool air , and the nostalgia of woodsmoke which blow through all the winds of fall . 
it is at precisely such moments that he encounter a_couple_of undergraduates , faces alight , hold hands and talk happily as they come_along , oblivious_of him , or throw him the_most fleeting and casual of glances , such_as they would give a tethered goat . 
usually , they titter loudly after they have pass_by . 
his dream go . 
he feel , suddenly , the weight of the fat be on him . 
his bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous . 
his bifocals blur . 
his legs suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary , as if he had walk for miles , instead of stroll a_few hundred yards along the old campus paths . 
bitterness come_over him and the taste of time be like unripe persimmons in his mouth . 
it be not_much better if he meet with old classmates . 
too often , unless he hail them , they pass him by . 
he recall with a wry smile the wit who say , on return from a homecoming reunion , that he would never go again because all his class had change so_much they did n't even recognize him . 
if they do meet and recognize one another , slap backs and embrace , the moment soon be done . 
after_all , when one has ask whatever become of old joe and charlie ; when one has inquire who it be sue_brown marry and where it be they now live ; when questions are ask and answer about families and children ; and old professors ; when the game and its probable outcome has been exhaust ; that does_it . 
by then one begin to notice the middle-age spread ; the gray hairs , the eyeglasses , bodies that be too thin or too heavy ; the fading signs of old beauty ; the athlete of by-gone years who wear a size 46 suit and puff when he has finish a sentence of any length ; then , it is time to break_up it up and move_on . 
it be , if anything , worse on the old player . 
he sit in the stands and he does n't like that . 
enough of his life was spend there on the field for him never to like watch the game as a spectator in the crowd . 
he always feel lonely . 
a team feel something . 
on a team a man feel he be a part of_it and akin to the men next to him . 
in the stands he be lonely and lost , no_matter_how many be about him . 
he sit there remember the tense moment before the ball was snap ; the churning of straining feet , the rasp of the canvas pants ; the smell and feel of hot , wet woolen sleeves across his face . 
he remember the desperate , panting breath ; the long_runs on the kick-offs ; the hard , jolting tackles ; the breakthrough ; the desperate agony of goal-line stands . 
and so , he squirm with each play , remember his youth . 
but it be no use . 
it be gone . 
no_matter_how often a man go_back to the scenes of his youth and strength , they can never be recapture again . 
since the obvious be not always true , the republican_national_committee wisely analyze its defeat of last autumn and find that it occur , as suspect , in the larger cities . 
of 40 cities with populations of 300000 and more , mr._kennedy carry 26 and mr._nixon 14 . 
there are eight states in_which the largest urban vote can be the balance_of_power in any close election . 
these are new_york , pennsylvania , michigan , maryland , missouri , new_jersey , illinois and minnesota . 
in 1952 mr._eisenhower win all_but missouri . 
yet , in 1960 all eight give majorities to mr._kennedy . 
republican research break_down the vote in philadelphia . 
mr._nixon , despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups , fail to do so . 
his visit to warsaw , poland , after the russian journey in the summer of 1959 was expect to win the polish vote which , in several cities , be substantial . 
yet , the gop breakdown discover that in philadelphia_mr._nixon receive but 21 per_cent of the so-called `` polish '' vote ; 30 per_cent of the `` irish '' vote , and 18 per_cent of the `` negro '' vote . 
a gop `` task_force ' committee will seek to find_out how its party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities . 
the task_force might make a start in washington with republican congressional leaders . 
these gentlemen already have do the party harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas and by their criticism of mr._kennedy for talk_about a recession and unemployment . 
this error was compound by declare the recession to be `` a statistical one '' , and not a reality . 
the almost six million persons without jobs and the two million work part-time do not consider themselves and their plight as statistical . 
they did not view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by secretary of labor_goldberg as politics , which the gop declare it to be . 
the people visit be glad to have a government with heart enough to take an interest in their misery . 
senator_mundt 's gross distortion of president_eisenhower 's conversation into a denunciation of president_kennedy as too left_wing , a statement mr._eisenhower declare to be entirely false , be another case_in_point . 
if the republicans and southern democrats join to defeat medical_care for the old under the social_security program , they will thereby erect still another barrier to gop hopes in the cities . 
the present republican leadership as practice by mundt , goldwater , bridges , dirksen , et al , is repeat the errors of the party leadership of the 1930 s . 
in_that decade the partisan zeal to defend mr._hoover , and the party 's failure to anticipate or cope_with the depression , cause a great majority of americans to see the republican_party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human_beings caught_up in the distress and suffering bring_on by the economic crash . 
the republican_party be not lacking in humanity , but it permit its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear devoid_of any consideration for people in_trouble . 
farmers call their mule-drawn pickup_trucks `` hoover carts '' . 
smokers reduce to `` the makings '' , speak of the sack tobacco as `` hoover dust '' . 
one may be sure the present republican congressional leadership has n't mean to repeat this error . 
but it be in the process of so doing because it apparently give priority to try to downgrade john_f._kennedy . 
that this be not good politics is underscore by the latest poll figures which show that 72 per_cent of the people like the way in_which the new president is conduct the nation 's business . 
the_most articulate republicans be those who , in their desire to get_back at mr._kennedy , already have create the image of a republican leadership which be reluctant to assist the distressed and the unemployed , and which be even more unwilling to help old people who need medical_care . 
if they also defeat the school bill , the gop task_force won n't have much research to do . 
it will early know why the party won n't win_back city votes . 
the 1962 general_assembly has important business to consider . 
the tragedy be that it will not be able to transact that business in any responsible manner . 
after the griffin-byrd political troup has complete the circuit in november in the name of a pre-legislative_forum , this is going_to be the_most politically oriented legislature in history . 
every legislator from brasstown_bald to folkston is going_to have his every vote subject to the closest scrutiny as a test of his political allegiances , not his convictions . 
hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system stands less chance than ever . 
and just how far can the legislature go toward set_up a self-insurance system for the state in_the_midst of a governor 's race `` ? 
how unpartisan will be the recommendations of lt._gov._garland_byrd 's senate_committee on government_operations ? 
the situation already be bad because the legislature move the governor 's race forward a_few months , cause the campaigning to get_started earlier than usual . 
but when former gov._marvin_griffin and lt._gov._byrd accept the invitations of the georgia_state chamber_of_commerce to join the tour next november , the situation was aggravate . 
neither have a choice other_than to accept the invitation . 
to have refuse would have be political suicide . 
and it may be that one or both men actually welcome the opportunity , when the bravado comments are cast_aside . 
the georgia_state chamber_of_commerce try to guard against the danger of eliminate potential candidates . 
it want the state_democratic_executive_committee to pick the `` serious candidates '' . 
but state_party_chairman_james_gray of albany say no , and he did n't mince any words . 
`` they are just ask too_much '' , he say . 
we can n't think_of anyone else who would want to separate serious candidates from other candidates , either . 
there are other dangers : 
politics be an accelerating game . 
`` if an opponent accuse you of lying , do n't deny it . 
say he be a horse thief '' , run an old adage . 
these men be spenders . 
if either one ever start make promises , there is no telling where the promises would end . 
griffin 's rural_roads_authority and byrd 's 60000 miles of county contracts would look_like pauper 's oaths . 
the trouble be that at_first_glance the idea look_like such a good one . 
why not have them travel the state in november debate ? 
it would present a forum for them in almost every community . 
but further thought bring the shuddery visions of a governor 's race being run in the next legislature , the spectre of big spending programs , the ooze of mudslinging before the campaign should even begin . 
there be a way_out of_this . 
the chamber has not arrange a pre-legislative forum . 
it has arrange a campaign_for_governor . 
if it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications are close next spring , and_then carry all the candidates on a tour of debates , it can provide a service to the state . 
but the legislature should be grant the opportunity to complete its work before choose_up sides for the race . 
former british prime_minister attlee say eisenhower be not a `` great soldier '' . 
ike 's somewhat like george_washington . 
both win a pretty fair-sized war with a modest assist from british strategy . 
congressmen return from recess say the people admire president_kennedy so_much , they be even willing to heed his call to sacrifice - and give_up his program . 
slogan of the john_birch_society : `` paddle your own canoe . 
the guy who make the motor boats may be a communist '' . 
a republican survey say kennedy win the ' 60 election on the religious issue . 
too many people be afraid if the gop win , they 'd have to spend all their time pray . 
the providence_journal editorial ( jan. 25 ) entitled `` east_greenwich faces a housing_development problem '' point to a dilemma that face communities such_as ours . 
your suggested solution , it seem to me , be grossly oversimplified and be inconsistent with your generally realistic attitude toward , and endorsement of , sound planning . 
first_of_all there be ample area in east_greenwich already zoned in the classification similar to_that which petitioner request . 
this land be in various stages of development in several locations throughout the town . 
the demand for these lots can be meet for_some_time to come . 
this would seem to indicate that we are try neither `` to halt an influx of migrants '' nor are we `` set_up such standards for development that only the well-to-do could afford to buy land and build in the new sites '' . 
what we are attempt to do be achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low_density residential areas and industrial and commercial development . 
it be in_fact entirely consistent_with your suggestion of modest industrial development to help pay governmental costs . 
bostitch , inc. be approximately half_way through a 10 - year exemption of their real_estate tax . 
the wisdom of grant such tax exemptions be another matter , but this particular instance be , in my opinion , completely satisfactory . 
the 1960 tax book for east_greenwich indicate a valuation for this property in_excess of two million dollars . 
with our current $ 3 per hundred tax_rate , it be safe to assume that this will qualify when you suggest a community should `` try to develop a modest industrial plant '' as the best way to meet these problems . 
in_order_to attract additional industry that be compatible with this community it be all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance in the tax structure . 
as this tax_base grow so then can your medium and low_density residential areas grow . 
mr._richard_preston , executive_director of the new_hampshire state_planning and development_commission , in his remarks to the governors_conference on industrial_development at providence on october 8 , 1960 , warn against the fallacy of attempt to attract industry solely to reduce the tax_rate or to underwrite municipal services such_as schools when he say : `` if this be the fundamental reason for a community 's interest or if this be the basic approach , success if any will be difficult to obtain '' . 
he go_on to say : `` in_the_first_place , industry per_se be not dedicated_to the role of savior of foundering municipalities . 
it be not in business for_the_purpose_of absorb increased municipal costs no_matter_how high a purpose that may be '' . 
while councilman_olson cite the anticipated increase in school costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer , the impact upon a school_system does not have to be measure only in increased taxes to find alarm in uncontrolled growth . 
we in east_greenwich have the example of two neighboring communities , one currently utilize double sessions in their schools , and the other face this prospect next year . 
it has already been report in your newspapers that the east_greenwich_school_committee is consider additions to at_least one elementary_school and to the high_school to insure future accommodations for a school population that we know will increase . 
if they be to be commend for foresight in their planning , what then be the judgment of a town council that compound this problem during the planning stage ? 
where then be the sound planning and cooperation between agencies within the community that you have call_for in other editorials ? 
i submit that it cannot be dismiss simply by say we are not face the facts of life . 
the `` fruitful course '' of metropolitanization that you recommend is currently practice by the town of east_greenwich and have its inception long before we learn what it be called . 
for_example : 
the east_greenwich police_department utilize the radio transmission facilities of the warwick police_department , thereby eliminate duplication of facilities and ensure police coordination in the cowessett-east_greenwich-potowomut area of the two communities . 
the east_greenwich_fire_district service parts of warwick as_well as east_greenwich . 
the taxpayers of east_greenwich appropriate sums_of_money , as do other kent_county communities , for the support of the kent_county_memorial_hospital , a regional facility . 
the east_greenwich_free_library receive financial support from the town of east_greenwich and the city of warwick to supplement its endowment . 
feelers were put_out_feelers last year to the city of warwick , as report in your newspapers , suggest investigation of a common rubbish disposal area to service the potowomut and cowessett areas of warwick along with east_greenwich . 
east_greenwich be one of the first rhode_island towns to enter into contract agreement with the rhode_island development_council for planning services we could not provide for ourselves . 
the education program for retarded children conduct by the east_greenwich school_system have pupils from at_least one neighboring community . 
i feel compelled to write this because i be greatly concerned with the problem of community growth_rate and the relation between types of growth in a town such_as east_greenwich . 
i believe it be an area in_which professional planners have fail to set adequate guide posts ; and yet they cannot ignore this problem because it concern the implementation of nearly all the planning programs they have devise . 
these programs be volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must stand aside while land developers tell them when , where , and in_what_manner the community shall grow . 
we have far less to fear in the migrant family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions . 
until professional planners meet this situation squarely and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts , i hope we in east_greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny . 
i would like very_much , on behalf of my husband and myself , to send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful people responsible_for the gabrielle_fund . 
it be indeed true , as state in the famous novel of our day , `` for whom the bell tolls '' , that `` no man be an island , entirely of itself ; every man be a_piece of the continent , a part of the main '' . 
thanks to the generosity of mr._irving_j._fain , president of the temple_beth_el ; rev._dewitt_clemens , pastor of the mathewson_street methodist_church ; mr._felix_miranda , of the imperial_knife_co. ; and to mrs._rozella_switzer , regional director of the national_conference of christians and jews , who ask them to serve as a committee for the fund . 
it be through them that we have become aware of the divine humanity in man , and therefore , that most people be noble , helpful and good . 
bless you my friends , for it be through love and service that brotherhood become a reality . 
i be a sophomore at mount_pleasant high_school . 
my future plans be to become a language teacher . 
of_course , have this desire , i be very interested in education . 
a_few weeks ago , i read in the bulletin that there be to be give chinese classes in cranston . 
the article also say that a person have to be 18 years old or over , and must not be go_to high_school to attend these classes . 
the following week , i read in the sunday paper that the students of russia begin european and asian languages in the seventh grade . 
i wish you could see the situation as i see it . 
if russian pupils have to take these languages , how_come american students have a choice whether or not to take a language , but have to face so many exceptions ? 
i do not think that america be like russia , not in_the_least ! 
i be proud of my country , the small city i live in , my wonderful parents , my friends and my school ; but i be also a young , able and willing girl who want to study the chinese language but be not old enough . 
then people wonder why russian pupils be more advanced than american students . 
well , there lie your answer . 
at the height of the first snowstorm we have , it be impossible for me to get medical attention needed during an emergency . 
however , the east_providence_rescue squad make_one's_way its way through to my home in_time of desperation . 
words cannot tell of the undivided attention and comfort their service give to me . 
the concern they feel for me be such_as i shall never forget and for which i will always be grateful . 
the rescue squad is to be praise immensely for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather . 
had they not get me to the hospital when they did , perhaps i would not be here to commend them at this time . 
many thanks for a job well do . 
the providence_sunday_journal article ( jan. 29 ) ask whether american taxpayers are being victimize by a gigantic giveaway to pay for the care of war veterans who have non-service-connected disabilities sound as though the providence_journal be desperate for news . 
usually a veteran have to hang himself to get space on the front page . 
on the question of admission to veterans_administration hospitals of service-connected and non-service-connected disabled veterans , it must be recognize that there are many men who be greatly affected by war service . 
it can manifest itself before discharge from service , or it can come_out years later . 
there is one other point we should never lose sight of : many veterans who enter va hospitals as non-service cases later qualify as service-connected . 
no psychiatrist could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its effect in the ensuing years . 
the arguments advance by those individuals and groups who oppose the system in_force and who would drastically curtail or do_away entirely with hospital_care for the non-service-connected case , seem to be coldly impractical and out-of-step with the wishes of the general public . 
i believe_in priority for service-connected disabled veterans in admission to va hospitals . 
but i do n't believe we should close the door on nonservice-connected patients . 
this matter be of great importance , and the outcome may mean the difference between life or death , or at_least serious injuries , for many veterans . 
some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital be too long . 
there 's a reason for this length of stay . 
first_of_all , the admitting physician in the va hospital get the patient as a new patient . 
he have no experience with this veteran 's previous medical_record . 
if the doctor be conscientious , he want to study the patient . 
as a result , it take a_little longer than it would on_the_outside where the family physician know about the patient . 
secondly , the va physician know that when the patient leave the hospital , he is no_longer going_to have a chance to visit his patient . 
so he keep_in the veteran in until he can observe the effects of treatment or surgery . 
the american public must be present with the facts concerning va hospitalization . 
the public should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a va hospital , the tax dollar has to be pay one way or the other . 
the responsibility is still going_to be there whether they pay for a va hospital or the tax dollar is spend for the state hospital . 
an adequate system of va hospitals be better equipped to care for the veterans than any 50 state hospitals . 
it seem that open season upon veterans ' hospitalization be once_more upon us . 
the american_medical_association is once_again grind_out its tear-soaked propaganda base upon the high cost of the veterans_administration medical program to the american taxpayer . 
do they , the a._m._a. , offer any solution other_than outright abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world ? 
we veterans acknowledge the fact that as time pass the demand for medical_care at va hospitals will grow proportionately as age foster illness . 
nevertheless , we wonder at the stand of the a._m._a. on the health_problem confront the aged . 
they oppose the forand bill , which would have place the major burden of financial support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction ; yet they support the eisenhower administration which will cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars ( match incidentally by a federal grant ) to initiate . 
no_doubt there have be moments during every presidency when the man in the white_house has have feelings of frustration , exasperation , exhaustion , and even panic . 
this we can sympathetically understand . 
but no president ever before refer to his as a `` lousy job '' [ as walter_trohan recently quote president_kennedy as doing in conversation with sen._barry_goldwater ] . 
during his aggressive campaign to win his present position , mr._kennedy be vitriolic about this country 's `` prestige '' abroad . 
what does he think a remark like this `` lousy '' one does to our prestige and morale ? 
if the president_of_the_united_states really feel he win himself a `` lousy job '' , then heaven help us all . 
defense_secretary_robert_s._mcnamara has ask congress for authority and funds to build fallout shelters cost about 200 million dollars . 
why should congress even consider allow such a sum for that which can give no protection ? 
top scientists have warn that an area hit by an atomic missile of massive power would be engulf in a suffocating fire storm which would persist for a long_time . 
the scientists have also warn that no life above ground or underground , sheltered or unsheltered could be expect to survive in an area at_least 50 miles in_diameter . 
this sum spend for foreign economic aid , the peace_corps , food for peace , or any other program to solve the problems of the underdeveloped countries would be an investment that would pay_off in world peace , increased world trade , and prosperity for every country on the globe . 
let us prepare_for peace , instead of for a war which would mean the end of civilization . 
it seem college be n't what it should be . 
i refer to the attire wear by the students . 
upon a visit to a local junior_college last week , i be shocked to see the young_ladies wear short shorts and the young_men wear bermuda_shorts . 
be this what our children are to come face_to_face with when they be ready for college in a_few years ? 
education should be uppermost in their minds , but with this attire how can anyone think it be so ? 
it look more like they are going_to play at the beach instead of taking lessons on better themselves . 
high_school students have more sense of the way to dress than college_students . 
many high_school students go_past my house every_day , and they look_like perfect ladies and gentlemen . 
no_matter_how hot the day , they be dressed properly and not in shorts . 
the granting of the jan_masaryk award august 13 to senator_paul_douglas be a bitter example of misleading minorities . 
douglas has consistently vote to aid the people who kill masaryk , and against principles masaryk die to uphold . 
douglas has vote for aid to communists and for the destruction of individual freedom [ public housing , foreign aid , etc . ] . 
in today 's `` voice '' , the cta is urge to reduce fares for senior_citizens . 
rising costs have increase the difficulties of the elderly , and i would be the last to say they should not receive consideration . 
but why be it the special responsibility of the cta to help these people ? 
why should cta regular riders subsidize reduced transportation for old people any_more than the people who drive their own cars or walk to work should ? 
the welfare of citizens , old and young , be the responsibility of the community , not_only of_that part of_it that ride the cta . 
cta regulars already subsidize transportation for school children , policemen , and firemen . 
in_reply to a letter in today 's `` voice '' urge the sale of meat after 6 p. m. , i wish to state the other side of the story . 
i be the wife of the owner of a small , independent meat market . 
my husband 's hours away_from_home for the past years have be from 7 a. m. to 7 p. m. the early part of the week , and as late as 8 or 9 on week-ends . 
now he is apparently expect to give_up his evenings - and sundays , too , for this is come . 
there is a trend to package meat at a central source , freeze it , and ship it to outlying stores , where meat cutters will not be required . 
if a customer wish a special cut , it will not be available . 
we are slowly being regiment to having everything package , whether we want it or not . 
most women , in_this age of freezers , shop for the entire week on week-ends , when prices be lower . 
also , many working wives have children or husbands who take_over the shopping chores for them . 
independent market owners work six days a week ; and my husband has n't have a vacation in 14 years . 
no , we be not greedy . 
but if we close the store for a vacation , we would lose our customers to the chain_stores in the next block . 
the meat cutters ' union , which have a history of be one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area , represent the little corner markets as_well as the large supermarkets . 
what it is try to do be to protect the little man , too , as_well as try to maintain a flow of fresh meat to all stores , with choice of cut being make by the consumer , not the store . 
i , too , congratulate the american_legion , of_which i be proud to have be a member for more_than 40 years , on the recent state convention . 
i regret that bertha_madeira [ today 's `` voice '' ] obtain incorrect information . 
had i been grant the floor on a point of personal privilege , the_matter she raise would have been clarify . 
the resolution under discussion at the convention be to require the boards of election to instruct judges to properly display the american flag . 
judges under the jurisdiction of the chicago board of election commissioners are instruct to do this . 
the resolution further ask that polling_place proprietors affix an attachment to their premises for the display of the flag . 
it be my desire to advise the membership of the legion that the majority of polling_places be on private_property and , without an amendment to the law , we could not enforce this . 
my discussion with_reference_to the resolution be that we should commend those citizens who serve as judges of election and who properly discharge their duty and polling_place proprietors who make available their private premises , and not by innuendo criticize them . 
at_no_time did i attempt to seek approval or commendation for the members of the chicago board of election commissioners for the discharge of their duties . 
the illinois_commission for handicapped children wish to commend the recent announcement by the catholic charities of the archdiocese of chicago and depaul university of the establishment of the institute for special_education at the university for the training of teachers for physically handicapped and mentally_retarded children . 
in these days of serious shortage of properly trained teachers qualified to teach physically handicapped and mentally handicapped children , the establishment of such an institute will be a major contribution to the field . 
the illinois_commission for handicapped children , which for 20 years has have the responsibility of coordinate the services of tax supported and voluntary organizations serve handicapped children , of study the needs of handicapped children in illinois , and of promote more adequate services for them , indeed welcome this new important resource which will help the people of illinois toward the goal of provide an education for all_of its children . 
i just want to let you know how much i enjoy your june 25 article on liberace , and to thank you for it . 
please do put more pictures and articles in about liberace , as he be truly one of our greatest entertainers and a really wonderful person . 
be this , perhaps , one of the things that be wrong with our country ? 
engineering graduates of illinois_institute of technology are report receive the highest average starting salaries in the school 's history - $ 550 a month . 
my son , who has complete two years in engineering_school , have a summer job on a construction project as an unskilled laborer . 
at a rate of $ 3.22 an hour he is now earn approximately $ 580 a month . 
ironic , be it not , that after complete years of costly scientific training he will receive a cut in pay from what he is receive as an ordinary unskilled laborer ?

your july 26 editorial regarding the position of attorney_general robert_f._kennedy on prospective tax relief for du_pont stockholders is base on an erroneous statement of fact . 
as a result , your criticism of attorney_general robert_f._kennedy and the department_of_justice be inaccurate , unwarranted and unfair . 
the editorial concern legislative proposals to ease the tax burden on du_pont stockholders , in connection with the united_states supreme_court ruling that du_pont must divest itself of its extensive general motors stock holdings . 
these proposals would reduce the amount of tax that du_pont stockholders might have to pay - from an estimated 1.1 billion dollars under present law to as little as 192 million dollars . 
congressman_wilbur_d._mills , chairman of the house ways and means committee , ask the department_of_justice for its views on these legislative proposals as they relate to anti-trust law_enforcement . 
the attorney_general respond by letter dated july 19 . 
copies of_this letter were make available to the press and public . 
in_this letter , mr._kennedy make it clear that he limit his comment only to one consideration - what effect the legislative proposals might have on future anti-trust judgments . 
there are a_number_of other considerations besides this one but it be for the congress , not the department_of_justice , to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation . 
yet your editorial say : `` now the attorney_general write that no considerations ' justify any loss of revenue of_this proportion '' ' . 
what mr._kennedy , in_fact , write be : `` it be the department 's view that no anti-trust enforcement considerations justify any loss of revenue of_this proportion '' . 
the editorial , by omit the words anti-trust enforcement , totally distort mr._kennedy 's views . 
the headline be offensive , particularly in_view of the total inaccuracy of the editorial . 
i concur most heartily with today 's letter on the futility of write to sen._dirksen and sen._douglas . 
but when you write to congresswoman_church , bless her heart , your letter is answer fully and completely . 
should she disagree , she explain why in_detail . 
when she agree , you can rest assured her position will remain unchanged . 
i think we have the hardest work , best representative in congress . 
a recent news_story report that frank_sinatra and dean_martin delay 103 airplane passengers 10 minutes in london while they finish their drinks . 
they do our country great harm by such actions . 
those in_the_public_eye should be good_examples of american citizens while abroad . 
the plane should have start at the scheduled time and leave sinatra and martin to guzzle . 
overt socialism mean government ownership and management of a nation 's main industries . 
in covert socialism - toward which america is move - private enterprise retain the ownership title to industries but government thru direct intervention and excessive regulations actually control them . 
in_order_to attract new industries , 15 states or more are issue tax free bonds to build government owned plants which are lease to private enterprise . 
this be a step toward overt socialism . 
issue bonds for plant construction has bring new industries to certain regions . 
sir - we are write in reference_to a recent `` suggestion '' make to the staff of the public_health_nursing_service of jersey_city ( registered professional nurses with college background and varying experiences ) . 
the day before election_day , to_which we are entitle as a legal_holiday , we were inform to report to our respective polls to work as `` workers of the party '' . 
be ethical and professional people interested in community health and well-being , we feel this be n't a function of our position . 
such tactics reek of totalitarianism ! 
as we understand , this directive was give to all city and county employes . 
to our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employ because of political affiliation . 
we , therefore , consider the `` suggestion '' an insult to our intelligence , ethics , bill_of_rights , etc. . 
our only obligation for this day be to vote , free_of persuasion , for the person we feel be capable in direct the public . 
this be our duty - not as nurses or city employes - but as citizens of the united_states . 
sir - i read of a man who feel he should not build a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to sit secure while his neighbors have no shelters . 
does this man live in a neighborhood where all be free loaders unwilling to help themselves , but ready_to demand that `` the community '' help and protect them ? 
community shelters be , of_course , necessary for those have no space for shelter . 
if in a town of 2000 private homes , half of them have shelters , the need for the community shelters will be reduce to that extent . 
in design his home fallout shelter there is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that home 's occupants , `` plus-one '' - so he will be able to take_in a stranger . 
i hope the man who plan to sit on his hands until the emergency come will have a change of heart , will get busy and be the first member of our `` plus-one '' shelter club . 
sir - people continue to inquire the reason for the race for outer_space . 
it be simple enough from my point_of_view . 
i be for it . 
it be the only method left for a man to escape_from a woman 's world . 
sir - when the_colonies decide upon freedom from england , we insist , through the declaration_of_independence , that the nations of the world recognize us as a separate political entity . 
it be high_time the united_states begin to realize that the god-given rights of men set_forth in_that document be applicable today to katanga . 
in the united_nations charter , the right of self-determination be also an essential principle . 
this , again , apply to katanga . 
the people of katanga had fight for , and obtain , their freedom from the communist yoke of antoine_gizenga , and his cohorts . 
by political , economic , geographic and natural standards , they be justified in doing so . 
the united_states and the u._n. denounce their own principles when they defend the communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge the right of self-determination of the katangans . 
sir - permit me to commend your editorial in_which you stress the fact that a program of county colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers have a right to a clear idea of_what such a program would commit them to . 
the bill which pass the assembly last may and be now pending in the senate should be give careful scrutiny . 
the procedure for determine the amounts_of_money to be spend by county colleges and raise by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers . 
under the proposal the members of the board_of_trustees of a county college will be appoint ; none will be elect . 
the trustees will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board of school estimate . 
this board will consist_of two of the trustees of the college , and the director and two members of the board of freeholders . 
it will determine the amount_of_money to be spend by the college and will certify this amount to the board of freeholders , which `` shall appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations are make by it the amount so certified and the amount shall be assess , levy and collect in the same manner as moneys appropriate for other purposes '' . 
the approval of only three members of the board of school estimate be required to certify the amount_of_money to be allot to the college . 
since two of these could be trustees of the college , actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected_official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax_revenue . 
this be taxation without representation . 
sir - your editorial , `` housing speedup '' , be certainly not the answer to our slum problems . 
the very rules and regulations in every city be the primary case of slum conditions . 
change our taxing law so_that no tax shall be charge to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties . 
then see what a boom in_all trades , as_well as slum clearance at no cost to taxpayers , will happen . 
our entire economy will have a terrific uplift . 
sir - an old_man is kick to death by muggers . 
the medical_examiner state that death be due to `` natural causes '' . 
i once hear a comedian say that if you are kill by a taxicab in new_york , it is list as `` death due_to natural causes '' . 
sir - every resident of_this city should visit the newark_museum and see the exhibit `` our changing skyline in newark '' . 
it will be at the museum until march 30 . 
it be a revelation of_what has been do , what is being do and what will be do in newark as show by architects ' plans , models and pictures . 
it show what a beautiful city newark will become and certainly make every newarker proud_of this city . 
it should also make him desire to participate actively in civic , school and religious life of the community so_that that phase of newark will live_up_to the challenge present by this exhibit . 
sir - i hasten to join in praise of the men in the toll booths on the garden_state parkway . 
recently i travel the parkway from east_orange to cape_may and i find the_most courteous group of men you will find anywhere . 
one even give my little_dog a biscuit . 
it be very refreshing . 
the viewers of the `` deep peep_show '' at 15 th and m streets nw. have an added attraction - the view of a fossilized cypress swamp . 
twenty feet below the street level in the excavation of the new motel to be construct on this site , a black coal-like deposit has been encounter . 
this be a black swamp clay in_which about one_hundred million years ago cypress-like trees were grow . 
the fossilized remains of many_of these trees are find embedded in the clay . 
some of the stumps be as much_as three feet long , but most_of them have been flatten by the pressure of the overlying sediments . 
although the wood has been change to coal , much of_it still retain its original cell structure . 
in the clay are entomb millions of pollen grains and spores which come from plants grow in the region at_the_time . 
these microfossils indicate the swamp was `` form during the lower cretaceous_period when dinosaurs be at their heyday and when the first flowering_plants were just appear . 
the 15 th street deposit be not to be confuse with the nearby famous mayflower_hotel cypress swamp on 17 th street report in the washington_post , august 2 , 1955 , which was probably form during the second interglacial period and be therefore much younger . 
recently the secretary of the friends committee on national legislation was interview on the air . 
while i respect his sincere concern for peace , he make four points that i would like to question . 
he say , `` let 's work for peace instead of protection from aggression '' . 
i would ask , `` why not do both '' ? 
military power does not cause war ; war be the result of mistrust and lack of understanding between people . 
be we not_late , especially those of us who call ourselves friends , in do enough about this lack of understanding ? 
as to protection , the speaker disapprove of shelters , point_out that fallout shelters would not save everyone . 
be this a reason for save no one ? 
would the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his boat could not pick_up everyone ? 
the speaker suggest that the desolation of a post-attack world would be too awful to face . 
if the world come to this , would n't it be the very time when courage and american know-how would be need to help survivors rebuild ? 
many_of our young people think it would . 
lastly , the speaker decry our organized program of emergency help call it `` civilian_defense '' . 
in 1950 , public_law 920 create civil_defense ( different from civilian-groups of world_war 2 , ) , a responsibility of the government at_all levels to help reduce loss of life and property in disaster , natural or manmade . 
far from create fear , as the speaker suggest , preparedness - know what to do in an emergency - give people confidence . 
civil_defense have far to go and many problems to solve , but be it not in the best spirit of our pioneer tradition to be not_only willing , but prepared to care for our own families and help our neighbors in any disaster - storm , flood , accident or even war ? 
it seem rather peculiar that residents of apartments are deny the right of provide themselves with the protection and companionship of dogs . 
i feel that few burglars would be prone to break and enter into someone 's apartment if they were meet with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide . 
in_addition , would not the young female public of washington be afford a greater degree of protection at night when they be on the streets if they were accompany by a dog on a leash ? 
i grant that the dog may not be really protective , base on his training , but if you were roam the streets look_for a purse to snatch or a young_lady to molest , how quick would you be to attack a person stroll with a dog ? 
i would like to suggest that the landlords and commissioners get together and consider liberalize the practice of prohibit dogs in apartments . 
use the terraces of the capitol for a sidewalk cafe ? 
could senator_humphrey be serious in his proposal ? 
be nothing in_this country more sacred than the tourists ' comfort ? 
perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could be extend . 
the lincoln and jefferson_memorials be rather bleak . 
why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel too far to eat ? 
unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money to support themselves during the off season . 
as an added suggestion to balance the budget , the government could sell advertising space on the washington_monument . 
it be visible throughout the city , and men from madison_ave. would jump at the chance . 
sen._hubert_humphrey be obviously a man with a soul and heart . 
he , like most_of us , want to be able to sit , to contemplate and be move by the great outdoors . 
let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas around fountains and gardens . 
let us , like the_french , have outdoor cafes where we may relax , converse at_leisure and enjoy the passing crowd . 
two strong dissents from the majority report of the joint_economic_committee ( may 2 ) by senators proxmire and butler allege that the new_deal fiscal policy of the thirties did not work . 
for_the_first_time in history the entire world be dominated_by two large , powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear_weapons that make conventional warfare of the past a nullity . 
the united_states and soviet_russia have enough nuclear_weapons to destroy all nations . 
recent statements by well-known scientists regarding the destructive power of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead of negotiations . 
president_kennedy be right when he say , `` we shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate '' . 
i have just return from a seven-week trip to europe and the far_east . 
it be quite evident that the people of western europe be overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war . 
the fact be that the italians , french and british know that they have no defense against nuclear bombs . 
we have no right to criticize them , as they realize they would be sitting_ducks in a nuclear war . 
we should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access into berlin . 
it would be criminal folly if the communists try to prevent us . 
but there be nothing we can do to stop soviet_russia from grant de_facto recognition to east_germany . 
soviet_russia has been invade twice by german troops in a generation . 
in the last war russia lose more_than ten million kill and its lands and factories were devastate . 
the truth be that communist_russia fear the resurgence of german militarism . 
berlin is merely being use by moscow as a stalking_horse . 
actually , the communists , out of fear of a united and armed germany , would probably be willing to agree to a disarmed germany that would be united and neutral and have its independence guarantee by the u._n. . 
if the communists be sincere in want a united , neutral and disarmed germany , it might well be advantageous for the german people in_this nuclear age . 
it could provide security without cost of armaments and increase german prosperity and lessen taxation . 
france and other western european_nations likewise fear a rearmed germany . 
if the german people favor such a settlement we should not oppose germany follow the example of austria . 
president_kennedy has urge a peace race on disarmament that might be called `` operation_survival '' which have many facets . 
why not make a beginning with a united and disarmed germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing would be guarantee by the big four powers and the united_states ? 
a united germany , freed of militarism , might be the first step toward disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world . 
in your editorial of sept. 30 `` the smoldering congo '' you make the following comment : `` far too many states are follow the russian example in refuse to pay their assessments . 
it be up_to the assembly to take action against them . 
they are violate their charter obligation , the prescribed penalty for which be suspension of membership or expulsion '' . 
i would like to quote from the charter of the united_nations : 
`` article 17 , section 1 : the general_assembly shall consider and approve the budget of the organization . 
`` section 2 : the expenses of the organization shall be bear by the members as apportion by the general_assembly . 
`` article 19 : a member of the united_nations which be in_arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the organization shall have no vote in the general_assembly if the amount of its arrears equal or exceed the amount of the contributions due from_it for the preceding two full years '' . 
the u._s._s._r. and her followers be careful in pay their obligations to the regular budget . 
but they refuse , as do the arab states , to support the united_nations ' expenses of maintain the united_nations emergency_force in_the_middle east as a buffer between egypt and israel , and the u._n. troops in the congo , which expenses are not cover by the regular budget of the united_nations , but by a special budget . 
according to the official interpretation of the charter , a member cannot be penalize by not have the right_to_vote in the general_assembly for nonpayment of financial_obligations to the `` special '' united_nations ' budgets , and of_course cannot be expel from the organization ( which you suggest in your editorial ) , due_to the fact that there be no provision in the charter for expulsion . 
in your sept. 27 editorial appraisal of the work of the first session of the eighty-seventh_congress you refer to the lack of `` consciousness of destiny in a time of acute national and world peril '' . 
yet your list of things leave undone did not include repeal of the connally amendment to this country 's domestic jurisdiction reservation to its adherence to the statute of the international_court_of_justice . 
the connally amendment say that the united_states , rather_than the court , shall determine whether a matter be essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the united_states in a case before the world_court to_which the united_states be a party . 
if the case is thus determine by us to be domestic , the court have no jurisdiction . 
since the connally amendment have the effect of give the same right to the other party to a dispute with the united_states , it also prevent us from use the court effectively . 
yet although the kennedy_administration , and the eisenhower_administration before it , have both declare themselves solidly for repeal of the connally amendment , as contrary to our best interests , no action has yet been take . 
our `` destiny '' in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit of peace , with justice , under law . 
to achieve this destiny , acts as well as words are need - not_only acts that lead to physical strength but also acts that lead to strength base on right doing and respect . 
what better affirmative step could be take to this end than repeal of the connally amendment - an act which could expose the united_states to no practical risk yet would put an end to our self-judging attitude toward the court , enable us to utilize it , and advance in a tangible way the cause of international_law and order ? 
we believe that the list of vital things leave undone to_date by the eighty-seventh_congress should have include repeal by the senate of the connally amendment . 
many home-bound subway riders utilize the flushing-main_street express are daily confront with the sight of the local depart from the woodside station as their express comes_to a stop , leave them stranded and strained . 
to the tens of thousands who must transfer to ride to seventy-fourth_street and change for the ind , this takes a daily toll of time and temper . 
the transit_authority has recently placed in_operation `` hold '' lights at bmt_thirty-ninth and fifty-ninth_street stations in brooklyn . 
this `` hold '' the local until the express passengers change trains . 
without question , this time and temper saver should be immediately install at the woodside station . 
as a business man i have to use the telephone constantly , from three to four hours a day . 
in the last few years the telephone_company has manage to automate many areas of their service . 
it has not be any great mental effort on my part to keep_up with this mechanization which has bring_about new ways of dialing . 
however , there be still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone_operators . 
i have been absolutely shock at the ineptness of the young_ladies who are service person-to-person calls , special long-distance_calls , etc. . 
either it be lack of training , lack of proper screening when hire , lack of management or possibly lack of interest on the part of the telephone_company , which does have a government-blessed monopoly . 
i disagree with the writer who say funeral services should be government-controlled . 
the funeral for my husband be just what i want and i pay a fair price , far less_than i had expect to pay . 
but the hospitals and doctors should be . 
recently i visit the very remarkable pilgrim_school for retarded children . 
hazel_park donate its recreation center , five days a week , to the school . 
there be no charge and no state aid . 
kiwanis , american_legion and other groups donate small sums and the mothers do what they can to bring_in dollars for its support . 
there be 70 children there and the mothers donate one_day a week to the school . 
reading , writing and simple arithmetic are teach along with such crafts as work in brass . 
they make beautiful objects . 
enough trading_stamps were collect to buy a 12 - passenger station_wagon . 
southfield schools furnish an old 45 - passenger bus ( the heater in_which need repair since some of the children ride a long distance and need the heat ) . 
the school be located at 9 - 1 2 mile road , woodward_heights . 
visitors be welcome to come see what these dedicated mothers can do . 
i be surprised at mayor_miriani 's defeat , but perhaps mayor-elect_cavanagh can accomplish some things that should have been do years ago . 
maybe he can clean_out the white_elephants in some of the city departments such_as welfare , dpw and sanitation . 
negligence in garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning be great . 
he should put the police back to patrolling and walking the streets at night . 
there should be better bus_service and all_of our city departments and their various branches need a general and complete overhauling . 
our litterbug ordinances are not enforce and i have yet to read of a conviction in a littering case . 
drunken truck_drivers in the city departments should be weed_out . 
educate the city employes to give real service to the public . 
after_all , they are pay by the public , they should be examples . 
at a recent meeting of the women 's association of the trumbull_ave._united presbyterian_church , considerable use was make of material from the detroit_news on the king_james_version of the new_testament versus the new_english_bible . 
some members of the organization called attention also to the article on hymns of inspiration , the daily_prayer and three minutes a day , as be very helpful . 
we feel that the detroit_news be to be compliment upon arrange for articles on these subjects and we hope that it will continue to provide material along wholesome lines . 
thank_you for the article by george_sokolsky on the public apathy to impudence . 
how old do you have to be to remember when americans , especially children , were encourage to be polite ? 
why has this form of gentility go_out of american life ? 
how can we old-fashioned parents , who still feel that adults be due some respect from children , battle the new type of advertising that appear on tv without deny the children the use of television entirely ? 
writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of `` modern '' parents they have observe . 
from necessity , they are also inspire by the `` hard-sell '' attitude of the sponsor , so , finally , it be the sponsor who must take the responsibility for the good or bad taste of his advertising . 
i commend senator_hart for his brave fight to establish a national_park in the dunes area . 
i just wish to congratulate inspector_trimmer and his efficient police troops in clean the city of those horrible automobiles . 
we have now a quiet city , fewer automobiles , less congestion , and fewer retail customers shop in center city . 
good for mr._trimmer . 
maybe he will help to turn_into our fair city into a `` ghost '' town . 
i work_on the schuylkill_expressway and if it had not been for the big trucks carry rock and concrete there would n't be an expressway . 
without these massive trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future . 
mr._george_hough ( oct. 30 ) sound like a business man who wait until the last minute to leave his home or shop . 
the trucks today help pay for this highway . 
they try to keep within the speed_limits . 
although today 's trucks be as fast as passenger_cars , a truck_driver has to be a sensible person and guard against hog the road . 
the letter_writer who suggest save money by take_out kids out of school at 14 should have sign his letter `` simpleton '' instead of `` simplicitude '' . 
such kids only wind_up among the unemployed on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden . 
there be lots_of jobs available for trained high_school graduates , but not for the dropouts . 
what we need be more vocational training in high_schools , not more dropouts . 
i suppose i am miss some elementary point but i honestly cannot see how two wrongs can make a right ! 
i am refer to this country conduct atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because russia is . 
will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less harmful to future generations of children ? 
if an atom_bomb in 1945 could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have be more_than adequate_to fulfill any military objective require of_it . 
as i see it , if war start and we survive the initial attack enough to be able to fight_back , the nuclear_weapons we now have - at_least the bombs - can inflict all the demage that be necessary . 
why do we need bigger and better bombs ? 
i repeat , two wrongs do not make a right . 
everyone should take time to read martin_luther 's hymn `` a mighty_fortress be our god '' . 
especially the first_half of the third verse . 
to our everlasting shame , we lead the world in_this nuclear arms_race sixteen years ago when we drop the first bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki . 
having lead the world in_this mad race i pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead it out of the race . 
are we to be the master of the atom , or will the atom be our master - and destroy us ! 
just because cheddi_jagan , new boss of british_guiana , was educate in the united_states be no reason to think he be n't a red . 
we have quite_a_few home-grown specimens of our own . 
if we go_all_gooey over this newest castro ( until he prove he be n't ) we 've get rocks in our heads . 
how many_times must we get burned before we learn ? 
just to remind the communists that the bombs drop on japan be to end a war not start one . 
the war could have continue many years with many thousands kill on both sides . 
intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets of destruction be frightening whether they fall on japan , london or pearl_harbor . 
that be why the united_nations was form so_that intelligent men with good intentions from all countries could meet and solve problems without resort to war . 
russia has show its intentions by explode bombs in peace time to try to frighten the world . 
why are n't the soviets expel from the u._n. ? 
while `` better late than never '' may have certain merits , the posthumous award of the nobel_prize for peace to the late dag_hammarskjold strike me as less_than a satisfactory expression of appreciation . 
had it been bestow while the secretary_general of the united_nations be living , unquestionably he would have be greatly encouraged in pursue a difficult and , in many ways , thankless task . 
according to one report , however , mr._hammarskjold was consider `` too controversial '' a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last spring . 
actually , of_course , that label `` controversial '' apply only because he was carry_out the mandate give him by the world_organization he head rather_than follow the dictates of the soviet_union . 
at khrushchev 's door , therefore , can be place the primary blame but also at_fault be those who permit themselves to be intimidate . 
it be well for us to remember that a wreath on a coffin never can atone for flowers withhold while they still can be enjoy . 
as has happen so often in_the_past , the ability to recognize true greatness has be inadequate and tardy . 
just a brief note of appreciation to vice_president johnson and pakistani camel driver bashir_ahmad for provide a first-class example of `` people to people '' good_will . 
if only this could be do more_often - with such heartening results - many_of the earth 's `` big problems '' would shrink to the insignificances they really be . 
p._s. . 
thanks for your good coverage of ahmad 's visit , too ! 
your continuing editorials concerning the schuylkill_expressway be valuable ; however , several pertinent considerations deserve recognition . 
one of the problems associated with the expressway stem from the basic idea . 
we shuffle a large percentage of the cars across the river twice . 
they start on the east_side of the schuylkill , have to cross over to the west to use the expressway and cross over_again to the east at their destination . 
bridges , tunnels and ferries be the_most common methods of river crossings . 
each one of these be , by its nature , a focal_point or a point of natural congestion . 
we should avoid these congestion points or , put it another way , keep ars start and end on the east_side of the river - on the east_side . 
this can be accomplish by several logical steps : 
widen the east_river drive at least one lane . 
so widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage problems . 
paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead directional lights as on our bridges . 
one additional lane would then be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the traffic carrying_capability of the east_river_drive by fifty_percent . 
this could be accomplish without the tremendous expenditures necessitate by the schuylkill_expressway and without destroy the natural beauty of the east_river_drive . 
i wish to advocate two drastic changes in washington_square : 
take_away george_washington 's statue . 
replace it with the statue of one or another of the world 's famous dictators . 
there 's no sense in being remind of times that were . 
washington_square seem not part of a free land . 
it may remind one of russia , china or east_berlin ; but it can n't remind one of the freedom that washington and the continental soldiers fight for . 
the fairmount_park_commission will no_doubt approve my two proposals , because it be responsible_for the change of ideological atmosphere in the square . 
the_matter may seem a small thing to some people , i know , but it be a very good start on_the_road to totalitarianism . 
the commission has post signs in washington_square say : 
the feeding of birds be prohibited in_this square . 
fairmount_park_commission does each tentacle of the octopus of city_government reach_out and lash at whatever it dislike or consider an annoyance ? 
if birds do n't belong in a square or park , what does ? 
they be the_most beautiful part of_that little piece of nature . 
the trees be their homes ; but the commission does not share such sentiments . 
the whole official city apparently have an intense hatred toward birds . 
starlings and blackbirds are scare_off by cannon , from city_hall . 
just a preliminary measure . 
if any be left , presently , we may expect to see signs specifically prohibit the feeding of them too . 
the city_government be not united in an all-out , to-the-death drive to stamp_out gangs , delinquents , thugs , murderers , rapists , subversives . 
indeed no . 
let every policeman and park guard keep his eye on john and jane_doe , lest one piece of bread be place undetected and one bird survive . 
of_course , in_this small way of force the people to watch as tiny and innocent and dependent creatures die because we be afraid to feed them and afraid to protest and say `` how_come ? 
what 's your motive ? 
who want this deed do '' ? 
- in_this small way do the leaders of a city , or of a nation , inure the masses to watch , or even inflict , torture and death , upon even their fellow men . 
one means to help the_birds occur to me : let the chimes that ring over washington_square twice daily , discontinue any piece_of_music but one . 
let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody has be the joy of mankind since time begin , the hymn `` abide with me '' . 
we will know , and he will know , to whom it is render , what the_birds would ask . 
there be a trend today to bemoan the fact that americans be too `` soft '' . 
unfortunately , those who would remedy our `` softness '' seek to do so with calisthenics . 
they are work_on the wrong part of our anatomy . 
it be not our bodies but our hearts and heads that have grow too soft . 
ashamed of our wealth and power , afraid_of so-called world opinion and addicted to peace , we have allow our soft-heartedness to lead to soft-headed policies . 
when we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which we know to be right , when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations which do not permit self-determination , when we become strong enough to resist any_more drifts towards socialism in our own nation , when we recognize that our enemy be communism not war , and when we realize that concessions to communists do not insure peace or freedom , then , and only then will we no_longer be `` soft '' . 
america does n't need to `` push-up '' , she need to stand_up ! 
the new column by maurice_stans regarding business scandals , be fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem have some merit . 
however , he state unequivocally `` the scandals in business be far less significant than the scandals in_labor '' . 
i must , in fairness , take_issue with his premise , primarily because the so-called scandals in_labor unions be very_much connected with business scandals . 
the area most prominently comment on during the mcclellan hearings have to do with `` sweetheart contracts '' . 
these arrangements would have be impossible if the business_community be truly interested in the welfare of its employes . 
a sweetheart arrangement can come_about as often by employers do the corrupting as by unscrupulous labor_leaders demand tribute . 
anyone familiar_with the details of the mcclellan hearings must at_once realize that the sweetheart arrangements augment employer profits far more_than they augment the earnings of the corruptible labor_leaders . 
further , it should be recall that some very definite steps were take by congress to combat corruption in the labor_movement by its passage of the landrum-griffin_act . 
all false gods resemble moloch , at_least in the early phases of their careers , so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol-worship to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice . 
but there is reason in_all things , and in_this country the heathenish cult of the motor-car is exceed all bounds in its demands . 
the annual butchery of 40000 american men , women and children to satiate its blood-lust be excessive ; a quota of 25000 a year would be more_than sufficient . 
no other popular idol is accord even that_much grace . 
if the railroads , for_example , regularly slaughter 25000 passengers each_year , the high_priests of the cult would have cause to tremble for their personal safety , for such a holocaust would excite demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the united_states . 
but by comparison with the railroad , the motor car be a relatively new object of popular worship , so it be too_much to hope that it may be bring within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily . 
yet it be plainly time to make a start , and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic , without be fanatical . 
here , then , is what swift would have call a modest proposal by way of a beginning . 
from next new_year 's day let us keep careful account of each successive fatality on the highways , publicize it on all media of communication . 
to avoid suspicion of bigotry , let the hand of vengeance be stay until the meat-wagon has pick_up the twenty-five thousandth corpse ; but let the twenty-five thousand and first butchery be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state_highway commissioners . 
then let the whole lot be hang in a public mass execution on july 4 , 1963 . 
the scene , of_course , should be nine miles northwest of centralia , illinois , the geographical center of population according_to the census . 
a special grandstand , protected by awnings from the midsummer sun of illinois , should be erect for occupancy by honored guests , who should include the ambassadors of all those new african_nations as_yet not_quite convinced that the united_states be thoroughly civilized . 
the band should play the rogues ' march as a processional , switch to `` hail_columbia , happy_land '' ! as the trap is spring . 
independence_day be the appropriate date as a symbolical reminder of the american article of faith that governments are institute among men to secure to them certain inalienable rights , the first of_which be life , and when any government become subversive of_that end , it be the right of the people to alter or abolish it . 
the highway_system be an agency of government , and when it grind up 40000 americans every_year the government is destroy its own taxpayers , which be obviously a silly thing for any government to do . 
hang the responsible officials would not abolish the government , but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual citizens , which would certainly alter it , and definitely for the better . 
moreover , the salubrious effects would not be exclusively political , but at_least partially , and perhaps primarily social . 
it would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some of its ancillary beliefs and practices - for_instance , the doctrine that the fulfillment of life consist_in proceed from hither to yon , not for any advantage to be gain by arrival but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of stasis , or , as_it_is generally term , staying_put . 
true , the adherents of staying_put are now reduce to a minor , even a miniscule sect , and their credo , `` home-keeping hearts be happiest '' , be as disreputable as socinianism . 
nonetheless , although few in number they be a stubborn crew , as tenacious of life as the hardshell baptists , which suggest that there is some kind_of vital_principle embody in their faith . 
perhaps there is more truth than we be wont_to admit in the conviction of_that ornament of tarheelia , robert_ruark 's grandfather , who was persuade that the great curse of the modern_world be `` all this gallivantin '' ' . 
in_any_event , the yearly sacrifice of 40000 victims be a hecatomb too large to be justify by the_most ardent faith . 
somehow our contemporary moloch must be induce to see reason . 
since appeals to morality , to humanity , and to sanity have have such small effect , perhaps our last recourse be the deterrent_example . 
if we make it established custom that whenever butchery on the highways grow excessive , say beyond 25000 per_annum , then somebody is going_to hang , it follow that the more eminent the victim , the more impressive the lesson . 
to hang 50 governors might be preferable except that they be not directly related_to the highways ; so , all things consider , the highway commissioners would seem to be elect . 
as the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth , the soviet_union stand guilty of a monstrous crime against the human_race . 
but the guilt is share by the united_states , britain and france , the other members of the atomic club . 
until moscow resume nuclear testing last september 1 , the us and uk had release more_than twice_as much radiation into the atmosphere as the russians , and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still come_down . 
as it descend , the concentration of radioactivity build_up in the human_body ; for a dose of radiation be not like a flu virus which cause temporary discomfort and_then die . 
the effect of radiation be cumulative over the years - and on to succeeding generations . 
so , while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning , history be not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the west be so quick to assume when mr._khrushchev make his cynical and irresponsible threat . 
shock , dismay and foreboding for future generations be legitimate reactions ; a holier-than-thou sermon be not . 
on october 19 , after the soviets had detonate at_least 20 nuclear devices , ambassador_stevenson warn the un general_assembly that this country , in `` self protection '' , might have to resume above-ground tests . 
more recently , the chairman of the atomic_energy commission , dr._glenn_t._seaborg , `` admit '' to a news_conference in las_vegas , nevada , that the us might fall_behind russia ( he apparently mean in weapons development ) if the soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain . 
the trial_balloons be afloat . 
all_of which make it more imperative than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood . 
but for the average citizen , unfortunately , this be one of science 's worst-marked channels , full_of tricky currents and unknown depths . 
the scientists , in and out of government , do not agree on some of the_most vital points , at_least publicly . 
on_the_one_hand , the public_health_service declare as recently as october 26 that present radiation levels result from the soviet shots `` do not warrant undue public concern '' or any action to limit the intake of radioactive substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the us . 
but the phs concede that the new radioactive particles `` will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations , and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the united_states '' . 
then it add : `` it be not possible to determine how extensive these ill effects will be - nor how many people will be affect '' . 
having hedge its bets in_this_way , phs apparently decide it would be possible to make some sort_of determination after_all : `` at_present radiation levels , and even at somewhat higher levels , the additional risk be slight and very_few people will be affect '' . 
then , to conclude on an indeterminate note : `` nevertheless , if fallout increase substantially , or remain high for a long_time , it would become far more important as a potential health hazard in_this country and throughout_the_world '' . 
dr._linus_pauling , a nobel_prize winner in chemistry , has be less ambiguous , whether you choose to agree with him or not . 
after declare , in an article last month in frontier magazine , that the russian testing `` carry with_it the possibility of the_most tragic consequences of any action in the history of the world '' , he give this estimate of the biologic and genetic consequences if the new soviet shots total 200 megatons : 
the damage to human germ_plasm would be such_that in the next few generations 160000 children around the world would be_born with gross physical or mental defects . 
long-lived carbon-14 from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic , neonatal or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations , and between 200000 and one million human_beings now living would have their lives cut_short by radiation-produced diseases such_as leukemia . 
most_of these would be in the northern_hemisphere , where the fallout is concentrate . 
pauling 's estimate of 200 megatons yield from the present series of russian tests will probably turn_out to be too high , but a total of 100 megatons be a distinct possibility . 
the lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation be_due in_part to insufficient data cover large population groups , from which agreed-on generalizations could be draw . 
but more_than one conscientious researcher has been inhibit from completely frank discussion of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout has been make a political issue as_well as a scientific problem . 
its dangerous effects have been downgrade to the public by some who believe national security require further testing . 
an illustration of_this attitude is find in john_a._mccone 's letter to dr._thomas_lauritsen , report in a note elsewhere in_this issue of the new_republic . 
to this day the atomic_energy commission shy_away_from discuss the health aspects of fallout . 
a recent study on radiation exposure by the aec 's division of biology and medicine state : `` the question of the biological effect of [ radiation ] doses is not consider '' herein . 
of_course , the aec be in a bind now . 
if it come_down too hard on the potential dangers of fallout , it will box the president on resume atmospheric tests . 
so the commission 's announcements of the new soviet shots have been confine to one or two bleak sentences , with the fission yield usually leave vague . 
now , of_course , that the russians be the nuclear villains , radiation be a nastier word than it be in the mid-1950s , when the us was test in the atmosphere . 
the prevailing official attitude then seem to be that fallout , if_not exactly good_for_you , might not be much worse than a bad cold . 
after a nuclear blast , one bureaucrat suggest in those halcyon days , about all you had to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof . 
things be n't that simple anymore . 
yet if washington get too indignant about soviet fallout , it will have to do a_lot_of fast footwork if america decide it too must start push_up the radiation count . 
as of october 25 , the aec had report 24 shots in the new soviet series , 12 of them in a megaton range , include a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons ( the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million tons of tnt ) ; and president_kennedy indicate there be one or two more_than those report . 
assume the lower figure for the big blast and one_shot estimate by the japanese at 10 megatons , a conservative computation be that the 24 announced tests produce a total yield of at_least 60 megatons . 
some government scientists say privately that the figure probably be closer to 80 megatons , and that the full 50 - megaton_bomb that khrushchev mention may still be detonate . 
if the new soviet series has follow the general pattern of previous russian tests , the shots be roughly half fission and half fusion , mean a fission yield of 30 to 40 megatons thus_far . 
to this must be add the 90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produce between the dawn of the atomic age in 1945 and the informal three-power test moratorium that begin in november , 1958 . 
one of the inescapable realities of the cold_war be that_is has thrust upon the west a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas . 
the first dilemma be the morality of nuclear warfare itself . 
that dilemma be as much with us as ever . 
the second great dilemma has be the morality of nuclear testing , a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of soviet tests . 
when this second dilemma first become obvious - during the mid to late ' 50 's - the united_states appear to have three choices . 
it could have unilaterally abandon further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations . 
it could have continue testing to_the_full on the grounds that the radiation danger be far less_than the danger of communist world domination . 
or it could have choose to find - by negotiation - some way of stop the tests without loss to national security . 
this third choice was in_fact make . 
with the resumption of soviet testing and their intransigence at the geneva talks , however , the hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shake . 
once_again , the united_states must choose . 
and once_again , the choices be much the same . 
only this time around the conditions be different and the choice be far harder . 
the first choice , abandon tests entirely , would not_only be unpopular domestically , but would surely be exploit by the russians . 
the second choice , full testing , has become even more risky just because the current soviet tests have already dangerously contaminate the atmosphere . 
the third choice , negotiation , presuppose , as russian behavior demonstrate , a great_deal of wishful_thinking to make it appear reasonable . 
we take the position , however , that the third choice still remain the only sane one open_to us . 
it be by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the arguments against it as a practical strategy be formidable . 
its primary advantage be that it be a moral choice ; one which , should it fail , will not have contaminate the conscience . 
that be the contamination we most fear . 
leave aside the choice of unilateral cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral , the question must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part would not be a good choice . 
for that be the one an increasingly large_number of prominent americans are now propose . 
in_particular , governor_nelson_rockefeller has express as cogently and clearly as anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests . 
speak recently in miami , governor_rockefeller say that `` to assure the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent soviet tests , we are now clearly compel to conduct our own nuclear tests '' . 
take_account of the fact that such a move on our part would be unpopular in world opinion , he argue that the responsibility of the united_states be `` to do , confidently and firmly , not what be popular , but what be right '' . 
what be missing in the governor 's argument , as in so many similar arguments , be a premise which would enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable to what be right . 
the possibility , as he assert , that the russians may get_ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests does not supply the needed ethical premise - unless , of_course , we have unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now take as a moral demand . 
besides the lack of an adequate ethical dimension to the governor 's case , one can ask seriously whether our lead over the russians in quality and quantity of nuclear_weapons be so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary . 
recent statements by the president and defense_department spokesmen have , to_the_contrary , assure us that our lead be very great . 
unless the administration and the defense_department have been deceive us , the facts do not support the assertion that we be `` compelled '' to resume atmospheric testing . 
it be perfectly conceivable that a resumption of atmospheric tests may , at some point in_the_future , be necessary and even justifiable . 
but a resumption does not seem justifiable now . 
what we need to realize be that the increasingly great contamination of the atmosphere by the soviet tests has radically increase our own moral_obligations . 
we now have to think_of not_only of our national security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests we might undertake . 
this be an ethical demand which cannot be evade or gloss_over by talk exclusively of weapon superiority or even of the evil of communism . 
too often in_the_past russian tactics have been use to justify like tactics on our part . 
there ought_to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless_of what russia do . 
the refusal to resume atmospheric testing would be a good start . 
when his holiness pope_john 23 , first call_for an ecumenical_council , and at_the_same_time voice his yearning for christian unity , the enthusiasm among catholic and protestant ecumenicists be immediate . 
with good reason it appear that a new day be upon divided christendom . 
but as the more concrete plans for the work of the council gradually become known , there be a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on_all_sides . 
the council we now know will concern itself directly only with the internal affairs of the church . 
as it has turn_out , however , the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of hope in the second be both wrong responses . 
two things have happen in recent months to bring the council into perspective : 
each provide a basis for renewed hope and joy . 
first_of_all , it is now know that pope_john see the renewal and purification of the church as an absolutely necessary step toward christian unity . 
far from be irrelevant to the ecumenical task , the pontiff believe that a revivified church be required in_order that the whole world may see catholicism in the best possible light . 
equally significant , pope_john has say that catholics themselves bear some responsibility for christian disunity . 
a major aim of the council will be to remove as_far_as_possible whatever in the church today stand in the way of unity . 
secondly , a whole series of addresses and actions by the pope and by others show that concern for christian unity be still very_much alive and growing within the church . 
the establishment , by the holy_father , of a permanent secretariat for christian_unity in 1960 be the_most dramatic mark of_this concern . 
the designation of five catholic theologians to attend the world_council of churches assembly in new_delhi as `` official '' observers reverse the church 's earlier stand . 
the public appeal by the new vatican secretary_of_state , cardinal_cicognani , for renewed efforts toward eastern and western reunion be still another remarkable act . 
nor can one forget pope_john 's unprecedented meeting with the archbishop of canterbury . 
augustin_cardinal_bea , the director of the secretariate for christian_unity , has express as directly as anyone the new spirit that pervade the church 's stance toward the protestant and orthodox_churches . 
note all the difficulties that stand in the way of reunion , he has say that they ought not to discourage anyone . 
for discouragement , or the temptation to abandon our efforts , `` would show that one place excessive trust in purely human means without think of the omnipotence of god , the irresistible efficacy of prayer , the action of christ or the power of the divine_spirit '' . 
can any christian fail to respond to these words ? 
the administration 's official budget review , which estimate a 6.9 billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal_year , is n't make anyone happy . 
certainly it is n't make the president happy , and he has been do his apologetic best to explain how the budget get into its unbalanced condition , how he intend to economize wherever he can and_how he hope to do better next year . 
we sympathize with mr._kennedy , but we feel bound to say that his budget review does n't please us either , although for very different reasons . 
furthermore , we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying than reassuring . 
in_the_first_place , a large part of the discrepancy between president_eisenhower 's estimate of a 1.5 billion dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost seven billion dollar deficit be the result of the outgoing president 's farewell gift of a political booby-trap to his successor . 
the eisenhower budget be simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be receive . 
the rest of the deficit be also easily understood . 
four billion dollars of the spending increase be for defense , an expenditure necessitate by the penny-wise policies of the eisenhhower_administration , quite apart from the recent crises in berlin and elsewhere . 
four_hundred million dollars of the increase be for the expanded space program , a responsibility similarly neglect by mr._eisenhower . 
the farm program will cost an additional 1.5 billion , because of unusual weather factors , the food for peace program and other new measures . 
anti-recession programs - aid for the unemployed , their children and for depressed areas - account_for only 900 million of the 6.9 billion dollar deficit . 
our complaint be that in many crucial areas the kennedy programs be not too large but too small , most seriously in regard_to the conventional arms build-up and in aid and welfare measures . 
and yet mr._kennedy persist in try to mollify the intransigents of the right with apologies and promises of `` tightening_up '' and `` economizing '' . 
we wish the president would remember that `` fiscal responsibility '' be the battle-cry of the party that lose the election . 
the party that win used_to say something about a new_frontier . 
introduction of the `` dialogue '' principle prove strikingly effective at the thirty-fourth annual meeting of the catholic_association for international_peace in washington the last weekend in october . 
two of the principal addresses were deliver by prominent protestants , and when the speaker be a catholic , one `` discussant '' on the dais tended_to be of another religious persuasion . 
several effects be immediately evident . 
sessions devoted_to `` ethics and foreign_policy trends '' , `` moral_principle and political judgment '' , `` christian_ethics in the cold_war '' and related subjects prove to be much livelier under this procedure than if catholics were merely talk to themselves . 
usually questions from the floor were direct to the non-catholic speaker or discussion leader . 
in the earlier sessions there be plentiful discussion on the natural_law , which dr._william_v._o ' brien of georgetown_university , advance as the basis for widely acceptable ethical judgments on foreign_policy . 
that aristotelean-thomistic principle experience a thorough going-over from a_number_of the participants , but in_the_end the concept came to reassert itself . 
speakers declare that protestants often make use of it , if , perhaps , by some other name . 
a lebanese moslem tell about its existence and application in the islamic tradition as the `` divine law '' , while a c._a._i._p. member who has been work in close association with delegates of the new u._n. nations tell of its widespread recognition on the african continent . 
the impression be unmistakable that , whatever one may choose to call it , natural_law be a functioning generality with a certain objective existence . 
another question that arise be the nature of the dialogue itself . 
the stimulus from the confrontation of philosophical systems involve certain differences be undeniable . 
it was expect that the comparison of different approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each other 's positions and better comprehension of one 's own . 
but a realization that each group have much of substance to learn from the other also develop , and a strong conviction grow that each have insights and dimensions to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political issues . 
one effect of the spirited give-and-take of these discussions be to focus attention on practical_applications and the necessity of be armed with the facts : knowledge of the destructive force of even the tiniest `` tactical '' atomic weapon would have a bearing on judgments as to the advisability of its use - to defend berlin , for_example ; the pervasive influence of ideology on our political judgments need to be recognize and take_into_account into due account ; it be necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demand by the christian imperative . 
everywhere i go in formosa i ask the same question . 
i was search for an accent of self-delusion or , even , of hypocrisy . 
i never find it among any of the chinese with whom i speak , though granted they be , almost all , members of the official family who , presumably , harbor official thoughts . 
but i question , also , professional soldiers , who would not easily be hypnotize by a septuagenarian 's dreamy irredentism . 
their answer be : it can be do , and we will do it . 
and_then i put the question as pointedly as i could directly to chiang_kai-shek : `` in america '' , i say , `` practically no one believe that you subjectively intend to re-enter the mainland . 
what evidence is there of an objective kind that in_fact your government propose to do just that , and that it can be do '' ? 
he smile . 
( he always smile - at_least at visitors , i gather . 
he smile also at a british bloke seat next to me , who ask the_most asinine questions . 
i recall sympathetically the duke 's complaint in browning 's `` my last duchess '' . 
he smile , and say a word or two to the interpreter , who turn_to me , `` the president wonder where you are go after you leave taipei '' ? 
that , i smart , be a royal rebuff if ever there was one . 
i answer the routine question about my itinerary , rather coolly . 
chiang speak again , this time at greater length . 
`` the president say '' , the translator come_in , `` that the reason he ask you where you were go be because he hope you would be visit other areas in southeast_asia , and that everywhere you go , you would seek the answer to your question . 
he say that if he were to express to you , once_again , his own profound determination to go to the mainland , and his faith that that return be feasible , he would merely sound redundant . 
so you yourself must seek these objective data , and come to your own conclusions . 
any information we have here in taiwan be at your disposal '' . 
fair enough . 
what be the relevant data ? 
for every person on taiwan , there be sixty in mainland_china . 
if the raw population figures be crucially relevant , then it be idle to think_of liberation , as idle as to suppose that poland might liberate russia . 
relative military manpower ? 
less_than 60 - 1 , but at_least 6 - 1 . 
the estimates vary widely on the strength of the chinese army . 
say four million . 
the armed_forces of taiwan be at a working strength of about 450000 , though a reserve potential twice that high is contemplate . 
skill ? 
training ? 
morale ? 
it is generally concede that the formosan air_force be the best by_far in asia , and the army the best trained . 
the morale be very high . 
even_so , it add_up to impossible odds , except that the question arise , on whose side would the mainland chinese army fight ? 
the miserable people of china , the largest cast ever conscript to enact an ideological passion_play , cannot themselves resist overtly . 
they think , perforce , of physical survival : everything else be secondary . 
but the army which mao continue to feed well , where be its sympathies ? 
the psychological strategists in taiwan stress the great sense of family , cultivate in china over thousands of years . 
it has not been extirpate by ten years of communist depersonalization . 
every soldier in the army have , somewhere , relatives who be close_to starvation . 
the soldiers themselves cannot stage a successful rebellion , it is assume : but will their discontent spread to the officer class ? 
the immediate families of the generals and the admirals be well_fed : a despot does not economize on his generals . 
but there are the cousins and aunts and nephews . 
their privations be almost beyond endurance . 
in behalf of_what ? 
leninism-marxism , as understand by exegete_mao . 
to whom will the generals stay loyal ? 
there is little doubt if they have a secret ballot , they would vote for food for their family , in_place of ideological purity out on the farm . 
it be another question whether `` they '' - or a single general , off in a corner of china , secure for a_few ( galvanizing ? ) 
days at_least from instant retaliation - will defy the party . 
but the disposition to rebel be most definitely there . 
but there must be a catalytic pressure . 
the military in taiwan believe that the communists have make two mistakes , which , together , may prove fatal . 
the first be the commune program , which will ensure agricultural poverty for years . 
the family be largely broken_up ; and where it be not , it is leave with no residue , and the social meaning of_this be enormous . 
for it be the family that , in china , has always provide social_security for the indigent , the sick , the down-and-out members of the clan . 
now the government must do that ; but the government is leave with no reserve granary , under the agricultural system it has ordain . 
thus the government simultaneously undertake the vast burden of social_security which had traditionally been privately discharge , and create a national scarcity which has engender calamitous problems of social_security . 
the second mistake be tibet . 
tibet has historically serve china as a buffer_state . 
a friendly state , sometimes only semi-independent , but never hostile . 
china never try to integrate tibet by extirpate the people 's religion and institutions . 
red_china is try to do this , and she be not likely ever to succeed . 
tibet be too vast , the terrain be too difficult . 
tibet may bleed china as algeria is bleed france . 
these continuing pressures , social , economic and military , are do much to keep china in a heightening state of tension . 
the imposition of yet another pressure , a strong one , from_the_outside , might cause it to snap . 
the planners in taiwan strike me as realistic men . 
they know that they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control . 
first_and_foremost , they depend_on the inhuman idiocies of the communist regime . 
on these they feel they can rely_on . 
secondly , they depend_on america 's `` moral cooperation '' when the crucial moment arrive . 
they hope that if history vouchsafe the west another budapest , we will receive the opportunity gladly . 
i remark jocularly to the president that the future of china would be far more certain if he would invite a planeload of selected american liberals to quemoy on an odd day . 
he affect ( most properly ) not to understand my point . 
but he - and all_of china - wear the scars of american indecisiveness , and he know what an uncertain ally we be . 
we have be grand to formosa itself - lots_of aid , and , most_of the time , a policy of support for the offshore islands . 
but our outlook has be , and continue to be , defensive . 
a great_deal depend_on the crystallization of mr._kennedy 's views on the world struggle . 
the free chinese know that the situation on the mainland be in flux , and are poise to strike . 
there is not_anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized force for liberation . 
the moment of truth be the moment of crisis . 
during the slow buildup , the essence of a policy or a man is conceal under embroidered details , fine words , strutting gestures . 
the crisis burn these suddenly away . 
there the truth be , open_to eyes that be willing to look . 
the moment pass . 
new self-deceiving rags are hurriedly toss on the too-naked bones . 
a truth-revealing crisis erupt in katanga for a_couple_of days this month , to be quickly smother by the high_pressure verbal fog that_is keep on_tap for such emergencies . 
before memory , too , cloud_over , let us make a note or two of_what could be see . 
the measure was instantly take , as always in such cases , of public men at many levels . 
one know better , now , who have bone and who have jelly in his spine . 
but i be here concerned more with policy than with men . 
public men come and go but great issues of policy remain . 
now , everyone know - or know in the week of december 10 - that something had go_wrong shockingly wrong with american foreign_policy . 
the united_states was engage in a military attack on a peaceful , orderly people govern by a regime that had prove itself the_most pro-western and anti-communist within any of the new nations - the only place in africa , moreover , where a productive relationship between whites and blacks had apparently been achieve . 
of_course the fighting be officially under the auspices of the united_nations . 
but in the moment of truth everyone could see that the u._s. be in_reality the principal . 
the moment simultaneously reveal that in the crisis our policy run counter to_that of all our nato allies , to the entire western community . 
by our policy the west be - be - split . 
but the key revelation be not new . 
the controlling pattern was first display in the hungary-suez crisis of november 1956 . 
it reappear , in whole or part , whenever a new crisis expose the reality : in cuba last spring ( with which the dominican events of last month should be pair ) ; at the peaks of the nuclear test and the berlin cycles ; in_relation_to laos , algeria , south_africa ; right_now , with almost cartoon emphasis , in the temporally linked complex of tshombe-gizenga-goa-ghana . 
this prime element of the truth may be state as_follows : 
under prevailing policy , the u._s. can take the initiative against the right , but cannot take the initiative against the left . 
it make no difference what part of the world be involved , what form of regime , what particular issue . 
the u._s. cannot take the initiative against the left . 
there be even some question whether the u._s. can any longer defend itself against an initiative by the left . 
we can attack tshombe , but not gigenza . 
no_matter that gizenga be moscow 's man in the congo . 
no_matter that it be his troops who rape western women and eat western men . 
no_matter that the katanga operation be strategically insane in_terms_of western interests in africa . 
( even granted that the congo should be unify , you do n't protect western security by first remove the pro-western weight from the power equilibrium . ) 
we can force britain and france out of the suez , but we cannot so_much as try to force the russian tanks back from budapest . 
we can mass our fleet against the trujillos , but not against the castros . 
we can vote_in the un against south_african apartheid or portuguese rule in angola , but we cannot even introduce a motion on the berlin_wall - much less , give the simple order to push the wall down . 
we officially receive the anti-french , moscow-allied algerian fln , but we denounce the pro-europe , anti-communist oas as criminal . 
in the very week of our war against katanga , we make a $ 133 million grant to kwame_nkrumah , who has just declare his solidarity with the communist bloc , and is busily turn his own country into a totalitarian dictatorship . 
as our planes land the war materiel that kill pro-western katangans , we stand supinely bleat while nehru 's troops smash into a five-hundred-year-old district of our nato ally , portugal . 
what explain this uni-directional paralysis ? 
it be the consequence of the system of ideas that constitute the frame of our international - and in some degree our domestic - policy . 
the suez-hungary crisis prove that this system was not invent by the new administration , but only make more consistent and more active . 
most immediately relevant to these episodes in goa , katanga and ghana , as to the suez-hungary crisis before them , be the belief that the main theater of the world drama be the underdeveloped region of asia , africa and latin_america . 
from this belief is derive the practical orientation of our policy on the `` uncommitted '' ( `` neutralist '' , `` contested '' ) nations , especially on those whose leaders make the_most noise - nehru , tito , nkrumah , sukarno , betancourt , etc. . 
our chief aim become that of find favor in neutralist eyes . 
if we grasp this orientation as a key , our national conduct in_all of the events here mention become intelligible . 
and it become clear why in_general we cannot take the initiative against the left . 
to write a play , the dramatist once need an idea plus the imagination , the knowledge of life and the craft to develop it . 
nowadays , more_and_more , all he need be someone else 's book . 
to get_started , he does not scan the world about him ; he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists . 
so_far this season , broadway 's premieres have include twice_as many adaptations and imports as original american stage plays . 
of straight dramas , there be all_the_way home , which owe much of its poetic power to the james_agee novel , a death in the family ; the wall , awkwardly base on the john_hersey novel ; advise and consent , lively but shallow theater draw from the mountainously detailed bestseller ; face of a hero ( closed ) , base on a pierre_boulle novel . 
the only original works attempt to reach any stature : tennessee_williams ' disappointing domestic comedy , period of adjustment , and arthur_laurents ' clever but empty invitation to a march . 
clearly the_most provocative plays be all imported originals - a taste_of honey , by britain 's young ( 19 when she write it ) shelagh_delaney ; becket , by france 's jean_anouilh ; the hostage ( closed ) , by ireland 's brendan_behan . 
among the musicals , camelot come from t._h._white 's the once and future_king , and novels be the sources of the less_than momentous tenderloin and do re_mi . 
wildcat and the unsinkable_molly_brown be originals , but pretty bad , leave top honors again to an import - the jaunty and charmingly french irma_la_douce . 
the only other works at least technically original be dreary farces - send me no flowers ( closed ) , under the yum-yum_tree , critic 's choice . 
in the forthcoming the conquering_hero and carnival , broadway is not even adapt books , but reconvert old movies ( hail the conquering_hero and lili ) . 
originals be not necessarily good and adaptations be not necessarily bad . 
some memorable plays have been draw from books , notably life with father and diary of anne_frank . 
and particularly in the musical field , adaptations have long be the rule , from die_fledermaus and the merry widow to oklahoma ! 
and my fair_lady . 
as critic_walter_kerr point_out : `` adaptations , so_long as they be good , still qualify as creative '' . 
and other defenders invariably argue that , after_all , shakespeare and moliere be adapters too . 
the difference be that the masters take the bare frame of a plot and fill it with their own world ; most modern adapters totally accept the world of a book , squeeze it dry of life , and add only one contribution of their own : 
stage technique . 
the_most frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals and tested imports be increasing production expense - producers cannot afford to take_chances . 
but that explanation be only partly true . 
off-broadway , where production be still comparatively cheap , is prove itself only slightly more original . 
laudably enough , it is offer classics and off-beat imports , but last week only one u._s. original be on the boards , robert_d._hock 's stunning civil_war work , borak . 
the real trouble seem to be the failing imagination of u._s. playwrights . 
he : `` come with me to the casbah '' . 
she : `` by subway or cab '' ? 
that exchange be not_only possible but commonplace last week in manhattan , as more_and_more new yorkers were discover 29 th street and eighth_avenue , where half_a_dozen small nightclubs with names like arabian_nights , grecian palace and egyptian gardens be the american inpost of belly_dancing . 
several more will open soon . 
their burgeoning popularity may be a result of the closing of the 52 nd street burlesque joints , but curiously enough their atmosphere be almost always familial - neighborhood saloons with a_bit of epidermis . 
the belly boites , with their papier-mache palm_trees or hand-painted ionic columns , heretofore exist mainly on the patronage of greek and turkish families . 
customers often bring their children ; between performances , enthusiastic young_men from the audience will take_the_floor to demonstrate their own amateur graces . 
except for the odd uptown sex maniac or an overeager greek sailor , the people watch in calm absorption . 
small , shirt-sleeved orchestras play in 2 4 or 4 4 time , use guitars , violins , and more alien instruments with names that would open_sesame : the oud , grandfather of the lute ; the darbuka , a small drum with the treelike shape of a roemer glass ; the def , a low-pitched tambourine . 
the girls sit quietly with the musicians , wear prim dresses or plain , secretarial shifts , until it is time to go off to a back_room and reappear in the spare uniform of the harem . 
if a dancer be good , she suggest purely and superbly the fundamental mechanics of ancestry and progeny - the continuum of mankind . 
but a great many_of what variety call the `` cooch terpers '' be considerably less cosmic than that . 
each dancer follow the ancient oriental pattern - she glide sideways with shoulders motionless while her stomach migrate , and , through breathing and muscle control , she send ripples across her body to the fingertips and away to the far end of the room . 
this is do at varying speeds , range from the slow and fast shifte_telli ( a musical term meaning double strings ) to the fastest , ecstatic karshilama ( meaning greetings or welcome ) . 
the new_york dancers be highly eclectic , vary the pattern with all kinds of personal improvisations , back bends or floor crawls . 
but they do not strip . 
the striptease be crass ; the belly_dance leave more to the imagination . 
when a dancer does well , she provoke a quiet bombardment of dollar_bills - although the manhattan clubs prohibit the more cosmopolitan practice of slip the tips into the dancers ' costumes . 
with tips , the girls average between $ 150 and $ 200 a week , depending_on basic salary . 
although they are forbid to sit with the customers , the dancers are sometimes proffer drinks , and most_of them can bolt one down in mid-shimmy . 
all_over the country , belly clubs have never be bigger , especially in detroit , boston and chicago , and even in small_towns ; one of the best dancers , a turkish girl named semra , work at a roadhouse outside bristol , conn. . 
the girls are keep booked and moving by several agents , notably voluble , black-bearded murat_somay , a manhattan_turk who be the sol_hurok of the central abdomen . 
he can offer nine turkish girls , plan to import at_least 15 more . 
but a great many_of the dancers be more_or_less native . 
sometimes they get their initial experience in church haflis , conduct by lebanese and syrians in the u._s. , where they dance with just_as few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs . 
as the girls come to belly_dancing from this and other origins , the melting_pot has never bubble more intriguingly . 
some manhattan examples : 
jemela ( surname : gerby ) , 23 , seem hong_kong oriental but have a spanish father and an indian mother , be_born in america and educate at holy_cross_academy and textile high_school , say she learn belly_dancing at family picnics . 
serene ( mrs._wilson ) , 23 , be_born in budapest and raise in manhattan . 
daughter of a gypsy mother who teach her to dance , she be one of the few really beautiful girls in the new_york casbah , with dark eyes and dark , waist-length hair , the face of an adolescent patrician and a lithe , glimmering body . 
many belly_dancers be married , but serene be one of the few who will admit it . 
marlene ( surname : adamo ) , 25 , a brazilian divorcee who learn the dance from arabic friends in paris , now live on manhattan 's west_side , be about the best belly_dancer work the casbah , love it so_much that she dance on her day_off . 
she have the small , highly_developed body of a prime athlete , and hold in contempt the `` girls who just move sex '' . 
leila ( malia_phillips ) , 25 , be a greenwich_village painter of persianesque miniatures who have red hair that cascade almost to her ankles . 
a graduate of hollywood high_school , she like to imagine herself , as she take_the_floor , `` a village girl come_in to a festival '' . 
gloria ( surname : ziraldo ) , circa 30 , who be_born in italy and once do `` chorus work '' in toronto , has be around longer than most_of the others , wistfully remember the old days when `` we used_to get the seamen from the ships , you know , with big turtleneck sweaters and handkerchiefs and all . 
but the ships be very slow now , and we do n't get so many sailors any_more '' . 
the uptown crowd has move_in , and what girl worth her seventh veil would trade a turtleneck sweater for a button-down collar ? 
of the handful of painters that austria has produce in the 20 th century , only one , oskar_kokoschka , be widely known in the u._s. . 
this state of unawareness may not last much longer . 
for ten years a small group of european and u._s. critics has been calling_attention_to the half-forgotten austrian expressionist egon_schiele , who die 42 years ago at the age of 28 . 
the critics ' campaign finally inspire the first major u._s. exhibit of schiele 's works . 
the show has be to boston and manhattan , will in_time reach pittsburgh and minneapolis . 
last week it open at the j._b. speed museum in louisville , at the very moment that a second schiele exhibit was being make ready at the felix_landau gallery in los_angeles . 
schiele 's paintings be anything but pleasant . 
his people ( see color ) be angular and knobby-knuckled , sometimes painfully stretched , sometimes grotesquely foreshortened . 
his colors be dark and murky , and his landscapes and cityscapes seem swallowed in gloom . 
but he paint some of the boldest and most original pictures of his time , and even after nearly half a century , the tense , tormented world he put on canvas has lose none of its fascination . 
the son of a railway stationmaster , schiele live most_of his childhood in the drowsy danubian town of tulln , 14 miles northwest of vienna . 
he be an emotional , lonely boy who spend so_much time turn_out drawings that he do scarcely_any schoolwork . 
when he be 15 , his parents finally allow him to attend classes at the academy of fine_arts in vienna . 
even there he did not last for long . 
cry one professor after a_few months of student_schiele 's tantrums and rebellion : 
`` the_devil himself must have defecate you into my classroom '' ! 
for_a_while his work was influence deeply by the_french impressionists , and by the patterned , mosaic-like paintings of gustav_klimt , then the dean of austrian art . 
gradually schiele evolve a somber style of his own - and he have few inhibitions about his subject_matter . 
his pictures were roundly denounce as `` the_most disgusting things one has ever see in vienna '' . 
he himself was once convict of paint erotica and jail for 24 days - the first three of_which he spend desperately try to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle . 
for years he wear hand-me-down suits and homemade paper collars , was even drive to scrounge for cigarette_butts in vienna 's gutters . 
draft into the austrian army , he rebelliously reject discipline , wangle a vienna billet , go_on paint . 
it was not until the last year of his life that he have his first moneymaking show . 
the unabashed sexuality of so many_of this paintings be not the only thing that keep the public at_bay : 
his view of the world be one of almost unrelieved tragedy , and it be too_much even for morbid-minded vienna . 
he was obsess by disease and poverty , by the melancholy of old_age and the tyranny of lust . 
the children he paint be almost always in rags , his portraits be often ruthless to_the_point of ugliness , and his nudes - include several self-portraits - be stringy , contorted and strangely pathetic . 
the subject he like most be the female_body , which he paint in every state - naked , half-dressed , muffled to the ears , sit primly in a chair , lie tauntingly on a bed or lock in an embrace . 
the_most surprising thing about the twenty-second_congress of the soviet communist_party be that it be surprising - perhaps quite as much , in its own way , as the twentieth_congress of 1956 , which end with_that famous `` secret '' report on stalin . 
the publication last july of the party 's draft program - that blueprint for the `` transition to communism '' - had lead the uninitiated to suppose that this twenty-second_congress would be a sort_of apotheosis of the khrushchev regime , a solemn consecration of ideas which had , in_fact , be current over the last three or four years ( i. e. , since the defeat of the `` anti-party group '' ) in_all theoretical party journals . 
these never cease to suggest that if , in the eyes of marx and lenin `` full communism '' be still a very distant ideal , the establishment of a communist society had now , under khrushchev , become an `` immediate and tangible reality '' . 
it seem that khrushchev himself take_pride a very special pride in having make a world-shaking contribution to marxist doctrine with his draft program ( a large part of his twelve-hour speech at the recent congress be , in_fact , very largely a rehash of_that interminable document ) . 
he and other soviet leaders responsible_for the document be proud of having bring_forward some new formulas , such_as the early replacement of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an `` all people 's state '' , and also of having lay_down the lines for a much greater `` democratization '' of the whole hierarchy of soviets , start with the supreme soviet itself . 
their plan for rotation of leaders promise a salutary blow at `` bureaucracy '' and would enable `` the people '' to take a more direct and active part in run the country . 
also , elections would be more democratic ; there might even be two or more candidates for voters to choose from . 
no_doubt , there was still a_lot in the draft program - and in khrushchev 's speech - which leave many points obscure . 
be it the party 's intention , for_example , to abolish gradually the kolkhoz system and replace it by uniformly wage-earning sovkhozes , i. e. , state farms ( which be , moreover , to be progressively `` urbanize '' ) ? 
as we know , the soviet peasant today still very largely thrive on be able to sell the produce grow on his private plot ; and it be still very far from certain how valid the party 's claim be that in `` a growing number of kolkhozes '' the peasants are find it more profitable , to surrender their private plots to the kolkhoz and to let the latter be turn_into something increasingly like a state farm . 
if one follow the reports of the congress , one find that there still seem considerable uncertainty in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this matter . 
the draft program be interesting in_other_respects , too . 
it contain , for_example , a_number_of curious admissions about the peasants , who enjoy no sickness_benefits , no old-age pensions , no paid holidays ; they still benefit far less_than the `` other '' 50 per_cent of the nation from_that `` welfare_state '' which the soviet_union so greatly pride itself on be . 
over all these fairly awkward problems khrushchev was to skate_over rather lightly ; and , though he repeat , over_and_over_again , the spectacular figures of industrial and agricultural production in 1980 , the `` ordinary '' people in russia be still a_little uncertain as to how `` communism '' is really going to work in_practice , especially in respect of food . 
would agriculture progress as rapidly as industry ? 
this be something on_which k. himself seem to have some doubts ; for he keep_on threaten that he would `` pull the ears '' of those responsible_for agricultural production . 
and , as we know , the_virgin lands are not produce as much_as khrushchev had hope . 
one cannot but wonder whether these doubts about the success of khrushchev 's agricultural policy have not at_least something to do with one of the big surprises provide by this congress - the obsessive harp on the crimes and misdeeds of the `` anti-party group '' - molotov , malenkov , kaganovich and_others - include the eighty-year-old marshal_voroshilov . 
molotov , in_particular , is being charge with all kinds of sins - especially with want to cut_down free public_services , to increase rents and fares ; in_fact , with having be against all the more popular features of the khrushchev `` welfare_state '' . 
the trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels be that we hear only one side of the story : 
what , in the secret councils of the kremlin , molotov had really propose , we just do n't know , and he has have no chance to reply . 
but one cannot escape the suspicion that all this non-stop harping_on the misdeeds of the long liquidated `` anti-party '' group would be totally unnecessary if there be not , inside the party , some secret but genuine opposition to khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds , on the actual methods to be employ in the `` transition to communism '' and , last_but_not_least , on foreign_policy . 
the whole problem of `` peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition '' with the capitalist world be in the very center of_this congress . 
mikoyan declare : 
`` molotov altogether reject the line of peaceful coexistence , reduce this concept merely to the state of peace or rather , the absence of war at a given moment , and to a denial of the possibility of avert a world_war . 
his views , in_fact , coincide with those of foreign enemies of peaceful coexistence , who look_upon it merely as a variant of the '' cold_war `` or of an '' armed peace `` '' . 
one cannot help wonder whether molotov and the rest of the `` anti-party group '' are not being use as china 's whipping-boys by khrushchev and his faithful followers . 
for something , clearly , has go_wrong very , very seriously wrong in soviet-chinese relations , which be never easy , and have now deteriorate . 
the effect of chou_en-lai 's clash with khrushchev , together with the everlasting attacks on molotov + co. , has shift the whole attention of the world , include that of the soviet people , from the `` epoch-making '' twenty-year program to the present soviet-chinese conflict . 
not_only , as we know , did chou_en-lai publicly treat khrushchev 's attack on albania as `` something that we cannot consider as a serious marxist-leninist approach '' to the problem ( i. e. , as something thoroughly dictatorial and `` undemocratic '' ) , but the albanian leaders go out of their way to be openly abusive to khrushchev , call him a liar , a bully , and_so_on . 
it be extremely doubtful that the handful of albanians who call themselves communists could have do this without the direct approval of their chinese friends . 
the big question be whether , in the name of a restored chinese-soviet solidarity , the chinese will choose to persuade the albanians to present their humble apologies to khrushchev - or get_rid_of enver_hoxa . 
these seem about the only two ways in_which the `` unhappy incident '' can now be close . 
but albania be merely a symptom of a real malaise between china and russia . 
there are other symptoms . 
khrushchev , for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable decay of capitalism , be genuinely favorable to `` peaceful coexistence '' and would like , above_all , the berlin and german problems to be settle peacefully ; he know that he be never more popular than at_the_time of the russo-american `` honeymoon '' of 1959 . 
but it seem that pressures against him are come from somewhere - in_the_first_place from china , but perhaps also from_that `` china_lobby '' which , i was assure in moscow nearly two years ago , exist on_the_quiet inside the party . 
to these people , solidarity and unity with china should be the real basis of russia 's future policy . 
and the chinese , as the albanian incident show , have strong suspicions that khrushchev be anxious to secure a `` shameful '' peace with the west . 
the fact that china ( which be obsessed by formosa - to khrushchev a very small matter ) should be support by north_korea and north_vietnam be highly indicative . 
and one cannot but wonder whether marshal_malinovsky , who was blowing hot and cold , exalt peace but also almost openly consider the possibility of preventive war against the west , was n't try to keep the chinese quiet . 
and this bring us inevitably to the 30 - or 50 - megaton_bomb . 
was not this drop primarily in_order_to `` appease '' the chinese - especially after `` khrushchev 's '' humiliating `` surrender to the west in cancel the german peace-treaty deadline of december 31 ? 
what does it all add_up to ? 
indications be that khrushchev ( and , with him , the bulk of the soviet people ) favor peaceful coexistence and ( with the exception of berlin ) the maintenance of the status_quo in the world . 
the chinese , north vietnamese and north koreans , on_the_other_hand , feel that , militarily , russia be strong enough to support them in the `` just wars of liberation '' they would like to embark_on before_long : 
with china attack formosa and the north koreans and north vietnamese liberate the southern half of their respective countries . 
perhaps khrushchev be in a more difficult position than any since 1957 , when the `` anti-party group '' nearly liquidate him . 
he seem strong enough inside the party to cope_with any internal opposition ; but if he be up against china 's crusading spirit in world affairs , he is going_to be face with the_most agonizing choice in his life . 
he may support china ( but he won n't ) ; he may break_with china ( which would be infernally difficult and perhaps disastrous ) , or he may succeed , by all kinds of dangerous concessions , in persuade china to be patient . 
the next days may show where things stand . 
on a misty sunday morning last month , a small band of militant anti-communists called the minutemen hold maneuvers in a foggy field about fifteen miles east of here . 
eleven men , a woman and a teen-age boy tramp over cold , damp , fog-enshrouded ground during a two-hour field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare . 
to the average american , this must sound like an incredible tale from a saturday night tv movie . 
but to the minutemen , this be a serious business . 
they feel that the united_states is engage in a life-and-death struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy . 
they feel that world_war 3 , has already begin , and they are set_up themselves up as a `` last line_of_defense '' against the communist advance . 
their national_leader , robert_bolivar_depugh of norborne , mo. , say the minutemen believe that guerrilla tactics be best suited to defeat the red onslaught . 
in their maneuvers last month , they wear world_war 2 , camouflage garb and helmets , and carry unloaded m-1_rifles . 
the maneuvers were hold `` in_secret '' after a regional seminar for the minutemen , hold in nearby shiloh , ill. , had been break_up the previous day by deputy_sheriffs , who had arrest regional leader richard_lauchli of collinsville , ill. , and seize four operative weapons , include a browning machine_gun , two browning automatic_rifles and an m-4 rifle . 
undismayed by this contretemps , a small band of the faithful gather at lauchli 's home at 6 : 30 a._m. the next day , put_on their uniforms , and head for a farm several miles away . 
a 60 mm. mortar and a 57 mm. recoilless rifle own by lauchli were bring along . 
the mortar be equipped with dummy shells and the recoilless rifle be deactivated . 
after a tortuous drive in an open truck and a world_war 2 , army jeep down soggy trails , the band arrive_at a small clearing squeezed between a long , low ridge and a creek-filled gully . 
here the two leaders , depugh and lauchli , hasten to put the group through its paces . 
the minutemen were instruct in the use of terrain for concealment . 
they were show how to advance against an enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge . 
they practice movement behind a smoke_screen lay by smoke_grenades ; and they attempt a skirmish line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment . 
eleven dummy rounds were fire by lauchli in a demonstration of rapid-fire mortar shooting . 
mrs._depugh , the mother of five children and an active member of her husband 's organization , participate in_all the exercises . 
there be no `` casualties '' , but the `` guerrillas '' admit to be `` a_little tired '' when the leaders call a halt at 9 a._m. to enable out-of-town members to catch a plane . 
i would like to add one more practical reform to those mention by russell_kirk [ dec. 16 ] . 
it have to do with teachers ' salaries and tenure . 
next september , after receive a degree from yale 's master_of_arts_in_teaching program , i will be teach somewhere - that_much be guaranteed by the present shortage of mathematics_teachers . 
i will also be underpaid . 
the amazing thing be that this too is cause by the dearth of teachers . 
teaching be at_present a sellers ' market ; as a result buyers , the public , must be satisfy with second-rate teachers . 
but this be not the real problem ; the rub arise from the fact that teachers are usually pay on the basis of time serve rather_than quality . 
hence all teachers , good and bad , who have been teach for a given number of years are pay the same salary . 
i be firmly convinced that consider the average quality of teachers in_this country , the profession be grossly overpaid . 
it follow that teachers as_a_group cannot expect any marked salary increases ; there is a limit to how much the public will pay for shoddy performance . 
the only hope which good teachers have for being pay their due be to stop drag the dead weight of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them . 
the only hope which the public have for get good teachers be to pay teachers on the basis of merit rather_than tenure . 
here , as in_all sectors of the economy , quality and justice be both dependent_on the right of the individual to deal directly with his employer if he so choose . 
on the eve of the `` great debate '' on the proposal to give the president broad powers to make across-the-board tariff concessions which could practically bring us into the atlantic_community , we should face the alternatives on this proposition . 
what we will be sacrifice in any such arrangement will be our power to be selective which is contain in the reciprocal trade principle under which we now operate . 
without this power we lay open any american industry which the europeans may find it economically profitable to destroy to the will of others . 
it be this loss of initiative in how we conduct our economy which may lead to the loss of initiative in how we conduct our political affairs . 
i disagree with mr._burnham 's position on the common_market [ nov. 18 ] as a desirable organization for us to join . 
for him to ignore the political consequences involve in an atlantic_union of_this kind be difficult to understand . 
the pressure for our entry to the common_market is mount and we will proceed towards this amalgamated trade_union by way of a purely `` economic thoroughfare '' , or garden path , with the political ramifications keep neatly in the background . 
the appeal is going_to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing to those who do not see its relation_to political and legal , as_well as economic , self-rule . 
in enter this union we will be surrender most , if_not all , of our economic autonomy to international bodies such_as the atlantic_institute ( recently set_up ) or the o._e._c._d. , i._m._f. and_others . 
to think that we can merely relinquish our economic autonomy without give_up our political or legal autonomy be wishful_thinking . 
if it be not enough that all_of our internationalist one worlders are advocate that we join this market , i refer you to an article in the new_york times ' magazine section [ nov. 12 , 1961 ] , by mr._eric_johnston , entitled `` we must join the common_market '' . 
he say : `` it has sweep aside petty nationalisms , age-old rivalries , and worn-out customs '' . 
refer to britain , he say , `` we see a nation that traditionally value sovereignty above_all else willing to give_up its economy , place this authority in continental hands '' . 
since the goal of our international planners be a world_government , this atlantic_community would mark a giant step in that direction for , once american economic autonomy is absorb , a larger grouping be a question of time . 
frankly , it is being very cleverly do for , in_a_sense , they have us over a barrel . 
listen to what mr._johnston have to say : `` consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict . 
we would lose our export markets and deny ourselves the imports we need . 
we would be cripple by reduced output , industrial decline , widespread unemployment '' . 
but the solution to this dilemma be not the incorporation of the united_states into an atlantic_community or `` economic empire '' , but merely what libertarians like henry_hazlitt and ludwig_von_mises have been argue for years : an end to government regulations , an end to government competition in industry , and a realistic depreciation_allowance for industry . 
create a free market here , give us a sound , debt-free money system , and we 'll compete with anyone , europe and asia combined . 
in_short , get this governmental monstrosity off our backs and we won n't have to worry about european competition or communism either . 
if we want to preserve our sovereignty , this be the way to do it ; not acquiesce to an international planning_board . 
if we go_into this common_market , we might just_as well stop talk_about constitutional guarantees , connally amendments or , for_that_matter , conservatism in_general . 
we welcome this able brief for the negative as part of a many-sided discussion of the atlantic common_market which nr will be continue in our pages .

the peiping chinese be the only major silver seller in the world markets who stop sell the metal on monday morning , november 27 , anticipate by two days the announcement of the u._s._treasury that the pegged offering price will be remove . 
in 1954 i was draft and after serve two years honorably on active duty i was not require to participate in any further army_reserve activities . 
now , more_than five years later , i cannot in any realistic sense be call a trained soldier . 
but , in_spite_of this , i , at_present a man 31 years of_age and a college_professor , have been recall `` by direction of the president '' to report on november 25 th to fort_devens , massachusetts , for another twelve months of active duty as an sp 4 ( the equivalent of a pfc ) . 
today , seven years after the date of my initial induction as a draftee , i be assistant_professor of philosophy and science at st._michael 's college . 
for , after leave the army in 1956 , i spend five years in graduate_school first at boston_college and_then at the university of toronto . 
this time , added_to that which i had already spend in school prior to my induction in 1954 , make a total of twenty-two ( 22 ) years of education . 
the possibility of recall into the army be part of the price that a modern american have to pay for the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoy . 
with this no loyal citizen can quarrel . 
however , it seem axiomatic that the government have an obligation `` to exercise its mandate reasonably , equitably and with full regard for the disruptions which it inevitably cause '' . 
in my own case , i submit that such reasonable and fair exercise be woefully lacking . 
take_back into the army now as an sp 4 , i am leave 110 college_students whose teacher i be . 
( a wry sidelight on this be that most_of my students have deferments from the draft in_order_to attend my classes . ) 
at this late date , it be impossible for st._michael 's college to find a suitable replacement for me . 
even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal life is being totally disrupt for the second time for no very compelling reason - i cannot help look_around at the black leather jacket brigades stand idly on the street_corners and in the taverns of every american city and ask myself if our society has go mad . 
in news broadcasts i consistently hear the foreign volunteers fight in the katanga_army refer to as mercenaries . 
this confuse me no_end . 
if the hessian troops send here willy-nilly by the hessian government to fight for england in the 1770 's be mercenaries , what shall we call the un troops send to the congo willy-nilly by their governments to fight for the united_nations ? 
if the un troops be not mercenaries then the hessians be not mercenaries either . 
and if the foreigners fight in the katanga_army be mercenaries then lafayette and von_steuben be mercenaries too , as be also the members of the lafayette_escadrille in the early part of world_war 1 , and of chennault 's flying_tigers in the early days of world_war 2 , . 
it does n't take a gore_vidal to tell you what 's wrong with cherokee_textile 's slogan [ `` pitney-bowes objects '' , july_1 ] . 
it be an eighteenth-century negative , man ! 
suggest the following twenty-first-century amendment : 
by move the term `` republic '' to lower_case , substitute the modern phrase `` move ahead '' for the stodgy `` keep '' , and by use the postmaster 's name on every envelope ( in caps , of_course , with the `` in spite '' as faded as possible ) , the slogan cannot fail . 
in the issue of march 5 , 1960 you have an excellent editorial which say : 
`` on trial in jakarta for having fly for the indonesian anti-communist insurgents , u._s. pilot alan_lawrence_pope boldly tell the court that in support the freedom fighters , he was actually defend the sovereignty and independence of indonesia . 
face a prosecution which has demand the death_penalty , he say : ' i have participate in the war against communism in korea and at dienbienphu , and i have help in the evacuation of north vietnamese to the free_world . 
i have do all this for the freedom of the individuals concerned and also for the states which have been threaten by communist domination ' . 
at_least in indonesia , khrushchev find an american proud to be at total war with communism '' ! 
since then nothing has happen to save the life of pope . 
i find recently a very small article in the new_york times : 
`` u._s. flier lose plea . 
indonesia_court uphold pope 's death sentence . 
- indonesia_military supreme_court has confirm the death sentence pass on alan_lawrence_pope , an american pilot . 
pope was convict last year of having aid north celebes rebels by fly bombing missions . 
he has be in prison since may , 1958 , when his aircraft was shoot_down over moluccas . 
he may appeal_to president_sukarno for clemency '' . 
as we see , pope may appeal_to president_sukarno , khrushchev 's friend , for clemency . 
this possibility be anything but reassuring . 
the eleanor_roosevelt tractor_committee act on behalf of the cuban freedom fighters . 
but who will act now and immediately to save the life of alan_pope ? 
be tractors available for him ? 
does anybody think_of save the life of an anti-communist american pilot ? 
a_few days before i see your mention of_what texas liberals were do to promote `` louis_capet '' [ `` the week '' , june 3 ] , another analogy had occur to me . 
consider this table : 
louis 14 , - fdr . 
`` with no strong men and no parliament to dispute his will , he be the government '' . 
regency - truman . 
`` a ' dust-settling ' period of decadence and decline '' . 
louis 15 , - eisenhower . 
`` he open his mouth , say little , and think not_at_all '' . 
louis 16 , - kennedy . 
`` not completely virtuous , but completely incompetent '' . 
and marie_antoinette - jacqueline_bouvier . 
`` the beautiful and light-hearted '' . 
french_revolution - conservative_revolution ? 
truly , that liberals should choose louis 14 , as a bogey-symbol of conservatism be grotesquely ironic , consider the louis 14 , character of their grand monarque , fdr : not_only in his accretion of absolute power and personal deification , ( le roi gouverne par lui meme ) , but in the disastrous effects of his spending and war policies . 
in defeat `` louis_capet '' , john_tower 's victory in texas signal , once_again , the end of the divine right of liberalism . 
it seem to me that n._c. , in his editorial `` confrontation '' [ sr , mar. 25 ] , has hit upon the real problem that bother all_of us in a complex world : how do we retain our personal relationship with those who suffer ? 
this affect us all intimately , and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress . 
i know of no other solution than the one n._c. propose - to do what we can for each sufferer as he confront us , hope that this will spread beyond him to others at_some_time and some place . 
never have i see this express so clearly and so sympathetically . 
thank_you for the illustrated editorial `` confrontation '' . 
it be both great writing and profound religion . 
n._c. has say something important so well that this preacher will many_times be tempt to quote the whole piece . 
i feel that n._c. hit the very core of our existence in the editorial `` confrontation '' . 
personally , it mean a great_deal ; my only hope be that it will be share by many , many others . 
`` confrontation '' should fortify us all , whether in southeast_asia or the u._s. . 
congratulations to n._c. for successfully delve into the heart of the problems that face the peace_corps . 
i concur that it be necessary for americans to have a confrontation of the situation exist in foreign lands . 
it would be heartbreaking to see idealism , and hence effective leadership , thwart by the poverty and hardship which young americans will run_into . 
the editorial `` confrontation '' be certainly direct in its appear to those of us live here in america . 
i personally gain strength from_it . 
thanks for continue to capture the attention and uncover so many areas of need in_this amazing world . 
n. c . 's editorial `` confrontation '' be a stunning piece of writing . 
i would hope that sargent_shriver will encourage everyone enter the peace_corps to read it . 
the important people to humanity be not the khrushchevs and the castros - but the schweitzers and the dooleys , and the others like them whose names we will never know . 
editor 's note : reprints of `` confrontation '' will be include among the material_to be distribute to members of the peace_corps . 
a peace_corps official describe the editorial as `` precisely the message we need_to communicate to the men and women who will soon be peace_corps volunteers '' . 
f._l._lucas 's article in sr 's april 1 issue seem to be a very fair and objective analysis of the new_english_bible . 
i certainly hope this will be the impression leave in the minds of readers , rather_than the comment by cleveland_amory in his first of the month column . 
it be blind , fundamentalist dogmatism to say , `` mess_around with the king_james_version seem to us a perilous sport at_best '' . 
lester_markel be on_the_right track in his article `` interpretation of interpretation '' [ sr , mar. 11 ] . 
the current stereotype of straight news reporting be probably invaluable in protect the press and its readers from pollution by that combination of doctored fact , fancy , and personal opinion called yellow_journalism which flourish in_this country more_than a generation ago . 
we do n't need this type of protection any_more . 
the public is now arm with sophistication and numerous competing media . 
besides , there be no_longer enough corruptible journalists about . 
the accepted method of write news have two major liabilities . 
first , it does not communicate . 
a reporter restrict to the competing propaganda statements of both sides in a major labor dispute , for_instance , be unable to tell his readers half of_what he know about the causes of the dispute . 
second , it subject the news to distortion by the unscrupulous . 
the charges by the late junior senator from wisconsin not_only destroy innocent people but mislead the nation . 
yet the press be powerless to put these charges in perspective in its news columns . 
despite several years of front-page stories , the average citizen be unable to get a complete picture of mccarthy until he see on the television screen what the reporters had been see all_along but have no effective way of communicate . 
the senator had box_in them in with their own restrictions . 
it seem to me the time has come for the american press to start experiment with ways of report the news that will do a better job of communicating and will be less subject_to abuse by those who have learn how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve their own ends . 
the objective should be to provide a method of get into print a higher percentage than be now possible of the relevant information in the possession of reporters and editors . 
i would like to see you devote some space in an early issue to the news blackout concern president_kennedy 's activities , so_far as southern_california be concerned . 
you have on more_than one occasion praise the idea of a televised press_conference and the chance it give the people to form intelligent opinions . 
to_begin_with , the all-powerful los_angeles times does not publish a transcript of these press_conferences . 
i be sure that they did when eisenhower be president . 
next , because of the time differential , the conferences come_on the networks during the middle of the day . 
up until_now , the networks have grudgingly run half-hour tapes at 5 p._m. or sometimes 7 or 10 : 30 p._m. . 
even then , a_few of the `` less interesting '' questions are edit_out and glibly summarize by a commentator . 
however , last night the tapes were not run at_all during the evening hours and all we get on tv be a_few snatches which douglas_edwards and huntley and brinkley could squeeze into their programs . 
this be no criticism of them , as they obviously cannot get a half-hour program into a fifteen-minute news summary . 
the radio_stations did run `` transcripts '' ( i think ) during the evening hours . 
however , by compare the tv snatches , two different radio_station re-runs , and the censored los_angeles times version , i find that the radio_stations had edit_out questions ( abc remove the one regard laos ) or even a paragraph out of the middle of the president 's answer . 
i be interested to know he is get mail from all_over the country about the `` abuse '' he is being subject to . 
we out here do n't see enough of the conference to know he is being abuse . 
i do n't know if this be the situation in other parts of the country ; apparently it be not . 
it also happen with the inauguration , which was not rerun at_all during the evening hours , and i write to the tv editor of the times . 
he did mention in his column the fact that he had receive many letters about this and he himself did not understand the networks and the independent local stations ' not do this - but nothing happen . 
can you bring the networks ' attention to this ? 
i be interested in james_webb_young 's madison avenue column in_which he raise the question `` do we need a college of propaganda '' ? 
[ sr , feb. 11 ] . 
in my estimation , we definitely do ; and the sad part of_it be that we have one , which was round into excellent shape , and we let it disintegrate and die . 
during the war , we set_up schools for the teaching of psychological_warfare , which include the teaching of propaganda , both black_and_white and the various shades of grey in_between . 
we have a_couple_of schools in_this country , the principal one be on the marshall_field estate out in lloyd 's neck . 
there be also a couple in canada , and several in england . 
the_english schools precede ours , and by the time we get_into it they had learn a_lot about the techniques of propaganda and its teaching . 
four of us here in the united_states attend , first as students , then as instructors , almost every one of these schools , in england , canada , and the united_states . 
we set_up the lloyd 's neck school , work_out its curriculum , and teach there . 
toward the end of the war , we really feel that we had learn something about propaganda and_how to teach it . 
when the end did come , and the schools were disband and abandon , we feel and hope that the machinery of psychological_warfare would not be allow to rust . 
we hope that its practitioners and teachers might be put on some sort_of reserve list and call_back for refresher_courses each_year or_so . 
alas , no such thing happen . 
there apparently is no school of propaganda or psychological_warfare . 
a study at the pentagon and at the service academies reveal that nothing was being do there . 
and not_one of the four men who attend all the schools has ever been call_on to apply any of his knowledge in_any_way . 
congratulations on the article `` do we need a college of propaganda '' ? 
this be one of the_most constructive suggestions make in_this critical field in years , and i certainly hope it spark some action . 
many_of us in_public relations were flatter that richard_l._tobin choose to devote his editorial in the march 11 communications supplement to the merger of the public_relations society of america and the american public_relations association . 
i be surprised and sorry to find in your issue of march 4 a long and detailed attack upon a book that had not_yet been publish . 
whether in his forthcoming book c._p._snow commit the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily autobiographical critic charge him be important . 
one should be able_to get_hold_of the book at_once . 
but the attack was make from an advance copy . 
if this practice should take_root and spread , the man who submit a manuscript to a publisher will find himself review before he is accept and publication will become a sort_of post-mortem formality . 
editor 's note : sir_robert_watson-watt write , on page 50 of sr / research for 4 march 1961 : `` i have read an advance copy of the snow book which is to be title , ' science and government ' . 
until the work actually appear i be not privileged to analyze it publicly in_detail . 
but i have compare its text with already published commentaries on the 1960 series of godkin lectures at harvard , from which the book was derive , and i can with_confidence challenge the gist of c._p._snow 's incautious tale '' . 
watson-watt 's remarks in sr did not then , constitute a review of the book but a rebuttal to the godkin lectures . 
representatives of harvard_university press , which is publish the book this month of april , recognize and freely acknowledge that they invite such reaction by allow life magazine to print an excerpt from the book in_advance of the book 's publication date . 
the text of the book leave a somewhat milder impression than the prepublication excerpt . 
sir_robert_watson-watt 's `` rebuttal '' of sir_charles_snow 's godkin lectures is mar throughout by too forceful a desire to defend lindemann and apparently himself from sir_charles ' supposed falsehoods while state those `` falsehoods '' in an unclear incoherent argument . 
the article present the reader with an absurdity at its beginning . 
it call the conclusion admit valid by `` historians and military strategists alike '' a `` perverted conclusion & & & nonsense '' . 
it submit an enthusiastic , impressionistic conception of lindemann contribute another aspect of the man , but on no_more authoritative basis than sir_charles ' account . 
we are leave to choose between the two lindemanns . 
the only fact that hold any weight in the article be the result of the tea_party . 
but we be to believe that lindemann actively support radar outside the tizard_committee , and dissemble , discount it inside ? 
if so , i would lean to sir_charles ' conception of the man . 
i think it be a grave error to print the article at this time . 
to the unfortunate people unable to attend the godkin lectures it cast an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the book which may dissuade some people from read it . 
francois d ' albert , hungarian-born violinist who made his new_york debut three years ago , play a return engagement last night in judson_hall . 
he be now president of the chicago_conservatory_college . 
his pianist be donald_jenni , a faculty_member at depaul_university . 
the acoustics of the small hall had been misgauge by the artists , so_that for the first_half of the program , when the piano be partially open , mr._jenni 's playing be too loud . 
in vie with him , mr. d ' albert also seem to be overdrive his tone . 
this be not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the performances , however , except in the case of the opening work , mozart 's sonata in a ( k. 526 ) , which clatter along noisily in an unrelieved fashion . 
brahm 's sonata in a , although also vigorous , stand_up well under the two artists ' strong , large-scale treatment . 
mr. d ' albert have a firm , attractive tone , which eschew an overly sweet vibrato . 
he make the most of the long brahmsian phrases , and by the directness and drive of his playing give the work a handsome performance . 
a sonata for violin and piano , called `` bella_bella '' , by robert_fleming , was give its first united_states performance . 
the title refer to the nickname give his wife by the composer , who be also a member of the national_film_board of canada . 
the work 's two movements , one melodically sentimental , the other brightly capricious , be clever enough in a ravel-like style , but they rehash a wornout idiom . 
they might well indicate conjugal felicity , but in musical terms that smack of hollywood . 
works by dohnanyi , hubay , mr. d ' albert himself and paganini , indicate that the violinist have some virtuoso fireworks up his sleeve as_well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase . 
standard items by sarasate and saint-saens complete the program . 
in recent years anna_xydis has play with the new_york philharmonic and at lewisohn_stadium , but her program last night at town_hall be the greek-born pianist 's first new_york recital since 1948 . 
miss_xydis have a natural affinity for the keyboard , and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gain the authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control . 
and the tone she command be always beautiful in sound . 
since she also have considerable technical virtuosity and a feeling for music in the romantic tradition , miss_xydis give her listeners a good_deal of pleasure . 
she play with style and a touch of the grand manner , and every piece she perform be especially effective in its closing measures . 
the second_half of her program be devoted_to russian composers of_this century . 
it be in them that miss_xydis be at her best . 
the rachmaninoff_prelude no .12 , op. 32 , for_instance , give her an opportunity to exploit one of her special facilities - the ability to produce fine deep-sounding bass tones while contrast them simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the treble . 
the four kabalevsky preludes be also assured , rich_in color and songful . 
and the prokofieff_seventh_sonata have the combination of romanticism and modern bravura that prokofieff need . 
miss_xydis ' earlier selections be mendelssohn 's variations serieuses , in_which each variation be nicely set_off from the others ; haydn 's sonata in e minor , which be unfailingly pleasant in sound , and chopin 's sonata in b flat minor . 
a memory lapse in the last somewhat mar the pianist 's performance . 
so what be the deepest music on her program have the poorest showing . 
miss_xydis be best when she did not need to be too probing . 
all the generals who hold important commands in world_war 2 , did not write books . 
it only seem as if they did . 
and the best books by generals be not necessarily the first ones write . 
one of the very best is only now publish in_this country , five years after its first publication in england . 
it be `` defeat into victory '' , by field_marshal viscount_slim . 
a long book heavily weighted with military technicalities , in_this edition it be neither so_long nor so technical as it be originally . 
field_marshal slim has abridge it for the benefit of `` those who , find not so great an attraction in accounts of military moves and counter-moves , be more interested in men and their reactions to stress , hardship and danger '' . 
the man whose reactions and conclusions get the_most space be , of_course , the field_marshal himself . 
william_joseph_slim , first_viscount_slim , former governor_general of australia , be the principal british commander in the field during the burma_war . 
he had be a corps commander during the disastrous defeat and retreat of 1942 when the ill-prepared , ill-equipped british forces `` were outmaneuver , outfight and outgeneral '' . 
he return in command of an international army of gurkhas , indians , africans , chinese and british . 
and in_a_series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles and hills and along the great rivers of burma he wage one of the_most brilliant campaigns of the war . 
`` the forgotten_war '' his soldiers call the burma fighting because the war in africa and europe enjoy priorities in equipment and in headlines . 
parts of `` defeat into victory '' be a tangle of burmese place_names and military_units , but a_little application make everything clear enough . 
on_the_whole this be an interesting and exceptionally well-written book . 
field_marshal slim be striking in description , amusing in many anecdotes . 
he have a pleasant sense_of_humor and be modest enough to admit mistakes and even `` a cardinal error '' . 
he praise many individuals generously . 
he himself seem to be tough , tireless , able and intelligent , more intellectual and self-critical than most soldiers . 
`` defeat into victory '' be a dramatic and lively military narrative . 
but it be most interesting in its account of the unending problems of high_command , of decisions and their reasons , of the myriad matters that demand attention in_addition to battle action . 
before he could return to burma , field_marshal slim have to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite them with fresh recruits . 
his remarks about training , discipline , morale , leadership and command be enlightening . 
he believe_in make inspiring speeches and he make a great many . 
he believe_in being see near the front_lines and he be there . 
for general morale reasons and to encourage the efforts of his supply_officers , when food be short for combat troops he cut the rations of his headquarters_staff accordingly . 
other crucial matters require constant supervision : 
labor and all noncombatant troops , whose morale be vital , too ; administrative organization and delicate diplomatic relations with top brass - british , american and chinese ; health , hygiene , medical_aid and preventive_medicine ; hospitals ( inadequate ) and nurses ( scanty ) ; food and military supplies ; logistics and transport ; airdrops and airstrips ; roads and river barges to be build . 
comment on these and other matters , field_marshal slim make many frank and provocative remarks : 
`` when in doubt as to two courses of action , a general should choose the bolder '' . 
`` the commander has fail in his duty if he has not win victory - for that be his duty '' . 
`` it only does harm to talk to troops about new and desirable equipment which others may have but which you cannot give them . 
it depress them . 
so i made no mention of air transport until we could get at least some of_it '' . 
field_marshal slim be more impressed by the courage of japanese soldiers than he be by the ability of their commanders . 
of the japanese private he say : `` he fight and march till he die . 
if 500 japanese were order to hold a position , we have to kill 495 before it be ours - and_then the last five kill themselves '' . 
brood about future wars , the field_marshal have this to say : `` the asian fighting man be at_least equally brave [ as the white ] , usually more careless_of death , less encumbered by mental doubts , less troubled by humanitarian sentiment , and not so moved by slaughter and mutilation around him . 
he be , by background and living standards , better fitted to endure hardship uncomplainingly , to demand less in the way of subsistence or comfort , and to look_after himself when throw on_his_own resources '' . 
a bunch of young buckaroos from out west , who go_by the name of texas boys choir , lope into town_hall last night and succeed in corral the hearts of a sizable audience . 
actually , the program they sing be at_least two-thirds serious and high-minded , and they sing it beautifully . 
under the capable direction of the choir 's founder , geroge_bragg , the twenty-six boys make some lovely sounds in an opening group of renaissance and baroque madrigals and motets , excerpts from pergolesi 's `` stabat_mater '' and all_of the britten `` ceremonial of carols '' . 
their singing be well-balanced , clear and , within obvious limitations , extremely pleasing . 
the limitations be those one expect from untrained and unsettled voices - an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity , an occasional waver and now_and_then a bleat . 
but mr._bragg be a remarkably gifted conductor , and the results he has produce with his boys be generally superior . 
most surprising of all , he has accomplish some prodigies in training for the production of words . 
the latin , for_example , be not_only clear ; it be even beautiful . 
furthermore , there be solid musical virtues in the interpretation of the music . 
lines come_out neatly and in good balance . 
tempos be lively . 
the piano accompaniments by istvan_szelenyi be stylish . 
a boy soprano named dixon_boyd sing a durante solo motet and a_few other passages enchantingly . 
other capable soloists include david_clifton , joseph_schockler and pat_thompson . 
the final group include folk_songs from back home , stomp out , shout and chant with irresistible spirit and in cowboy costume . 
boys will be boys , and texans will be texans . 
the combination prove quite irresistible last night . 
the polish song_and_dance company called mazowsze , after the region of poland , where it have its headquarters , open a three-week engagement at the city_center last night . 
a thoroughly ingratiating company it be , and when the final curtain fall you may suddenly realize that you have been sit with a broad grin on your face all evening . 
not that it be all funny , by_any_means , though some of_it be definitely so , but simply that the dancers be young and handsome , high-spirited and communicative , and the program itself be as vivacious as_it be varied . 
there be no use at_all in try to follow it dance by dance and title by title , for it have a kind_of nonstop format , and move along in an admirable continuity that demand no pauses for identification . 
the material be all basically of folk origin , glean from every section of poland . 
but under the direction of mira_ziminska-sygietynska , who with her late husband found the organization in 1948 , it has all been put into theatrical form , treat selectively , choreograph specifically for presentation to spectators , and perform altogether professionally . 
under the surface of the wide range of folk movements be apparent a sound technical ballet training , and an equally professional sense of performing . 
since the organization was create thirteen years ago , it be obvious that this be not the original company ; it be more likely the sons and daughters of_that company . 
the girls be charming children and the men be wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters . 
the stage be constantly full_of them ; indeed , there be never fewer than eight of them on stage , and that be only for the more intimate numbers . 
they can be exuberant or sentimental , flirtatious or funny , but the only thing they seem unable to be be dull . 
to pick_out particular numbers be something of a problem , but one or two identifiable items be too conspicuously excellent to be miss . 
there be for_example , a stunning krakowiak that close the first act ; the mazurka choreograph by witold_zapala to music from moniuszko 's opera , `` strasny_dwor ' , may be the_most beautiful mazurka you be likely ever to see ; there be an enchanting polonaise ; and the dances and songs from the tatras contain a magnificent dance for the men . 
everywhere there be little touches of humor , and the leader of the on-stage band of musicians be an ebullient comedian who play all sorts of odd instruments with winning warmth . 
the superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of william_james be never more evident than in his letters . 
here be a man with an enormous gift for living as_well as thinking . 
to both persons and ideas he bring the same delighted interest , the same open-minded relish for what be unique in each , the same discriminating sensibility and quicksilver intelligence , the same gallantry of judgment . 
for this latest addition to the great letters series , under the general editorship of louis_kronenberger , miss_hardwick has make a selection which admirably display the variety of james 's genius , not_to_mention the felicities of his style . 
and_how he could write ! 
his famous criticism of brother henry 's `` third style '' be surely as subtly , even elegantly , worded an analysis of the latter 's intricate air_castles as henry himself could ever have produce . 
his letter to his daughter on the pains of growing_up be surely as trenchant , forthright , and warmly understanding a_piece of advice as ever a grown-up pen to a sensitive child , and with just the right tone of unpatronizing good_humor . 
most_of_all , his letters to his philosophic colleagues show a magnanimity as_well as an honesty which help to explain whitehead 's reference_to james as `` that adorable genius '' . 
miss_hardwick speak of his `` superb gift for intellectual friendship '' , and it be certainly a joy to see the intellectual life live so free from either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism . 
this be a virtue of_which we have great need in a society where there seem to be an increasing lack of communication - or even desire for communication - between differing schools_of_thought . 
it hold an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word `` intellectual '' has become a term of opprobrium to millions of well-meaning people who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human virtues . 
to his harvard colleague , josiah_royce , whose philosophic position differ radically from his own , james could write , `` different as our minds be , yours has nourish mine , as no other social influence ever has , and in converse with you i have always feel that my life was being live importantly '' . 
of another colleague , george_santayana , he could write : `` the great event in my life recently has be the reading of santayana 's book . 
although i absolutely reject the platonism of_it , i have literally squeal with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the position is lay_down on page after page '' . 
write to his colleague george_herbert_palmer - `` glorious old palmer '' , as he address him - james say that if only the students at harvard could really understand royce , santayana , palmer , and himself and see that their varying systems be `` so many religions , ways of front life , and worth fight for '' , then harvard would have a genuine philosophic universe . 
`` the best condition of_it would be an open conflict and rivalry of the diverse systems . 
the world might ring with the struggle , if we devote ourselves exclusively to belabor each other '' . 
the `` belaboring '' be of_course jocular , yet james be not lacking in fundamental seriousness - unless we measure him by that ultimate seriousness of the great religious_leader or thinker who stake all on his vision of god . 
to james this vision never quite come , despite his appreciation of_it in others . 
but there be a dignity and even a hint of the inspired prophet in his words to one correspondent : `` you ask what i am going_to ' reply ' to bradley . 
but why need one reply to everything and everybody ? 
i think that readers generally hate minute polemics and recriminations . 
all polemic of ours should , i believe , be either very broad statements of contrast , or fine points treat singly , and as_far_as_possible impersonally . 
as far as the rising generation goes , why not simply express ourselves positively , and trust that the truer view quietly will displace the other . 
here again ' god will know his own '' ' . 
the collected works of james_thurber , now number 25 volumes ( include the present exhibit ) represent a high standard of literary excellence , as every schoolboy know . 
the primitive-eclogue quality of his drawings , akin to_that of graffiti scratch on a cave wall , be equally well_known . 
about all that remain to be say be that the present selection , most_of which appear first in the new_yorker , comprise ( as_usual ) a slightly unstrung necklace , hold together by little more_than a slender thread cunningly insert in the spine of the book . 
the one unifying note , if any , is sound in the initial article entitled : `` how to get_through the day '' . 
it is repeat at intervals in some rather sadly desperate word-games for insomniacs , the hospitalized , and_others force to rely_on inner_resources , include ( in the p 's alone ) `` palindromes '' , `` paraphrases '' , and `` parodies '' . 
`` the tyranny of trivia '' suggest arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber . 
and new vistas of hairshirt asceticism are open by scholarly monographs entitled : 
`` friends , romans , countrymen , lend me your ear-muffs '' , `` such a phrase as drift through dream '' , and `` the new_vocabularianism '' . 
some of thurber 's curative methods involve strong potions of mixed metaphor , malapropism , and gobbledygook and are recommend for use only in extreme cases . 
a burlesque paean entitled : `` hark the herald_tribune , times , and all the other angels sing '' brilliantly succeed in exaggerate even motion-picture ballyhooey . 
`` how_the_kooks_crumble '' feature an amusingly accurate take-off on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radio - tv commercials , and `` the watchers of the night '' be a veritable waking nightmare . 
a semi-serious literary document entitled `` the wings of henry_james '' be noteworthy , if only for a keenly trenchant though little-known comment on the master 's difficult later period by modest owen_wister , author of `` the virginian '' . 
james , he remark in a letter to a friend , `` is attempt the impossible , namely , to produce upon the reader , as a painting produce upon the gazer , a_number_of superimposed , simultaneous impressions . 
he would like to put several sentences on top of each other so_that you could read them all_at_once , and get all_at_once , the various shadings and complexities '' . 
equally penetrating in its fashion be the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation : 
`` so_much has already been write about everything that you can n't find_out anything about it '' . 
or the mildly epigrammatic utterance ( also a quotation ) : `` woman 's place be in the wrong '' . 
who but thurber can be count_on to glean such nectareous essences ? 
a tribute to midsummer `` bang-sashes '' seem terribly funny , though it would be hard to explain why . 
`` one of them bang the sash of the window nearest my bed around midnight in july and i leap out of sleep and out_of_bed . 
' it be just a bat ' say my wife reassuringly , and i sigh with relief . 
' thank god for that ' i say ; ' i think it be a human_being '' ' . 
in_a_sense , perhaps , thurber be indebted artistically to the surrealist painter ( be it salvador_dali ? ) 
who first conceive the startling fancy of a picture_window in the abdomen . 
that_is , it be literally a picture_window : you do n't see into the viscera ; you see a picture - trees , or flowers . 
this be something like what thurber 's best effects be like , if i be not mistaken . 
though no_longer able to turn_out his protoplasmic pen-and-ink sketches ( several old favorites be scattered through the present volume ) thurber has retain unimpaired his vision of humor as a thing of simple , unaffected humanness . 
in his concluding paragraph he write : `` the devoted writer of humor will continue to try to come as close_to truth as he can '' . 
for many readers thurber come closer than anyone else in_sight . 
the latest low be a puzzler . 
the master 's hand has lose none of its craft . 
he be at his usual best in expose the shams and self-deceptions of political and diplomatic life in the fifties . 
the reader meet a_few old friends like blimp and the tuc horse , and become better acquainted_with new members of the cast_of_characters like the bomb itself , and civilization in her classic robe watch the nuclear arms_race , her hair stand straight out . 
but there be a difference between the present volume and the early low . 
there be fear in the fifties as his title suggest and as his competent drawings show . 
but there be terror in the thirties when the nazis be on_the_loose and in those days low strike like lightning . 
anyone can draw his own conclusions from this difference . 
it might be argue that the communists be less inhuman than the nazis and furnish the artist with drama in a lower key . 
but this argument cannot be push very far because the communist system make_up for any shortcomings of its leaders in respect_to corrosion . 
the communists wield a power unknown to hitler . 
and the leading issue , that of piecemeal aggression , remain the same . 
this be drama enough . 
do we ourselves offer mr._low less of a crusade ? 
in the thirties we would not face our enemy ; that be a nightmarish situation and low be in his element . 
now we have stand_up to the communists ; we be stronger and more self-confident - and low cannot so easily put us to rights . 
or does the reason for less jovian drawings lie elsewhere ? 
it might be that low has see too many stupidities and that they do not outrage him now . 
he write , `` confucius hold that in times of stress one should take short views - only up_to lunchtime '' . 
whatever the cause , his mood in the fifties rarely rise above the level of the capably sardonic . 
dulles ? 
he does not seem to have catch the subtleties of the man . 
mccarthy ? 
the skies turn dark but the clouds do not loose their wrath . 
suez ? 
low seem to have support eden at_first and_then relent because things work_out differently , so there be no fire in his eye . 
stalin 's death , churchill 's farewell to public life , hillary and tensing on everest , quemoy and matsu - all subjects for a noble anger or an accolade . 
instead the cartoons seem to deal with foibles . 
their eisenhower be insubstantial . 
did low decide to let well enough alone when he make his selections ? 
he often draw the bomb . 
he show puny men attack by splendidly tyrannical machines . 
and khrushchev turn_out to be prime copy for the_most witty caricaturist of them all . 
but , but and but . 
look in_this book for weak mortals and only on_occasion for virtues and vices on the heroic scale . 
read the moderately brief text , not for captions , sometimes for tart epigrams , once_in_a_while for an explosion in_the_middle of your fixed ideas . 
a gray_fox with a patch on one eye - confidence_man , city_slicker , lebensraum specialist - try to take_over catfish_bend in_this third relaxed allegory from mr._burman 's refreshing louisiana animal community . 
the fox be all ingratiating smiles when he arrive from new_orleans , accompany by one wharf_rat . 
but like all despots , as he build his following from among the gullible , he grow more threatening toward those who won n't follow - such solid citizens as doc_raccoon ; judge_black , the vegetarian black snake ; and the eagle , who lead the_bird community when he be not too busy in washington pose for fifty-cent_pieces . 
as soon as the fox has take_hold on most_of the populace he import more wharf_rats , who , of_course , say they be the aggrieved victims of an extermination campaign in the city . 
( the followers of bullies invariably be aggrieved about the very things they plan to do to others . ) 
they train the mink and other animals to fight . 
and pretty soon gray_fox is announce that he won n't have anyone around that be against him , and set_out to break his second territorial treaty with the_birds . 
robert_hillyer , the poet , write in his introduction to this brief animal fable that mr._burman ought_to win a nobel_prize for the catfish_bend series . 
he may have a point in urge that decadent themes be give fewer prizes . 
but it be hard to imagine mr._burman as a nobel_laureate on the basis of these charming but not really momentous fables . 
in substance they lie somewhere between the southern dialect animal stories of joel_chandler_harris ( uncle_remus ) and the polished , witty fables of james_thurber . 
george_kennan 's account of relations between russia and the west from the fall of tsarism to the end of world_war 2 , be the finest piece of diplomatic history that has appear in many years . 
it combine qualities that are seldom find in one work : scrupulous scholarship , a fund of personal experience , a sense of drama and characterization and a broad grasp of the era 's great historical issues . 
in_short , the book , base largely on lectures deliver at harvard_university , be both reliable and readable ; the author possess an uncommonly fine english style , and he is deal with subjects of vast importance that be highly topical for our time . 
if mr._kennan be sometimes a_little somber in his appraisals , if his analysis of how western diplomacy meet the challenge of an era of great_wars and social revolutions be often critical and pessimistic - well , the record itself be not too encouraging . 
mr._kennan take careful account of every mitigating circumstance in recall the historical atmosphere in_which mistaken decisions were taken . 
but he reject , perhaps a_little too sweepingly , the theory that disloyal and pro-communist influences may have contribute to the policy of appease stalin which persist until after the end of the war and reach its high point at the yalta_conference in february , 1945 . 
after_all , alger_hiss , subsequently convict of perjury in deny that he give secret state_department documents to soviet agents , be at yalta . 
and harry_dexter_white , implicated in f._b._i. reports in communist associations , be one of the architects of the morgenthau_plan , which had it ever been put into full operation , would have simply hand germany to stalin . 
one item in_this unhappy scheme be to have germany police exclusively by its continental neighbors , among whom only the soviet_union possess real military strength . 
it be quite probable , however , that stupidity , inexperience and childish adherence to slogans like `` unconditional surrender '' have more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than treason or sympathy with communism . 
mr._kennan sum_up his judgment of_what go_wrong this way . 
`` you see , first_of_all and in_a_sense as the source of all other ills , the unshakeable american commitment to the principle of unconditional surrender : the tendency to view any war in_which we might be involved not as a means of achieve limited objectives in the way of changes in a given status_quo , but as a struggle to the death between total virtue and total evil , with the result that the war had absolutely to be fight to the complete destruction of the enemy 's power , no_matter what disadvantages or complications this might involve for the more distant future '' . 
recognize that there could have be no effective negotiated peace with hitler , he point_out the shocking failure to give support to the anti-nazi underground , which very_nearly eliminate hitler in 1944 . 
a veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge of russian language , history and literature , kennan recall how , at_the_time of hitler 's attack on the soviet_union in 1941 , he pen a private note to a state_department official , express the hope that `` never would we associate ourselves with russian purposes in the areas of eastern europe beyond her own boundaries '' . 
the hope be vain . 
with justified bitterness the author speak of `` what seem to me to have be an inexcusable body of ignorance about the nature of the russian_communist movement , about the history of its diplomacy , about what had happen in the purges , and about what had been go_on in poland and the baltic_states '' . 
he also speak of franklin_d._roosevelt 's `` puerile '' assumption that `` if only he ( stalin ) could be expose to the persuasive charm of someone like f._d._r. himself , ideological preconceptions would melt and russia 's co-operation with the west could be easily arrange '' . 
no wonder khrushchev 's first message to president_kennedy be a wistful desire for the return of the `` good old days '' of roosevelt . 
this fascinating story begin with a sketch , rich_in personal detail , of the glancing mutual impact of world_war 1 , and the two instalments of the russian_revolution . 
the first of these involve the replacement of the tsar by a liberal provisional_government in march , 1917 ; the second , the seizure of power by the bolsheviks ( who later call themselves communists ) in november of the same year . 
as kennan show , the judgment of the allied governments about what was happen in russia was warp by the obsession of defeat germany . 
they be blind_to the evidence that nothing could keep the russian people fight . 
they attribute everything that go_wrong in russia to german influence and intrigue . 
this , more_than any other factor , lead to the fiasco of allied intervention . 
as the author very justly say : 
`` had a world_war not be in_progress , there would never , under any conceivable stretch of the imagination , have be an allied intervention in north_russia '' . 
the scope and significance of_this intervention have been grossly exaggerate by communist propaganda ; here kennan , operate with precise facts and figures , perform an excellent job of debunking . 
of many passages in the book that exemplify the author 's vivid style , the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may be select . 
on stalin : 
`` this be a man of incredible criminality , of a criminality effectively without limits ; a man apparently foreign to the very experience of love , without mercy or pity ; a man in whose entourage none be ever safe ; a man whose hand was set against all that could not be useful to him at the moment ; a man who be most dangerous of all to those who be his closest collaborators in crime '' . 
and here be kennan 's image of hitler , stalin 's temporary collaborator in the subjugation and oppression of weaker peoples , and his later enemy : 
`` behind that charlie_chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always covered his forehead , behind the tirades and the sulky silences , the passionate orations and the occasional dull evasive stare , behind the prejudices , the cynicism , the total amorality of behavior , behind even the tendency to great strategic mistakes , there lie a statesman of no mean qualities : 
shrewd , calculating , in many ways realistic , endowed - like stalin - with considerable powers of dissimulation , capable_of play his cards very close_to his chest when he so desire , yet bold and resolute in his decisions , and possess one gift stalin did not possess : the ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken_word '' . 
two criticisms of_this generally admirable and fascinating book involve the treatment of wartime diplomacy which be jagged at the edges - there be no mention of the potsdam_conference or the morgenthau_plan . 
and in a concluding chapter about america 's stance in the contemporary_world , one sense certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come_to_grips with the baffling riddle of our time : how to deal with a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war . 
but one should not ask for everything . 
mr._kennan , who has recently abandon authorship for a new round of diplomacy as the recently appointed american ambassador to yugoslavia , be not the only man who find it easier to portray the past than to prescribe for the future . 
the story of a quarter of a century of soviet-western relations be vitally important , and it is tell with the fire of a first-rate historical narrator . 
the ireland we usually hear about in the theater be a place of bitter political or domestic unrest , lightened occasionally with flashes of native wit and charm . 
in `` donnybrook '' , there be quite a different eire , a rural land where singing , dancing , fist-fighting and romancing be the thing . 
there be plenty of violence , to_be_sure , but it be a nice violence and no one gets kill . 
by_and_large , robert_mcenroe 's adaptation of maurice_walsh 's film , `` the quiet man '' , provide the entertainment it set_out to , and we have a lively musical show if_not a superlative one . 
this be the tale of one john_enright , an american who has accidentally kill a man in the prize_ring and is now try to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become a quiet man . 
but innesfree , where ellen_roe_danaher and her bullying brother , will , live , be no place for a man who will not use his fists . 
so enright 's court of the mettlesome ellen is impede considerably , thereby provide the tale which is tell . 
you may be sure he marry her in_the_end and has a fine old knockdown fight with the brother , and that there be plenty of minor scraps along the way to ensure that you understand what the word donnybrook mean . 
then there be a matchmaker , one mikeen_flynn , a role for which eddie_foy was happily select . 
now there be no reason in the world why a matchmaker in ireland should happen also to be a talented soft-shoe dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs , torso and neck , except that these talents add immensely to the enjoyment of the play . 
mr._foy be a joy , having learn his dancing by practice it until he be practically perfect . 
his matchmaking be , naturally , incidental , and it only serves flynn right when a determined widow take him by the ear and lead him off to matrimony . 
art_lund , a fine big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice , impersonate enright . 
although he is not grace with the subtleties of romantic technique , that be not what an ex-prize fighter be supposed to have , anyway . 
joan_fagan , a fiery redhead who can impress you that she have a temper whether she really have one or not , play ellen , and sing the role very_well , too . 
if the mettle which ellen exhibit have a_bit of theatrical dross in it , never mind ; she fit into the general scheme well enough . 
susan_johnson , as the widow , spend the first_half of the play run a bar and sing about the unlamented death of her late husband and the second_half try to acquire a new one . 
she have a good , firm delivery of songs and add to the solid virtues of the evening . 
then there be a pair of old biddies play by grace_carney and sibly_bowan who may be right off the shelf of stock irish characters , but they put such a combination of good_will and malevolence into their parts that they be quite entertaining . 
and in the role of will danaher , philip_bosco roar and sneer sufficiently to intimidate not_only one american but the whole british army , if he choose . 
`` donnybrook '' be no `` brigadoon '' , but it does have some very nice romantic background touches and some excellent dancing . 
the ballads be sweet and sad , and the music generally competent . 
it sometimes threaten to linger in the memory after the final curtain , and some of_it , such_as the catchy `` sez i '' , does . 
`` a toast to the bride '' , sing by clarence_nordstrom , play a character called old_man toomey , be quite simple , direct and touching . 
the men of innesfree are get_up authentically in cloth_caps and sweaters , and their dancing and singing be fine . 
so be that of the limber company of lasses who whirl and glide and quickstep under jack_cole 's expert choreographic direction . 
the male dancers sometimes wear kilts and their performance in them be spirited and stimulating . 
rouben_ter-arutunian , in his stage_settings , often use the scrim curtain behind which mr._cole has place couples or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow . 
there be no reason why most theatergoers should not have a pretty good time at `` donnybrook '' , unless they be permanently in the mood of enright when he sing about how easily he could hate the lovable irish . 
we can all breathe more easily this morning - more easily and joyously , too - because joshua_logan has turn the stage show , `` fanny '' , into a delightful and heart-warming film . 
the task of take the raw_material of marcel_pagnol 's original trio of french films about people of the waterfront in marseilles and put them again on the screen , after their passage through the broadway musical idiom , be a delicate and perilous one , indeed . 
more_than the fans of pagnol 's old films and of their heroic star , the great raimu , were look askance at the project . 
the fans of the musical were , too . 
but now the task be completed and the uncertainty resolved with the opening of the english-dialogue picture at the music_hall yesterday . 
whether fan of the pagnol films or stage show , whether partial_to music or no , you can n't help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense_of_humor and a heart . 
some of the new_york philharmonic musicians who live in the suburbs spend yesterday morning dig themselves free from snow . 
a tiny handful never did make the concert . 
but , after a fifteen-minute delay , the substantially complete philharmonic assemble on stage for the afternoon 's proceedings . 
they face a rather small audience , as quite_a_few subscribers apparently had decide to forego the pleasures of the afternoon . 
it be an excellent concert . 
paul_paray , round_out his current stint with the orchestra , be a solid musician , and the philharmonic play for him . 
their collaboration in the beethoven_second_symphony be lucid , intelligent and natural sounding . 
it be not a heavy , ponderous beethoven . 
the music sing nicely , sprint evenly when necessary , be properly accented and balanced . 
the franck symphonic_poem , `` psyche '' , be a lush , sweet-sounding affair that be pleasant to encounter once_again . 
fortunate for the music itself , it be not too frequent a visitor ; if it be , its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying . 
mr._paray resist the temptation to overemphasize the melodic elements of the score . 
he did not let the strings , for_instance , weep , whine or get hysterical . 
his interpretation be a model of refinement and accuracy . 
and in the prokofieff c major piano_concerto , with zadel_skolovsky as soloist , he be an admirable partner . 
mr._skolovsky 's approach to the concerto be bold , sweeping and tonally percussive . 
he sweep_through the music with ease , in a non-sentimental and ultra-efficient manner . 
an impressive technician , mr._skolovsky have fine rhythm , to_boot . 
his tone be the weakest part of his equipment ; it tend to be hard and colorless . 
a school_of_thought have it that those attributes be exactly what this concerto need . 
it be , after_all , a non-romantic work ( even with the big , juicy melody of the second movement ) ; and the composer himself be called the `` age of steel pianist '' . 
but granted all this , one still would have like to have hear a_little more tonal nuance than mr._skolovsky supply . 
take as_a_whole , though , it be a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra . 
mr._skolovsky fully deserve the warm reception he receive . 
a new work on the program be nikolai_lopatnikoff 's `` festival_overture '' , receive its first new_york hearing . 
this was compose last year as a salute to the automobile_industry . 
it be not program music , though . 
it run a_little more_than ten minutes , be workmanlike , busy , methodical and featureless . 
`` la_gioconda '' , like it or not , be a singer 's opera . 
and so , of_course , it be a fan 's opera as_well . 
snow or no , the fans be present in_force at the metropolitan_opera last night for a performance of the ponchielli work . 
so the plot creaks , the sets are decaying , the costumes are pre-historic , the orchestra be sloppy and not_very_well connected with what the singers were do . 
after_all , the opera have juicy music to sing and the goodies be well distributed , with no_less_than six leading parts . 
one of those parts be that of evil , evil barnaba , the spy . 
his wicked deeds were carry_on by anselmo_colzani , who was take the part for_the_first_time with the company . 
he have the temperament and the stage presence for a rousing villain and he sing with character and strong tone . 
what be lacking be a real sense of phrase , the kind_of legato singing that would have add a dimension of smoothness to what be , after_all , a very oily character . 
regina_resnik as laura and cesare_siepi as alvise also be new_to the cast , but only with_respect_to this season ; they have both sing these parts here before . 
laura be a good role for miss_resnik , and she give it force , dramatic color and passion . 
mr._siepi be , as always , a consummate actor ; with a_few telling strokes he characterize alvise magnificently . 
part of_this characterization was , of_course , accomplished with the vocal chords . 
his singing be strong and musical ; unfortunately his voice be out of focus and often spread in quality . 
eileen_farrell in the title_role , mignon_dunn as la_cieca and richard_tucker as enzo be holdovers from earlier performances this season , and all contribute to a vigorous performance . 
if only they and fausto_cleva in the_pit had get_together a_bit more . 
`` melodious birds sing madrigals '' saith the poet and no better description of the madrigal of the deller_consort could be imagine . 
their vanguard album madrigal masterpieces ( bg 609 ; stereo bgs 5031 ) be a good sample of the special , elegant art of english madrigal singing . 
it also make a fine introduction to the international art_form with good_examples of italian and english madrigals plus several french `` chansons '' . 
the_english have manage to hold onto their madrigal tradition better than anyone else . 
the original impulses come to england late ( in the sixteenth century ) and continue strong long after everyone else had go_on to the baroque basso_continuo , sonatas , operas and the_like . 
even after elizabethan traditions were weaken by the cromwellian interregnum , the practice of sing together - choruses , catches and glees - always flourish . 
the_english never_again develop a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier great age the way , say , the opera in italy blot_out the italian madrigal . 
latter-day interest in elizabethan singing date_back well back into the nineteenth century in england , much ahead of similar revivals in other countries . 
as a result no comparable literature of the period be better known and better study nor more_often perform than the_english madrigal . 
naturally , mr._deller and the other singers in his troupe be most charming and elegant when they be squarely in their tradition and sing music by their countrymen : william_byrd , thomas_morley and thomas_tomkins . 
there is an almost instrumental quality to their singing , with a tendency to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture . 
both techniques give the music purity and clarity . 
claude_jannequin 's vocal description of a battle ( the_french equivalents of tarantara , rum-tum-tum , and boom-boom-boom be very picturesque ) be lots_of fun , and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other chansons by jannequin and lassus . 
only with the more sensual , intense and baroque expressions of marenzio , monteverdi and gesualdo does the singing seem a_little superficial . 
nevertheless , the musicality , accuracy and infectious charm of these performances , excellently reproduce , make it an attractive look-see at the period . 
the works are present chronologically . 
texts and translations are provide . 
the elements of elegance and color in jannequin be strong french characteristics . 
baroque instrumental music in italy and germany tend to be strong , lively , intense , controlled and quite abstract . 
in france , it remain always more picturesque , more dancelike , more full_of flavor . 
couperin and rameau give titles to nearly everything they write , not in the later sense of `` program music '' but as a kind_of nonmusical reference for the close , clear musical forms fill with keen wit and precise utterance . 
both composers turn_up on new imports from france . 
bam be the unlikely name of a french recording company whose full label be editions de la boite a musique . 
they specialize in out-of-the-way items and old_french music naturally occupy a good_deal of their attention . 
sonates et concerts royaux of couperin le grand occupy two disks ( ld056 and ld060 ) and reveal the impeccable taste and workmanship of_this master - delicate , flexible and gemlike . 
the concerts - nos. 2 , 6 , 9 , 10 and 14 are represent - be really closer to chamber suites than to concertos in the italian sense . 
the sonatas , `` la_francaise '' , `` la_sultane '' , `` l ' astree '' and `` l ' imperiale '' , are often more elaborately work_out and , in_fact , show a strong italian influence . 
couperin also turn_up along with some lesser-known contemporaries on a disk called musique_francaise_du 18 , e siecle ( bam ld 060 ) . 
jean-marie_leclair still is remembered a_bit , but bodin de beismortier , corrette and mondonville be hardly household words . 
what be interesting about these chamber works here be how they all reveal the aspect of french music that was move toward the rococo . 
the couperin `` la_steinkerque '' , with its battle music , brevity , wit and refined simplicity , already shake_off corelli and point towards the mid-century elegances that end the baroque era . 
if couperin show the fashionable trend , the others do so all the more . 
all these records have close , attractive sound and the performances by a variety of instrumentalists be characteristic . 
rameau 's six concerts en sextuor , record by l ' orchestre de chambre pierre_menet ( bam ld 046 ) , turn_out to be harpsichord pieces arrange for strings apparently by the composer himself . 
the strange , delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes inexplicable titles be still evocative and gracious . 
maitres_allemands_des 17 , e et 18 , e siecles contain music by pachelbel , buxtehude , rosenmueller and telemann , well performed by the ensemble_instrumental_sylvie_spycket ( bam ld 035 ) . 
rococo music - a_lot_of it - was play in carnegie_recital_hall on saturday night in the first of four concerts being sponsor this season by a new organization known_as globe_concert_arts . 
works by j._c._bach , anton craft , joseph_haydn , giuseppe_sammartini , comenico_dragonetti and j._g._janitsch were perform by seven instrumentalists include anabel_brieff , flutist , josef_marx , oboist , and robert_conant , pianist and harpsichordist . 
since rococo music tend to be pretty and elegant above_all , it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grow accustomed_to the stress and dissonances of composers from beethoven to boulez . 
thus there be really an excess of eighteenth-century charm as one of these light-weight pieces follow another on saturday night . 
each might find a useful place in a varied musical program , but take together they grow quite tiresome . 
the performances be variable , those of the full ensemble be generally satisfying , some by soloists proving rather trying . 
ellie_mao , soprano , and frederick_fuller , baritone , present a program of folksongs entitled `` east_meets_west '' in carnegie_recital_hall last night . 
they were accompany by anna_mi_lee , pianist . 
selections from fifteen countries were sing as solos and duets in a broad range of languages . 
songs from china and japan were reserve exclusively for miss_mao , who be a native of china , and those of the_british isles were sing by mr._fuller , who be english by birth . 
this was not a program intend to illustrate authentic folk styles . 
on_the_contrary , miss_mao and mr._fuller choose many_of their arrangements from the works of composers such_as mendelssohn , dvorak , canteloube , copland and britten . 
thre was , therefore , more musical substance in the concert than might have be the case otherwise . 
the performances were assured , communicative and pleasingly informal . 
what was omit from `` a neglected_education '' be those essentials known_as `` the facts of life '' . 
chabrier 's little one-act operetta , present yesterday afternoon at town_hall , be a fragile , precious little piece , very french , not without wit and charm . 
the poor uneducated newlywed , a certain gontran de boismassif , have his problems in get the necessary information . 
the humor of the situation can be imagine . 
it all take_place in the eighteenth century . 
what a silly , artificial way_of_life , chabrier and his librettists chuckle . 
but they wish they could bring it back . 
chabrier 's delightful music stand just at the point where the classical , rationalist tradition , ( hand_down to chabrier largely in the form of operetta and salon music ) become virtually neo-classicism . 
the musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense_of_taste and measure save a wry little joke from become either bawdy or mawkish . 
the simple , clever production be also able to tread the thin line between those extremes . 
arlene_saunders be charming as poor gontran . 
yes , arlene be her name ; the work use the old eighteenth-century tradition of give the part of a young inexperienced youth to a soprano . 
benita_valente be delightful as the young wife and john_parella be amusing as the tutor who fail to do all his tutoring . 
the work was present as the final event in the town_hall festival of music . 
it was pair with a darius_milhaud opera , `` the poor_sailor '' , set_to a libretto by jean_cocteau , a kind_of grand_guignol by the sea , a sailor return , unrecognized , and get do_in by his wife . 
with the exception of a_few spots , milhaud 's music mostly churn away with his usual collection of ditties , odd harmonies , and lumbering , satiric orchestration . 
have a funny experience at newport yesterday afternoon . 
sit there and as a woman sing , she keep get thinner and thinner , right before my eyes , and the eyes of some 5500 other people . 
i make this observation about the lady , miss_judy_garland , because she bring_up the subject herself in tell a story about a british female reporter who flatter her terribly in london recently and_then write in the paper the next day : 
`` judy_garland has arrive in london . 
she be not chubby . 
she be not plump . 
she be fat '' . 
but who care , when the lady sing ? 
certainly not the largest afternoon audience newport has ever have at a jazz concert and the_most attentive and quiet . 
they applaud every number , not_only at its conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme - sometimes at the first chord . 
and judy sing the lovely old familiar things which seem , at_times , a blessed relief from the way-out compositions of the progressive jazzmen who have dominate these proceedings . 
things like `` when_you're_smiling '' , `` almost_like_being_in_love '' , `` do_it_again '' , `` born_to_wander '' , `` alone together '' , `` who_cares ? '' 
, `` puttin ' on the ritz '' , `` how_long_has_this_been_going_on ? '' and her own personal songs like `` the_man_that_got_away '' , and the inevitable `` over the rainbow '' . 
miss_garland be not_only one of the great singers of our time but she be one of the superb showmen . 
at_the_start of her program there be evidences of pique . 
she had hold to the letter of her contract and did n't come onto the stage until well after 4 p. m. , the appointed hour , although the music at newport people had try to get the program underway at 3 . 
then there be a bad delay in get mort_lindsey 's 30 - piece orchestra wedge into its chairs . 
along about 4 : 30 , just when it was get_to be about time to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side , judy come_on sing , in a short-skirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket that flap in the wind . 
her bouffant coiffure was fortunately combed on_the_left which happen to be the direction from which a brisk breeze was blow . 
in her first song she wave away one encroaching photographer who dare approach the throne unbidden and thereafter the boys with the cameras had_to unsheathe their 300 mm. lenses and shoot at extreme range . 
there also come a brief contretemps with the sound mixers who make the mistake of being overhear during a quiet moment near the conclusion of `` do_it_again '' , and she make the tart observation that `` i never see so_much move about in an audience '' . 
but it did n't take judy_garland , showman , long to realize that this sort_of thing be par for the course at newport and that you have_to learn to live with_it . 
before her chore was finish she was rescue wind-blown sheets of music , trundle microphones about the stage , help to move the piano and otherwise join in the informal atmosphere . 
and time after time she really belt_out her songs . 
sometimes they strike me as horribly over-arranged - which be the way i feel about her `` come_rain_or_come_shine '' - and sometimes they be just plain magnificent , like her shatteringly beautiful `` beautiful weather '' . 
to her partisan audience , such picayune haggling would have seem nothing more_than a critic strive to hold his franchise ; they just sit_back on their haunches and cry for more , as though they could never get enough . 
they were reward with splendid , exciting , singing . 
her `` rockabye your baby '' be as_good_as it can be do , and her really personal songs , like `` the_man_that_got_away '' be deeply moving . 
the audience would n't let her leave until it had hear `` over the rainbow '' - although the fellow that keep cry for `` get_happy '' had_to go_home unhappy , about that item anyway . 
she be generous with her encores and the audience be equally so with its cheers and applause and flowers . 
all go_home happy except the newport police , who fear that the throng depart at 6 : 35 might meet head-on the night crowd draw nigh , and those deprived_of their happy_hour at the cocktail bar . 
in newport last night there be flashes of distant lightning in the northern skies . 
this be perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the evening - flashes in the distance , but no storm . 
several_times it came_near break , and there be in_fact some lovely peals of thunder from jerry_mulligan 's big_band , which be about as fine an aggregation as has come_along in the jazz business since john_hammond find count_basie work in a kansas_city trap . 
mulligan 's band has been infect with his solid sense of swing , and what it do seem far more meaningful than most_of the noise generate by the big concert aggregations . 
but what be equally impressive be the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and mulligan 's baritone sax in a fragile ballad like bob_brookmeyer 's arrangement of `` django 's castle '' . 
for subtle swinging rhythms , i could admire intensely mulligan 's version of `` weep '' , and the fireworks go on display in `` 18 carrots for robert '' , a sax tribute to johnny_hodges . 
there be considerable contrast between this mulligan performance and that of art_blakey and the jazz messengers , who be able_to generate a tremendous sound for such a small group . 
unfortunately , blakey does n't choose to work much of the time in_this vein . 
he prefer to have his soloist performing and thus we get only brief glimpses of_what his ensemble work be like . 
what we did get , however , be impressive . 
a_few drops of rain just before midnight , when sarah_vaughan be in_the_midst of her first number , scatter the more timid members of the audience briefly , but at this hour and with sarah on the stand , most_of the listeners did n't care whether they get wet . 
miss_vaughan be back in top form , somehow mellowed and improved with the passage of time - like a fine wine . 
after the spate of female vocalists we have been have , all_of whom take sarah as a point of departure and_then try to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat , it seem that all that has happen be to make the real_thing seem better than ever . 
the evening program was open by the jazz three , a newport group consist_of steve_budieshein on bass , jack_warner , drums , and don_cook , piano . 
this be a continuation of a good idea which be first try_out saturday night when the eddie_stack group , also local talent , go on first . 
put_on local musicians at_this_place in the program serve a triple purpose : it save the top flight jazz men from being waste in_this unenviable spot , when the audience be cold , restless , and in flux ; it prevent late-comers from miss some of the people they have come a long way to hear , and it give the resident musicians a chance to perform before the famous newport audience . 
the jazz three display their sound musicianship , not_only in their own chosen set , but as the emergency accompanists for al_minns + leon_james , the superb jazz dancers who have now be newport performers for three successive years , gradually move_up from a morning seminar on the evolution of the_blues to a spot on the evening program . 
julie_wilson , a vigorous vocalist without many wild twists , sing a set , a large part of_which consist_of such seldom hear old oldies as `` hard-hearted_hannah , the vamp of savannah '' , and the delightful `` sunday '' . 
she frost the cake with the always reliable `` bill_bailey '' . 
from this taste of the 1920 s , we leaped way_out to stan_getz 's private brand of progressive jazz , which do lovely , subtle things for `` baubles , bangles and beads '' , and a_couple_of ballards . 
getz be a difficult musician to categorize . 
he play his sax principally for beauty of tone , rather_than for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations , and he have a quiet way of get_back and restate the melody after the improvising be over . 
in_this he is stick_with tradition , however far removed from_it he may seem to be . 
george_shearing take_over with his well disciplined group , a sextet consist_of vibes , guitar , bass , drums , shearing 's piano and a bongo drummer . 
he meet with enthusiastic audience approval , especially when he swing from jazz to latin_american things like the mambo . 
shearing , himself , seem to me to be play better piano than in his recent newport appearances . 
a very casual , pleasant program - one of those easy-going things that make newport 's afternoon programs such a relaxing delight - was hold again under sunny skies , hot sun , and a fresh_breeze for an audience of at_least a_couple_of thousands who come to newport to hear music rather_than go to the beach . 
divide almost equally into two parts , it consist_of `` the evolution of the_blues '' , narrate by jon_hendricks , who had present it last year at the monterey , calif. , jazz_festival , and an hour-long session of maynard_ferguson and his orchestra , a blasting big_band . 
hendricks ' story was design for children and he have a small audience of small children right_on stage with him . 
trace the_blues from its african roots among the slaves who were bring to this country and the west_indies , he stress the close relationship between the early jazz forms and the music of the negro churches . 
to help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz he have `` big '' miller , as a preacher-singer and hannah_dean , gospel-singer , while oscar_brown_jr. , an extremely talented young_man , do a slave auctioneer 's call , a field-hands ' work_song , and a beautifully sung negro lullaby , `` brown_baby '' , which be one of the truly moving moments of the festival . 
one of those delightful surprise additions , which so frequently occur in jazz programs , be an excellent stint at the drums by the great joe_jones , drum to `` old_man river '' , which seem to have been elect the favorite solo for the boys on the batterie at this year 's concerts . 
demonstrate the primitive african rhythmic backgrounds of the_blues be michael_babatunde_olatunji , who play such native drums as the konga and even do a resounding job slap his own chest . 
he has be on previous newport programs and be one of the sensations of last year 's afternoon concerts . 
hendricks have billy_mitchell , tenor sax ; pony_poindexter , alto sax ; jimmy_witherspoon , blues singer ( and a good one ) , and the ike_isaacs_trio , which has do such wonderful work for two afternoons now , help him with the musical examples . 
it all go very_well . 
pianists who be serious about their work be likely to know the interesting material contain in schubert 's sonatas . 
music_lovers who be not familiar_with this literature may hear an excellent example , play for rca by emil_gilels . 
he has choose sonata_op. 53 in d . 
the playing take both sides of the disc . 
perhaps one of the reasons these sonatas are not program more_often be their great length . 
rhythmic interest , melodic beauty and the expansiveness of the writing be all qualities which hold one 's attention with the gilels playing . 
his technique be ample and his musical ideas are project beautifully . 
the male chorus of the robert_shaw_chorale sing sea shanties in fine style . 
the group is superbly train . 
what a discussion can ensue when the title of_this type of song be in_question . 
do you say chantey , as if the word were derive from the_french word chanter , to sing , or do you say shanty and think_of a roughly built cabin , which derive its name from the french-canadian use of the word chantier , with one of its meanings give as a boat-yard ? 
i say chantey . 
either way , the robert_shaw chorus sing them in fine style with every colorful word and its musical frame spell_out in_terms_of agreeable listening . 
if your favorite song be not here it must be an unfamiliar one . 
the london label offer an operatic recital by ettore_bastianini , a baritone whose fame be international . 
murray_louis and his dance company appear at the henry_street_playhouse on friday and saturday evenings and sunday afternoons in the premiere of his latest work , `` signal '' , and the repetition of an earlier one , `` journal '' . 
`` signal '' is choreograph for three male dancers to an electronic score by alwin_nikolais . 
its abstract decor be by john_hultberg . 
program note read as_follows : 
`` take hands , this urgent visage beckon us '' . 
here , as in `` journal '' , mr._louis has give himself the lion 's share of the dancing , and there be no_doubt that he be capable_of conceive and execute a wide variety of difficult and arresting physical movements . 
indeed , both `` journal '' and `` signal '' qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics . 
but chains of movements be not necessarily communicative , and it be in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing . 
one frequently have the feeling that the order of their movement combinations could be transpose without notable loss of effect , there be too little suggestion of organic relationship and development . 
it may be , of_course , that mr._louis is consciously try to create works that anticipate an age of total automation . 
but it may be , also , that he be merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at_the_present_time . 
one thing be certain , however , and that be that he be far more slavish to the detailed accents , phrasings and contours of the music he deal with than a confident dance creator need be . 
a brisk , satirical spoof of contemporary american mores entitle `` an american_journey '' was given its first new_york performance at hunter_college_playhouse last night by the helen_tamiris-daniel_nagrin_dance_company . 
choreograph by mr._nagrin , the work fill the second_half of a program that also offer the first new_york showing of miss_tamiris ' `` once upon a time '' , as_well as her `` women 's song '' and mr._nagrin 's `` indeterminate figure '' . 
eugene_lester assemble a witty and explicit score for `` an american_journey '' , and malcolm_mccormick give it sprightly imaginative costumes . 
mr._nagrin has describe four `` places '' , each with its scenery and people , add two `` diversions '' , and conclude with `` a toccata for the young '' , a refreshingly underplayed interpretation of rock ' n ' roll dancing . 
the `` places '' could be anywhere , the idiosyncrasies and foibles observe there could be anybody 's , and the laugh be on us all . 
but we need not mind too_much , because mr._nagrin has express it through movement that be diverting and clever almost all_the_way . 
miss_tamiris ' `` once upon a time '' be a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three `` figures '' that bother them somehow . 
unfortunately , the man and woman were not make to appear very interesting at the outset and the menacing figures fail to make them any_more so . 
nor did the dancing involved really seize the attention at_any_time . 
the music here , russell_smith 's `` tetrameron '' , sound good . 
all the performances of the evening be smooth and assured , and the sizable company , with mr._nagrin and marion_scott as its leading dancers , seem to be fine shape . 
the symphony of the air , greatly assist by van_cliburn , last night get its seven-concert beethoven cycle at carnegie_hall off to a good start . 
at_the_same_time the orchestra announce that next season it would be give twenty-five programs at carnegie , and that it would be take these concerts to the suburbs , repeat each of them in five different communities . 
this news , announce by jerome_toobin , the orchestra 's administrative director , bring applause from the 2800 persons who fill the hall . 
they show they be glad that carnegie would have a major orchestra play there so often next season to take_up the slack with the departure to lincoln_center of the new_york philharmonic , the philadelphia_orchestra and the boston_symphony . 
this season the orchestra has already take a step toward the suburbs in_that it is give six subscription concerts for the orchestral_society of westchester in the county_center in white_plains . 
the details of the suburban concerts next season , and the centers in_which they will be give , will be announce later , mr._toobin say . 
the concertos that van_cliburn has been associated with in new_york since his triumphant return from russia in 1958 have be the tchaikovsky , the rachmaninoff_third , and the prokofieff_third . 
it be pleasant last night , therefore , to hear him do something else : a concerto he has recently record , `` the emperor '' . 
the young texas pianist can make great chords ring_out as_well as anyone , so last night the massive sonorities of_this challenging concerto be no hazard to him . 
but they be not what distinguish his performance . 
the elements that did be the introspective slow movement , the beautiful transition to the third movement , and the passages of filigree that lace through the bigger moments of the opening movement and the final rondo . 
mr._cliburn give the slow movement some of the quality of a chopin_nocturne . 
alfred_wallenstein , the conductor , sensitive accompanist that he be , pick_up the idea and lead the orchestra here with a sense of broodinf , poetic mystery . 
the collaboration be remarkable , as it be in both the other movements , too . 
mr._wallenstein , who will lead all_of the concerts in the cycle , also conduct the `` leonore '' overture no. 3 and the fourth_symphony . 
the orchestra be obviously on its mettle and it play most responsively . 
and although there be plenty of vigor in the performance , the ensemble be at its best when the playing be soft and lyrical , yet full_of the suppressed tension that be one of the hallmarks of beethoven . 
igor_oistrakh will be the next soloist on feb. 4 . 
there be times when one suspect that the songs that are drop from musical shows before they reach broadway may really be better than many_of those that are_left in . 
today , in the era of the integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all development of the show , it be understandable that a song , no_matter_how excellent it may be on its own terms , is cut_out because it does not perform the function require of_it . 
in the more casually constructed musicals of the nineteen twenties and nineteen thirties there would seem to have be less reason for eliminate a song of merit . 
yet there be the classic case of the gershwins ' `` the_man_i_love '' . 
deem too static when it was first hear in `` lady be good '' in philadelphia in 1924 , it was drop from the score . 
it was hear again in philadelphia in 1927 in the first version of `` strike_up the band '' and again abandon shortly before the entire show was give_up . 
it finally reach broadway in the second and successful version of `` strike_up the band '' in 1929 . 
( still another song in `` strike_up the band '' - `` i 've_got_a_crush_on_you '' - was retrieve from a 1928 failure , `` treasure_girl '' ) . 
like the gershwins , richard_rodgers and lorenz_hart be loath to let a good song get_away from them . 
if one of mr._rodgers ' melodies seem to deserve a better fate than interment in boston or the obscurity of a broadway failure , mr._hart be likely to deck_out it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance in another show . 
several of these double_entries have been collect by ben_bagley and michael_mcwhinney , along with rodgers and hart songs that disappear permanently en_route to new_york and_others that reach broadway but have not become part of the constantly hear rodgers and hart repertory , in a delightfully refreshing album , rodgers and hart_revisited ( spruce records , 505 fifth_avenue , new_york ) . 
among the particular gems in_this collection be the impudent opening song of `` the garrick gaieties '' , an impressive forecast of the wit and melody that were to come from rodgers and hart in the years that follow ; dorothy_loudon 's raucous listing of the attractions `` at the roxy music_hall '' from `` i marry an angel '' ; and the incisive style with which charlotte_rae deliver the top-drawer hart lyrics of `` i blush '' , a song that was cut from `` a connecticut_yankee '' . 
altogether fifteen virtually unknown rodgers and hart songs are sing by a quintet of able vocalists . 
norman_paris has provide them with extremely effective orchestral accompaniment turn_to the current musical season on broadway , the_most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals , how_to_succeed_in_business_without_really_trying , has been transfer to an original cast album ( r._c._a._victor_loc 1066 ; stereo lso 1066 ) that have some entertaining moments , although it be scarcely as inventive as the praise elicit by the show might lead one to expect . 
robert_morse , sing with comically plaintive earnestness , carry most_of the burden and be responsible_for the high spots in frank_loesser 's score . 
rudy_vallee , who share star billing with mr._morse , make only two appearances . 
he share with mr._morse a parody of the college anthems he once sing while his second song is whisk_away from him by virginia_martin , a girl with a remarkably expressive yip in her voice . 
in_general , mr._loesser has do a more consistent job as lyricist than he has as composer . 
like mr._loesser , jerry_herman be both composer and lyriist for milk and honey ( r._c._a._victor_loc 1065 ; stereo lso 1065 ) , but in_this case it be the music that stand above the lyrics . 
for this story of an american couple who meet and fall_in_love in israel , mr._herman has write songs that be warmly melodious and dance_music that sparkle . 
there be the full-bodied , resourceful voices of robert_weede , mimi_benzell and tommy_rall to make the most of mr._herman 's lilting melodies and , for an occasional change of pace , the bright humor of molly_picon . 
mr._herman has manage to mix musical ideas draw from israel and the standard american ballad style in a manner that stress the basic tunefulness of both idioms . 
not content to create only the music and lyrics , noe ^ l coward also write the book and direct sail away ( capitol_wao 1643 ; stereo swao 1643 ) , a saga of life on a cruise_ship that be not apt to be include among mr._coward 's more memorable works . 
the melodies flow along pleasantly , as mr._coward 's songs usually do , but his lyrics have a tired , cut-to-a-familiar-pattern quality . 
elaine_stritch , who sing with a persuasively warm huskiness , belt some life into most_of her songs , but the other members of the cast sound as lukewarm as mr._coward 's songs . 
with three fine russian films in recent months on world_war 2 , - `` the_house_i_live_in '' , `` the_cranes_are_flying '' and `` ballad of a soldier '' - we have every right to expect a real soviet block-buster in `` the day the war_ended '' . 
it simply is n't , not_by_a_long_shot . 
the artkino presentation , with english titles , open on saturday at the cameo_theatre . 
make no mistake , this gorky_studio drama be a respectable import - aptly grave , carefully write , perform and direct . 
in describe the initial allied occupation of a middle-sized german city , the picture have color , pictorial pull and genuinely moving moments . 
tell strictly from the viewpoint of the russian conquerors , the film compassionately peer over the shoulders of a smitten soviet couple , at both sides of the conflict 's aftermath . 
unfortunately , the whole picture hinge_on this romance , at the expense of everything else . 
tenderly and rather tediously , the camera rivet on the abrupt , deep love of a pretty nurse and a uniformed teacher , complicate by nothing more_than a friend they do n't want to hurt . 
it be the old story , war or no war , and more_than one viewer may recall hollywood 's `` titanic '' , several seasons back , when the paramount concern be for the marital discord of a society dilettante . 
not that the picture be superficial . 
under yakov_segal 's direction , it begin stirringly , as crouch soviet and nazi troops silently scan each other , wait for the first surrender gesture . 
one high-up camera shot be magnificent , as the germans straggle from a cathedral , dot a huge , cobblestone square , and drop their weapons . 
only once in a very long while come a book that give the reader a magic sense of share a rare experience . 
`` ring of bright_water '' by gavin_maxwell be just that - a haunting , warmly personal chronicle of a man , an otter , and a remote cottage in the scottish_west_highlands . 
`` he has marry me with a ring of bright water '' , begin the kathleen_raine poem from which maxwell take his title , and it be this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the author convey . 
the place be camusfearna , the site of a long-vanished sea-village opposite the isle of skye . 
it be a land of long fjords , few people , a single-lane road miles away - and of wild stags , greylag_geese , wild swans , dolphins and porpoises play in the waters . 
how maxwell recount his first coming to camusfearna , his furnish the empty house with beach-drift , the subtle changes in season over ten years , be a moving experience . 
just the evocations of time and place , of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today seem almost lost , would be enough . 
but it be n't . 
there be mijbil , an otter who travel with maxwell - and give maxwell 's name to a new species - from the tigris marshes to his london flat . 
it may sound extravagant to say that there has never be a more engaging animal in_all literature . 
this be not_only a compliment to mijbil , of whom there be a fine series of photographs and drawings in the book , but to the author who has catalogue the saga of a frightened otter cub 's journey by plane from iraq to london , then by train ( where he lie curled in the wash basin play with the water tap ) to camusfearna , with affectionate detail . 
mij , as his owner was soon to learn , have strange , inexplicable habits . 
he like to nip ear lobes of unsuspecting visitors with his needle-sharp teeth . 
he prefer sleep in bed with his head on a pillow . 
systematically he would open and ransack drawers . 
give a small ball or marbles , he would invent games and play by himself for hours . 
with curiosity and elan , he explore every_inch of glen , beach and burn , once strand himself for hours on a ledge high_up a sheer seventy-foot cliff and wait with calm faith to be rescue by maxwell , who nearly lose his life in doing so . 
a year and a day of_this idyll is describe for the reader , one in_which not_only discovery of a new_world of personality is chart , but self-discovery as_well . 
in the solitude of camusfearna there had be no loneliness . 
`` to be quite alone where there be no other human_beings be sharply exhilarating ; it be as though some pressure had suddenly been_lifted , allow an intense awareness & & & a sharpening of the senses '' . 
now , with the increasing interdependence between himself and mij come a knowledge of an obscure need , that of being trust implicitly by some creature . 
two other people in_time share mijbil 's love : `` it remain around us three that his orb revolve when he be not away in his own imponderable world of wave and water ; we be his trinity , and he behave towards us with a mixture of trust and abuse , passion and irritation . 
in_turn each of us in our own way depend , as gods do , upon his worship '' . 
yet the idyll end . 
the brief details of mijbil 's death lend depth to the story , give it an edge of ironic tragedy . 
man , to whom mij give endless affection and fealty , be responsible in the form of a road worker with a pickaxe who somehow become an abstract symbol of the savage in man . 
but then , through a strange coincidence , maxwell manage to acquire idal , a female otter , and the fascinating story start once_more . 
one be not sure who emerge as the main personality of_this book - mijbil , with his rollicking ways , or maxwell himself , poet , portrait_painter , writer , journalist , traveller and zoologist , sensitive but never sentimental recorder of an unusual way_of_life , in a language at_once lyrical and forceful , vivid and unabashed . 
this reviewer read the book when it be first bring_out in england with a sense of discovery and excitement . 
now gavin_maxwell 's ring of bright water has widen to enchant the world . 
the performances of the comedie_francaise be the_most important recent events in the new_york theater . 
they serve to contradict a popular notion that the comedie merely repeat , as accurately as possible , the techniques of act the classics that prevail in the 17 th century . 
on_the_contrary , the old plays are continually being reinterpret , and each new production of a classic have only a brief history at the comedie . 
of_course , the well-received revivals last longer than the others , and that further remind us that the comedie be not insensitive to criticism . 
the directors of the comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient a manner as the broadway producers who , in two instances this season , close their plays after one performance . 
but they be aware_of the world outside , they court public approval , they delight in full houses , and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpret a dramatic classic . 
in france , novel approaches to the classic french plays are frequently attempt . 
the government pay a subsidy for revival of the classics , and this policy attract experimenters who sometimes put moliere 's characters in modern dress and often achieve interesting results . 
so_far as i know , the comedie has never put moliere 's people in the costumes of the 20 th century , but they do reinterpret plays and characters . 
last season , the comedie 's two principal experiments come to grief , and , in consequence , we can expect fairly soon to see still newer productions of racine 's `` phedre '' and moliere 's `` school for wives '' . 
the new `` phedre '' was do in 17 th century setting , instead of ancient_greek ; perhaps that be the comedie 's equivalent for thrust this play 's characters into our own time . 
the speaking of the lines seem excessively slow and stately , possibly in an effort to capture the spirit of 17 th century elegance . 
a_few literary men defend what they take_to_be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama , but the response be mainly hostile and quite violent . 
the new `` school for wives '' was interpret according to a principle that_is become increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy - the idea of turn_into some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character . 
among the moliere specialists of some years ago , louis_jouvet try to humanize some of the clowns , while fernand_ledoux , often perform at the comedie , make them more gross than moliere may have intend . 
apparently , jouvet and ledoux attempt just these dissimilar approaches in the role of arnolphe in `` the school for wives '' . 
i say `` apparently '' although i see jouvet as arnolphe when he visit this country shortly before his death ; by that time , he seem to have drop the tragic playing of the last moments of the comedy . 
arnolphe , it will be recall , be a man of mature years who try to preserve the innocence of his youthful wife-to-be . 
the part can lend itself to serious treatment ; one influential french critic remark : `` pity for arnolphe come_with age '' . 
accordingly , at the comedie last year , jean_meyer play a sympathetic arnolphe and draw criticism for turn the comedy into a tragedy . 
but the stuff of tragedy be not truly present and the play become only comedy act rather slowly . 
wisely , the comedie has bring moliere 's `` tartuffe '' on its tour and has_left `` the school for wives '' at_home . 
tartuffe be the religious hypocrite who court his benefactor 's wife . 
jouvet play him as a sincere zealot , and ledoux , at the comedie , make him a gross buffoon , or_so the historians tell us . 
louis_seigner , who formerly play the deluded benefactor opposite ledoux , be the tartuffe of the present production , which he himself direct . 
his tartuffe observe the golden_mean . 
his red face , his coarse gestures , and his lustful stares bespeak his sensuality . 
but his heavenward glances and his pious speeches be not merely perfunctory ; of_course , they do not reflect sincerity , but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his pious impersonation . 
occasionally , seigner draw some justly deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another . 
the whole role , by_the_way , be a considerable transformation for anyone who has see seigner in his other parts . 
his normal specialty be play the good-natured old_man , frequently stupid or deluded but never mean or sly . 
here , he be , quite persuasively , the very embodiment of meanness and slyness . 
seigner be the dean of the company , the oldest actor in point of continuous service . 
in_that function , he help to rebut another legend about the comedie . 
we are often tell that the comedie have , unfortunately , life-contracts with old actors who be both mediocre and lazy , draw their pay without much acting but probably do real service to the comedie by stay off_the_stage . 
seigner , however , be a fine actor and probably the busiest man in the company ; among his other parts be the leads in `` the bourgeois gentleman '' and `` the imaginary_invalid '' . 
in moliere 's farce , `` the tricks of scapin '' , robert_hirsch undertake another of the great roles . 
here some innovation is attempt . 
to_begin_with , scapin be a trickster in the old tradition of the clever servant who plot the strategy of courtship for his master . 
hirsch 's scapin be healthy , cheerful , energetic , revel in his physical agility and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen whom he serve . 
hirsch say that he has give the role certain qualities he has observe in the city toughs of the real_world . 
and surely his scapin have a fresh directness , a no-nonsense quality that seem to make him his own master and nobody 's servant . 
django_reinhardt , the ill-fated gypsy , be a true artist , one who demonstrate conclusively the power of art to renew itself and flow into many channels . 
there be hardly_a jazz guitarist in the business today who do n't owe something to django . 
and django owe much to louis_armstrong . 
he tell once of how he switch his style of playing to jazz after listen to two old armstrong records he buy in the flea_market in paris . 
it be the first jazz he had hear . 
django , who be_born jean_baptiste_reinhardt in belgium and who die in 1953 in france , be an extraordinary man . 
most_of the fingers on his left_hand were burn_off when he fall_asleep with a cigarette . 
and this be before he begin to play his startlingly beautiful jazz . 
you can catch_up_with him - if you have n't already - on rca-victor 's album . 
`` djangology '' , make_up of tracks he record with stephane_grappelly and the quintet of the hot_club of france . 
this be a choice item and grappely deserve mention too , of_course . 
he be one of the few men in history who play jazz on a violin . 
they play : `` minor_swing '' , `` honeysuckle_rose '' , `` beyond_the_sea '' , `` bricktop '' , `` heavy artillery '' , `` djangology '' , `` after you 've go '' , `` where be you , my love '' ? 
`` i see stars '' , `` lover man '' , `` menilmontant '' and `` swing 42 '' . 
all this be great proceedings - get the minutes . 
kid_ory , the trombonist chicken farmer , be also one of the solid anchor points of jazz . 
he date_back to the days before the first sailing_ship pull into new_orleans . 
his horn has blow loud and clear across the land for more years than he care to remember . 
good time_jazz has release a nice two-record album which he make . 
he is star against alvin_alcorn , trumpet ; phil_gomez , clarinet ; cedric_haywood , piano ; julian_davidson , guitar ; wellman_braud , bass , and minor_hall , drums . 
the set contain `` high_society '' , `` do what ory say '' , `` down home_rag '' , `` careless_love '' , jazz me blues `` , '' weary blues `` , '' original_dixieland_one-step `` , '' bourbon_street_parade `` , '' panama `` , '' toot , toot , tootsie `` , '' oh did n't he ramble `` , '' beale_street blues `` , '' maryland , my maryland `` , '' 1919 rag `` , '' eh , la_bas `` , '' mood_indigo `` , and '' bugle_call rag `` . 
all this will serve to show_off the ory style in fine fashion and be a must for those who want to collect elements of the old-time jazz before it be too late to lay_hands_on the gems . 
mischa_elman share last night 's lewisohn_stadium concert with three american composers . 
his portion of the program - and a big portion it be - consist_of half the major nineteenth-century concertos for the violin : to wit , the mendelssohn and the tchaikovsky . 
that be an evening of music-making that would faze many_a younger man ; mr._elman be 70 years old . 
there be 8000 persons at the stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they hear elman . 
but , with all due respects and allowances , it must truthfully be say that what they hear be more syrupy than sweet , more mannered than musical . 
the occasion be sentimental ; so be the playing . 
the american part of the evening consist_of paul_creston 's dance_overture , william_schuman 's `` chester '' from `` new_england triptych '' and two works of wallingford_riegger , dance rhythms , op. 58 , and a romanza for strings , op. 56 a . 
the creston be purely a potboiler , with spanish , english , french and american dances mixed into the stew . 
the riegger , with its latin hesitation bounce , be just this side of the pale ; like his sweet , attractive romanza , it belong to what the composer call his `` non-dissonant ( mostly ) '' category of works . 
the schuman `` chester '' take_off from an old william billings tune with rousing woodwind and brass effect . 
all these - potboilers or no - provide a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively , colorful , unstuffy works well suited for the great out-of-doors . 
it be nice to have something a_little up-to-date for a change . 
we have alfredo_antonini to thank for this healthy change of diet as_well as the lively performances of the stadium_symphony . 
a woman who undergo artificial_insemination against the wishes of her husband be the unlikely heroine of `` a question of adultery '' , yesterday 's new british import at the apollo . 
since an objective viewer might well conclude that this be not a situation that would often arise , the film 's extensive discussion of the problem seem , at_best , superfluous . 
in its present artless , low-budget form , the subject_matter seem design to invite censorial wrath . 
with julie_london enact the central role with husky-voiced sincerity , the longsuffering heroine be at_least attractive . 
the explanation offer for her conduct be a misguided attempt to save her marriage to a neurotic husband leave sterile as a result of an automobile accident . 
anthony_steel , as the husband , be a jealous type who argue against her course and sue for divorce , label her action adulterous . 
the actor play his role glumly under the lurid direction of don_chaffey , as do basil_sydney as his unsympathetic father and anton_diffring as an innocent bystander . 
after a protracted , hysterical trial scene more notable for the frankness of its language than for dramatic credibility , the jury , to no one 's surprise , leave the legal question unresolved . 
when the husband drop the case and return to his wife , both seem sorry they bring_up the_matter up in_the_first_place . 
so be the audience . 
for its final change of bill in its london season , the leningrad_state_kirov_ballet choose tonight to give one of those choreographic miscellanies known as a `` gala program '' at the royal opera_house , covent_garden . 
no_doubt the underlying idea be to show that for all the elegance and artistry that have distinguish its presentations thus_far , it too could give a circus if it please . 
and please it did , in every sense of the word , for it have the audience shout much of the time in a manner far from typical of london audiences . 
at the end of the program , indeed , there be a demonstration that last for forty-five minutes , and nothing could stop it . 
alexandre_livshitz repeat a fantastic technical bit from the closing number , `` taras_bulba '' , but even then there be a substantial number of diehards who seem determined not to go_home at_all . 
only a plea from the house manager , john_collins , finally break_up the party . 
but for all the manifest intention to `` show_off '' , this be a circus with a difference , for instead of descend in quality to what be known as a popular level , it add further to the evidence that this be a very great dancing company . 
the `` taras_bulba '' excerpt be a rousing version of gogol 's ukrainian folk-tale choreograph by bo_fenster to music of soloviev-sedoi . 
it is dance by some thirty-five men and no women , and it contain everything in the books - lusty comedy , gregarious cavorting , and tricks that only madmen or russians would attempt to make the human_body perform . 
yuri_soloviev , oleg_sokolov , alexei_zhitkov , lev_sokolov , yuri_korneyev and mr._livshitz be the chief soloists , but everybody on stage be magnificent . 
at the other extreme in character be the half-hour excerpt from the petipa-minkus ballet `` bayaderka '' , which open the evening . 
what a man this petipa be ! 
and why do we in the west know so few of his ballets ? 
this scene be a `` white ballet '' in_which a lovelorn hero search for his departed love 's spirit among twenty-eight extraordinarily beautiful `` shadows '' who can all dance like nothing human - which , of_course , be altogether fitting . 
the ensemble enter in a long adagio passage that be of fantastic difficulty , as_well as loveliness , and adagio be the general medium of the piece . 
its ballerina , olga_moiseyeva , perform simple miracles of beauty , and ludmilla_alexeyeva , inna_korneyeva and gabrielle_komleva make_up a threesome of exquisite accomplishments . 
sergei_vikulov , as the lone male , meet the competition well with some brilliant hits , but the work is design to belong to the ladies . 
the middle section of the program was make_up of short numbers , naturally enough of unequal merit , but all_of them pretty good at that . 
they consist_of a new arrangement of `` nutcracker '' excerpts dance stunningly by irina_kolpakova and mr._sokolev , with a large ensemble ; a winning little `` snow_maiden '' variation by the adorable galina_kekisheva ; two of those poetic adagios in greek veils ( and superb esthetic acrobacy ) by alla_osipenko and igor_chernishev in_one_case and inna_zubkovskaya and yuri_kornevey in the other ; an amusing character pas de cinq called `` gossiping_women '' ; a stirring `` flames of paris '' pas_de_deux by xenia_ter-stepanova and alexandre_pavlovsky , and a lovely version of fokine 's `` le_cygne '' by olga_moiseyeva , which had to be repeat . 
vadim_kalentiev be the conductor . 
it be quite an evening ! 
a year ago today , when the democrats were fret and frolic in los_angeles and john_f._kennedy be still only an able and ambitious senator who yearn for the power and responsibility of the presidency , theodore_h._white had already compile masses of notes about the presidential campaign of 1960 . 
as the pace of the quadrennial american political festival accelerate , mr._white took more notes . 
he travel alternately with mr._kennedy and with richard_m._nixon . 
he ask intimate questions and get frank answers from the members of_what he call the candidates ' `` in-groups '' . 
he assemble quantities of facts about the nature of american politics in_general , as_well as about the day-to-day course of the closest presidential election in american history . 
those of us who read the papers may think we know a good_deal about that election ; how little we know of_what there be to be know is made humiliatingly clear by mr._white in `` the making of the president 1960 '' . 
this be a remarkable book and an astonishingly interesting one . 
what might have be only warmed-over topical journalism turn_out to be an eyewitness contribution to history . 
mr._white , who be only a competent novelist , be a brilliant reporter . 
his zest for specific detail , his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere , his tireless industry and his crisply turned prose all contribute to the effectiveness of his book . 
as a dramatic narrative `` the making of the president 1960 '' be continuously engrossing . 
and as an introduction to american politics it be highly educational . 
the author begin this volume with a close-up of mr._kennedy , his family and his entourage wait for the returns . 
he then switch back to a consideration of the seven principal presidential hopefuls : five democrats - senator_hubert_h._humphrey , senator_stuart_symington , senator_lyndon_b._johnson , adlai_e._stevenson and mr._kennedy - and two republicans - governor_rockefeller and mr._nixon . 
then , in chronological order , mr._white cover the primary campaigns , the conventions and the presidential campaign itself . 
in the process he write at_length about many related matters : the importance of race , religion , local tradition , bosses , organizations , zealous volunteers and television . 
mr._white be bluntly frank in his personal opinions . 
he frequently cite intimate details that seem to come straight from the horse 's mouth , from numerous insiders and from mr._kennedy himself ; but never from mr._nixon , who look_on reporters with suspicion and distrust . 
`` rarely in american history has there be a political_campaign that discuss issues less or clarify them less '' , say mr._white . 
mr._nixon , he believe , have no particular political philosophy and mismanage his own campaign . 
although a skillful politician and a courageous and honest man , mr._nixon , mr._white believe , ignore his own top-level planners , waste time and effort in the wrong regions , miss opportunities through indecision and damage his chances on television . 
mr._nixon be `` a broody , moody man , given_to long stretches of introspection ; he trust only himself and his wife . 
he be a man of major talent - but a man of solitary , uncertain impulses . 
he be above_all a friend seeker , almost pathetic in his eagerness to be like . 
he want to identify with people and have a connection with them ; the_least inspiring candidate since alfred_m._landon '' . 
mr._kennedy , mr._white believe , `` had master politics on so many different levels that no other american could match him '' . 
calm , dignified , composed , `` superbly eloquent '' , mr._kennedy always know everything about everybody . 
he enlist a staff of loyal experts and of many zealous volunteers . 
every decision was make quickly on sound grounds . 
efficiency was enforce and nothing was leave to chance . 
mr._kennedy did not neglect to cultivate the personal friendship of reporters . 
mr._white admire him profoundly and leave no_doubt that he be a democrat himself who expect mr._kennedy to be a fine president . 
throughout `` the_making_of_a_president '' mr._white show wonderfully well how the pressures pile_up on candidates , how decisions have constantly to be made , how fatigue and illness and nervous_strain wear_down candidates down , how subordinates play key roles . 
and he makes many interesting comments . 
here be several : 
`` the root question in american politics be always : 
who 's the man to see ? 
to understand american politics be , simply , to know people , to know the relative weight of names - who be heroes , who be straw_men , who control , who does not . 
but to operate in american politics one must go a step further - one must build a bridge to such names , establish a warmth , a personal connection '' . 
`` in the hard life of politics it be well known that no platform nor any program advance by either major american_party have any purpose beyond express_emotion '' . 
`` all platforms be meaningless : the program of either party be what lie_in the vision and conscience of the candidate the party choose to lead it '' . 
nostalgia week at lewisohn_stadium , which had begin with the appearance of the 70 - year-old mischa_elman on tuesday night , continue last night as lily_pons lead the list of celebrities in an evening of french operatic excerpts . 
miss_pons be certainly not 70 - no singer ever be - and yet the rewards of the evening again lie more in pay tribute to a great figure of times go_by than in present accomplishments . 
the better part of gallantry might be , perhaps , to honor her perennial good_looks and her gorgeous rainbow-hued gown , and to chide the orchestra for not play in the same keys in_which she had choose to sing . 
no orchestra , however , could be expect to follow a singer through quite as_many adventures with pitch as miss_pons encounter last night . 
in_all fairness , there be flashes of the great stylist of yesteryear , flashes even of the old consummate vocalism . 
one such moment come in the breathtaking way miss_pons sing the cadenza to meyerbeer 's `` shadow_song '' . 
the years suddenly fall_away at this point . 
on_the_whole , however , one must wonder at just what it be that force a beloved artist to besmirch her own reputation as time march_on inexorably on . 
share the program was the young french-canadian tenor richard_verreau , making his stadium debut on this occasion . 
mr._verreau begin shakily , with a voice that tend toward an unpleasant whiteness when push beyond middle volume . 
later_on this problem vanish , and the `` flower_song '' from bizet 's `` carmen '' was beautifully and intelligently project . 
radio is easily outdistance television in its strides to reach the minority listener . 
lower costs and a larger number of stations be the key factors make such specialization possible . 
the mushrooming of fm outlets , offer concerts ( both jazz and classical ) , lectures , and other special events , be a phenomenon which has have a fair amount of publicity . 
not so well_known be the growth of broadcasting operations aim wholly or partly at negro listeners - an audience which , in the united_states , comprise some 19000000 people with $ 20000000000 to spend each_year . 
of_course , the nonwhite listener do his share of television watching . 
he even buy a_lot_of the products he see advertise - despite_the_fact_that the copy makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely use any but white models in commercials . 
but the growing number of negro-appeal radio_stations , plus evidence of strong listener support of their advertisers , give time salesmen an impressive argument as they approach new prospects . 
it is estimate that more_than 600 stations ( of a total of 3400 ) do a significant amount of programing for the negro . 
at_least 60 stations devote all_of their time to reach this audience in about half of the 50 states . 
these and other figures and comments have been report in a special supplement of sponsor magazine , a trade publication for radio and tv advertisers . 
for 10 years sponsor has issue an annual survey of the size and characteristics of the negro market and of successful techniques for reach this market through radio . 
in_the_past 10 years , sponsor observe , these trends have become apparent : 
negro population in the u._s. has increase 25 per_cent while the white population was grow by 18 per_cent . 
`` the forgotten 15 million '' - as sponsor tag the negro market in its first survey - has become a better-remembered 19 million . 
advertisers are change their attitudes , both as to the significance of_this market and the ways of speak_to it . 
stations program to negro listeners are having to upgrade their shows in_order_to keep pace with rising educational , economic , and cultural levels . 
futhermore , the station which want real prestige must lead or participate in community improvement projects , not simply serve on the air . 
in the last decade the number of negro-appeal radio program hours has rise at_least 15 per_cent , and the number of negro-appeal stations has increase 30 per_cent , according to a research man quote by sponsor . 
a year ago the negro_radio_association was form to spur research which the 30 - odd member stations are sure will bring_in more business . 
the 1960 census underscore the explosive character of the population growth . 
it also bring_home proof of something a casual observer might have miss : that more_than half of the u._s. negroes live outside the southeastern states . 
also , the state with the largest number of negroes be new_york - not in the south at_all . 
in new_york_city , wlib boast `` more community service_programs than any other negro station '' and `` one of the largest negro news staffs in america '' . 
and wwrl 's colorful mobile unit , cruise predominately negro neighborhoods , be a frequent reminder of_that station 's round-the-clock dedication to nonwhite interests . 
recently , wwrl win praise for its expose of particular cases of employment_agency deceit . 
a half-dozen other stations in the new_york area also bid for attention of the city 's negro population , up about 50 per_cent in_the_past decade . 
in_all big cities outside the south , and even in small_towns within the south , radio_stations can be find beam some or all_of their programs at negro listeners . 
the keystone_broadcasting_system 's negro network include 360 affiliated stations , whose signals reach more_than half the total u._s._negro population . 
one question which inevitably crop_up be whether such stations have a future in a nation where the negro is move_into a fully integrated status . 
whatever the long-range impact of integration , the owners of negro-appeal radio_stations these days know they have an audience and that it be loyal . 
advertisers have discover the tendency of negroes to shop for brand names they have hear on stations catering to their special interests . 
and many advertisers have be happy with the results of let a negro disc_jockey phrase the commercial in his own words , work only from a fact sheet . 
what set_apart negro-appeal programing apart from other radio shows ? 
sponsor magazine note the stress on popular negro bands and singers ; rhythm-and-blues mood music ; `` race '' music , folk_songs and melodies , and gospel programs . 
furthermore , news and special presentations inform the listener about groups , projects , and personalities rarely mention on a general-appeal station . 
advertising copy frequently take_into_account matters of special negro concern . 
sponsor quote john_mclendon of the mclendon-ebony station group as say that the southern_negro is become conscious_of quality and and `` does not wish to be associated with radio which be any way degrading to his race ; he tend to shy_away_from the hooting and hollering personalities that originally make negro radio programs famous '' . 
the sociological impact is perhaps most eloquently sum_up in_this quotation of j._walter_carroll of ksan , san_francisco : 
`` negro-appeal radio be more important to the negro today , because it provide a direct and powerful mirror in_which the negro can hear and see his ambitions , achievements and desires . 
it will continue to be important as a means of orientation to the negro , seek to become urbanized , as he try to make adjustment to the urban life . 
negro radio be vitally necessary during the process of assimilation '' . 
presentation of `` the life and times of john_sloan '' in the delaware_art_center here suggest a current nostalgia for human values in art . 
stage by way of announce the gift of a large and intimate sloan collection by the artist 's widow , helen_farr_sloan , to the wilmington_society of the fine_arts , the exhibition present a survey of sloan 's work . 
from early family portraits , paint before he enter the schools of the pennsylvania_academy of the fine_arts , the chronology extend_to a group of paintings execute in his last year ( 1951 ) and still part of his estate . 
few artists have leave a life work so eloquent of the period in_which they live . 
few who have paint the scenes around them have done so with so little bitterness . 
the paintings , drawings , prints , and illustrations all reflect the manners , costumes , and mores of america in the first_half of the present century . 
obviously sloan 's early years were influence by his close friend robert_henri . 
as early as 1928 , however , the sloan style begin to change . 
the dark pigments of the early work were supersede by a brighter palette . 
the solidity of brush stroke yield to a hatching technique that finally lead to virtual abandonment of american genres in favor of single figure studies and studio nudes . 
the exhibition present all phases of sloan 's many-sided art . 
in_addition to the paintings be drawings , prints , and illustrations . 
sloan create such works for newspaper supplements before syndication throw him out of a job and send him to roam the streets of new_york , thereby build for america an incomparable city survey from paintings of mcsorley 's saloon to breezy clotheslines on city roofs . 
one of the_most appealing of the rooftop canvases be `` sun and wind on the roof '' , with a woman and child brace themselves against flapping clothes and flying birds . 
although there be landscapes in the show ( one of the strongest be a vista of `` gloucester_harbor '' in 1915 ) , the human element be the compelling factor in sloan 's art . 
significant be such canvases as `` bleeker_street , saturday_night '' , with its typically american crowd ( sloan never go abroad ) ; the multifigure `` traveling_carnival '' , in_which action is vivify by lighting ; or `` carmine_theater , 1912 '' , the only canvas with an ash can ( and foraging dog ) , although sloan be a member of the famous `` eight '' , and of the so-called `` ash-can_school '' , a term he resent . 
not all the paintings , however , be of cities . 
the exhibition touch briefly on his sojourn in the southwest ( `` koshare in the dust '' , a vigorous indian dance , and landscapes suggest the influence of western color on his palette ) . 
the fact that sloan be an extrovert , concern primarily with what he see , add greatly to the value of his art as a human chronicle . 
there be 151 items in the wilmington show , include one painting by each member of the `` eight '' , as_well as work by sloan 's friends and students . 
supplement the actual art are memorabilia - correspondence , diaries , books from the artist 's library , etc. . 
all belong_to the collection being give to wilmington over a period of years by mrs._sloan , who has cherish such revelatory items ever since she first study with sloan at the art_students league , new_york , in the 1920 's . 
to enable students and the public to spot sloan forgeries , the delaware_art_center ( according to its director , bruce_st._john ) will maintain a complete file of photographs of all sloan works , as_well as a card index file . 
the entire sloan collection will be make available at the center to all serious art_students and historians . 
the current exhibition , which remain on view through oct. 29 , has tap 14 major collections and many private sources . 
any musician play beethoven here , where beethoven be_born , be likely to examine his own interpretations with special care . 
in_a_sense , he is offer bonn what its famous son ( who leave as a youth ) never did - the sound of the composer 's mature style . 
robert_riefling , who give the only piano recital of the recently concluded 23 rd beethoven_festival , penetrate deep into the spirit of the style . 
his readings be careful without be fussy , and they be authoritative without be presumptuous . 
the 32 c minor variations with which he open move fluently yet logically from one to another , leave the right impression of abundance under discipline . 
the d minor sonata , op. 31 no. 2 , introduce by dynamically shaped arpeggios , be most engaging in its moments of quasi-recitative - single lines in_which the fingers seem to be feel their way toward the idea to come . 
these inwardly dramatic moments show the kind_of `` opera style '' of_which beethoven be genuinely capable , but which did not take_kindly_to so kindly to the mechanics of staging . 
two late sonatas , op. 110 and 111 , were play with similar insight , the disarming simplicities of the op. 111 adagio make plain without ever become obvious . 
the two were separate from each other by the six bagatelles of op. 126 . 
herr_riefling , in everything he give his large beethoven_hall audience , prove himself as an interpreter of unobtrusive authority . 
volker_wangenheim , who conduct bonn 's sta ^ dtisches orchester on the following evening , make one more conscious_of the process of interpretation . 
herr_wangenheim has only recently become the city 's music_director , and be a young_man with a clear flair for the podium . 
but he weight the eighth_symphony , at_times , with a shuddering subjectivity which seem considerably at_odds with the music . 
he might have been hope , to all appearances , that this relatively sunny symphony , in conjunction with the choral_fantasy at the end of the program , could amount to something like the ninth ; but no amount of head-tossing could make it so . 
the conductor 's preoccupation with the business of starting and stopping cause occasional raggedness , as with the first orchestra entrance in the fourth_piano_concerto , but when he put his deliberations and obsequies aside and let the music move as design , it did so with plenty of spring . 
the concerto 's soloist , hans_richter-haaser , play with compensatory ease and economy , though without the consummate plasticity to_which we had been treat on the previous evening by herr_riefling . 
his be a burgomaster 's beethoven , solid and sensible . 
everybody return after intermission for the miscellaneous sweepings of the fantasy for piano , chorus , and orchestra in c minor , make_up by its composer to fill_out one of his programs . 
the entrance of the sta ^ dtisches gesangverein ( bonn 's civic chorus ) be worth all the waiting , however , as the young rhenish voices finally bring the music to life . 
the last program of_this festival , which during two_weeks had sample most compositional categories , bring the cologne_rundfunk-sinfonie-orchester and rundfunkchor to bonn 's gold-filled hall for a performance of the missa_solemnis . 
a tribe in ancient india believe the earth be a huge tea_tray rest_on the backs of three giant elephants , which in_turn stand on the shell of a great tortoise . 
this theory eventually prove inexact . 
but the primitive method of explain the unknown with what be known bear at_least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science . 
it be the business of cosmologists , the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe , to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by use keys that have click_open other doors . 
these keys be the working_principles of physics , mathematics and astronomy , principles which are then extrapolate , or project , to explain phenomena of_which we have little or no direct knowledge . 
in the autumn of 1959 , the_british broadcasting_corporation present a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology . 
three of these men discuss major theories of the universe while the other act_as a moderator . 
the participants be professor_h._bondi , professor of mathematics at king 's college , london ; dr._w._b._bonnor , reader in mathematics at queen_elizabeth_college , london ; dr._r._a._lyttleton , a lecturer at st._john 's college , cambridge , and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the university of cambridge ; and dr._g._j._whitrow , reader in applied_mathematics at the imperial_college of science and technology , london . 
dr._whitrow function as moderator . 
the programs were so well receive by the_british public that the arguments have been publish in a totally engrossing little book called , `` rival theories of cosmology '' . 
dr._bonnor begin with a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe , base on the general theory_of_relativity . 
first_of_all , and this has been calculate by observation , the universe is expand - that_is , the galaxies are recede from each other at immense speeds . 
because of_this dr._bonnor hold that the universe is become more thinly populate by stars and whatever else be there . 
this expansion has been go_on for an estimated eight billion years . 
dr._bonnor support the idea that the universe both expand and contract , that in several billion years the expansion will slow_up and reverse itself and that the contraction will set_in . 
then , after many_more billions of years , when all the galaxies are whistling toward a common center , this movement will slow_down and reverse itself again . 
professor_bondi disagree with the expansion-contraction theory . 
he support the steady-state theory which hold that matter is continually being create in space . 
for this reason , he say , the density of the universe always remain the same even_though the galaxies are zoom away in_all_directions . 
new galaxies are forever being form to fill_in the gaps leave by the receding galaxies . 
if this be true , then the universe today look just_as it did millions of years ago and as it will look millions of years hence , even_though the universe is expand . 
for new galaxies to be create , professor_bondi declare , it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen_atom to be create in an area the size of your living_room once every few million years . 
he contend this idea does n't conflict with experiments on_which the principle of conservation_of_matter and energy is base because some slight error must be assume in such experiments . 
dr._lyttleton back the theory that we live in an electric universe and this theory start with the behavior of protons and electrons . 
protons and electrons bear opposite electrical charges which make them attract each other , and when they be joined they make_up an atom of hydrogen - the basic building_block of matter . 
the charges of the electron and proton are believe to be exactly equal and opposite , but dr._lyttleton be not so sure . 
suppose , say dr._lyttleton , the proton have a slightly greater charge than the electron ( so slight it be presently immeasurable ) . 
this would give the hydrogen_atom a slight charge-excess . 
now if one hydrogen_atom were place at the surface of a large sphere of hydrogen_atoms , it would be subject both to the gravitation of the sphere and the charge-excess of all those atoms in the sphere . 
because electrical forces ( the charge-excess ) be far more powerful than gravitation , the surface hydrogen_atoms would shoot away from the sphere . 
dr._lyttleton then imagine the universe as a large hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shoot away from_it . 
this , he claim , would reasonably account_for the expansion of the universe . 
this slim book , while give the reader only a fleeting glimpse of the scientific mind confront the universe , have the appeal that informed conversation always have . 
several photographs and charts of galaxies help the non-scientist keep_up with the discussion , and the smooth language indicate the contributors be determined to avoid the jargon that seem to work its way into almost every field . 
it be clear from this discussion that cosmologists of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man-made satellite can be equip with optical_devices which will open_up new vistas to science . 
presently , the intense absorption of ultra-violet rays in the earth 's atmosphere seriously hinder ground observation . 
these scientists be convinced that a telescope unclouded by the earth 's gases will go_a_long_way toward bolster or destroy cosmic theories . 
there would seem to be some small solace in the prospect that the missile race between nations is at_the_same_time accelerate the study of the space around us , give us a long-sought ladder from which to peer at alien regions . 
in doing_away_with the tea_tray , the elephants and the giant_tortoise , science has develop a series of rationally defensible explanations of the cosmos . 
and although the universe may forever defy understanding , it might even now be find its match in the imagination of man . 
`` roots '' , the new play at the brand-new mayfair_theater on 46 th st. which has been make_over from a night club , be about the intellectual and spiritual awakening of an english farm_girl . 
highly successful in england before its transfer to new_york , most_of `` roots '' be as relentlessly dour as the trappings of the small new theater be gaudy . 
only in its final scene , where beatie_bryant ( mary_doyle ) shake_off the disappointment of being jilt by her intellectual lover and proclaim her emancipation do we get much which make worthwhile the series of boorish rustic happenings we have have to watch for most_of the first two and one-half acts . 
the burden of mr._wesker 's message be that people live close_to the soil ( at_least in england ) be not the happy , fine , strong , natural , earthy people city-bred intellectuals imagine . 
rather they be genuine clods , proud_of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminating influences of aesthetics or thought . 
they care no_more for politics , say mr._wesker , than they do for a symphony . 
seem to have roots in the soil , they actually have none in life . 
they dwell , in_short , in the doltish twilight in_which peasants and serfs of the past are commonly report to have live . 
but this be a theme which does not take so_much time to state as mr._wesker dedicate to_it . 
so_much untidiness of mind and household does not attract the interest of the theatergoer ( unless he has been live in a gilded palace , perhaps , and want a real big heap of contrast ) . 
the messy meals , the washing of dishes , the drying of clothes may be realism , but there be such a thing as redundancy . 
now for the good points . 
miss_doyle as beatie have a great fund of animal spirits , a strong voice and a warm smile . 
she be just home from a sojourn in london where she has become the sweetheart of a young fellow name ronnie ( we never do see him ) and has been subject to a first course in thinking and appreciating , include a dose of good british socialism . 
but while she be able to tell her retarded family about the new_world she has see open before her , ronnie has not be able to observe her progress , and instead of appear at a family party to be look over like a new bull , he send beatie a letter of dismissal . 
beatie , get no sympathy for her misfortune , soon rally and find that although she has lose a lover she has gain her freedom . 
despite a too long sustained declamatory flight , this final speech be convincing , and we see why british audiences apparently were impress by `` roots '' . 
there be several fairly good minor portraits in the play , include william_hansen 's impersonation of a stubborn , rather pathetic father , and katherine_squire 's vigorous characterization of a farm mother who brook no hifalutin ' nonsense from her daughter , or anyone else . 
but i be afraid mr._wesker 's meat and potatoes dish be n't well seasoned enough for local audiences . 
shakespeare have a word for everything , even for the rain that disrupt wednesday night 's `` much ado about nothing '' open the season of free theatre in central_park . 
the new_york shakespeare_festival , which is use the wollman_memorial skating_rink while its theatre near the belvedere is being complete , begin bravely . 
joseph_papp , impassioned founder of the festival and director of `` much ado '' , have a vibrant , colorful production under_way . 
use a wide stage resourcefully he mingle music and dance with shakespeare 's words in a spirited mixture . 
the audience fill all the seats inside the wollman enclosure and overflow onto the lawns outside the fence . 
the barbed sallies of beatrice and benedick , so contemporary to a public inure to the humor of insult , raise chuckles . 
the simple-minded comedy of dogberry and verges , also familiar in a day that respond easily to jokes skim_off the top of writers ' heads , evoke laughter . 
the vivacity of the masquers ' party at leonato 's palace , with the spanish motif in the music and dancing in honor of the visiting prince of arragon , cast a spell of delight . 
as `` much ado '' turn serious while the insipid claudio reject hero at the altar , a sprinkle begin to fall . 
at_first hardly_a person in the audience move , although some umbrellas were open . 
but the rain come more heavily , and men and women in light summer clothes begin to depart . 
the grieving hero and her father , leonato , follow by the friar , leave the stage . 
a voice on the loudspeaker_system announce that if the rain let_up the performance would resume in ten minutes . 
more_than half the audience depart . 
some remain in the wollman enclosure , fortify with raincoats or with newspapers to cover their heads . 
others huddle under the trees outside the fence . 
twenty minutes after the interruption , although it was still rain , the play was resume at the point in the fourth act where it had been stop . 
beatrice ( nan_martin ) and benedick ( j._d._cannon ) take their places on_the_stage . 
in their very first speeches it was clear that shakespeare , like a nostradamus , had foresee this moment . 
say benedick : `` lady_beatrice , have you weep all this while '' ? 
reply beatrice : `` yea , and i will weep a while longer '' . 
the heavens refuse to give_up their weeping . 
the gallant company complete act 4 , and get_through part of act 5 , . 
but the final scenes could not be play . 
if any among the hardy hundreds who sit in the downpour be in doubt about how it come_out , let them take comfort . 
`` much ado '' end happily . 
the parks_department has do an admirable job of prepare the wollman_rink for shakespeare . 
one could hardly blame newbold_morris , the parks_commissioner , for devote so_much grateful mention to the department 's technicians who at short notice provide the stage with its rising platforms , its balcony , its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the villains . 
eldon_elder , who design the stage , also create a gay , spacious set that blend attractively with the park background and shakespeare 's lighthearted mood . 
mr._papp has direct a performance that have verve and pace , although he has tolerate obvious business to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency of style would be preferable . 
elisabeth_schwarzkopf sing so magnificently saturday night at hunter_college that it seem a pity to have_to register any complaints . 
still a demurrer or two must be enter . 
schwarzkopf be , of_course , schwarzkopf . 
for style and assurance , for a supreme and regal bearing there be still no one who can touch her . 
if the voice be just a shade less glorious than it used_to be , it be still a beautiful instrument , controlled and flexible . 
put to the service of lieder of schubert , brahms , strauss and wolf in a dramatical and musical way , it make its effect with ease and precision . 
but what has been happen recently might be describe as creeping mannerism . 
instead of her old confidence in the simplest , purest , most moving musical expression , miss_schwarzkopf is let herself be tempt by the classic sin of artistic pride - that subtle vanity that sometimes mislead a great artist into think that he or she can somehow better the music by bring to it something extra , some personal dramatic touch impose from_the_outside . 
the symptoms saturday night be unmistakable . 
clever light songs be overly coy , tragic songs a_little too melodramatic . 
there be an extra pause here , a gasp or a sigh there , here_and_there an extra little twist of a word or note , all_in the interest of effect . 
the result be like that of a beautiful painting with some of the highlights touch_up almost to_the_point of garishness . 
there be stunning musical_phrases too , and sometimes the deepest kind_of musical and poetic absorption and communication . 
miss_schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist , john_wustman , often achieve the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition . 
all the more reason why there should have be no place for the frills ; miss_schwarzkopf be too great an artist to need them . 
the dance , dancers and dance enthusiasts ( 8500 of them ) have a much better time of_it at lewisohn_stadium on saturday night than all had have two nights earlier , when stadium concerts present the first of two dance programs . 
on saturday , the orchestra was sensibly situated down on the field , the stage floor be apparently in decent condition for dancing , and the order of the program improve . 
there be , additionally , a bonus for the saturday-night patrons . 
alvin_ailey and carmen_de_lavallade appear in the first new_york performance of mr._ailey 's `` roots of the_blues '' , a work give its premiere three weeks ago at the boston_arts_festival . 
otherwise , the program include , as on thursday , the taras-tchaikovsky `` design for strings '' , the dollar-britten `` divertimento '' , the dollar-de_banfield `` the duel '' and the pas_de_deux from `` the nutcracker '' . 
maria_tallchief and erik_bruhn , who dance the `` nutcracker '' pas_de_deux , were also see in the petipa-minkus pas_de_deux from `` don_quixote '' , another brilliant showpiece that display their technical prowess handsomely . 
among the other solo ballet_dancers of the evening , elisabeth_carroll and ivan_allen be particularly impressive in their roles in `` the duel '' , a work that depend_upon so_much upon the precision and incisiveness of the two principal combatants . 
mr._ailey 's `` roots of the_blues '' , an earthy and very human modern_dance work , provide strong contrast to the ballet selections of the evening . 
as brother_john_sellers sing five `` blues '' to the guitar and drum accompaniments of bruce_langhorne and shep_shepard , mr._ailey and miss_de_lavallade go_through volatile dances that be by turns insinuating , threatening , contemptuous and ecstatic . 
their props be two stepladders , a chair and a palm fan . 
he wear the clothes of a laborer , and she be wondrously seductive in a yellow and orange dress . 
the cat-like sinuousness and agility of both dancers were exploit in leaps , lifts , crawls and slides that be almost invariably compelling in a work of strong , sometimes almost frightening , tensions . 
`` roots of the_blues '' may_not be for gentle souls , but others should welcome its super-charged impact . 
`` perhaps it be better to stay at home . 
the armchair traveler preserve his illusions '' . 
this somewhat cynical comment may be_found in `` blue skies , brown_studies '' , a collection of travel essays by william_sansom , who would never consider stay home for long . 
mr._sansom be english , bearded , formidably cultivated , the versatile author of numerous volumes of short_stories , of novels and of pieces that be neither short_stories nor travel articles but something midway between . 
the only man alive who seem qualified by his learning , his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance of language to inherit the literary mantle of sacheverell_sitwell , mr._sansom write of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration worthy of a pastry chef create a wedding_cake for the marriage of a hungarian beauty ( her third ) and an american multimillionaire ( his fourth ) . 
the result be rather wonderful , but so rich as to be indigestible if take in too thick slices . 
there be sixteen essays in `` blue skies , brown_studies '' . 
most_of them were write between 1953 and 1960 and originally appear in various magazines . 
all be well written and be overwritten . 
but , even if mr._sansom labor too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from his travel experiences than the limits of language allow , he still can charm and astound . 
too many books and articles are just assemble by put one word after another . 
mr._sansom actually write his with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence , with an intense relish in_all the metaphorical resources of english , with a thick shower of sophisticated , cultural references . 
`` i like to sniff a place , and reproduce what it really smell and look_like , its color , its particular kind_of life '' . 
this be an exact description of_what mr._sansom do . 
he ignore guidebook facts . 
he only rarely tell a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketch an individual or quote his opinions . 
it be an over-all impression mr._sansom strive for , an impression compound of visual details , of a savory mixture of smells , of much loving attention to architecture and scenery , of lights and shadows , of intangibles of atmosphere and of echoes of the past . 
william_sansom write only about europe in_this book and frequently of such familiar places as london , vienna , the_french riviera and the norwegian fjords . 
but no_matter what he write about he bring to his subject his own original mind and his own sensitive reactions . 
`` a writer live , at_best , in a state of astonishment '' , he say . 
`` beneath any feeling he have of the good or the evil of the world lie a deeper one of wonder at it all . 
to transmit that feeling he write '' . 
this may_not be true of many writers , but it certainly be true of mr._sansom . 
so in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of st._torpetius that still persist in st._tropez ; at the sun and the heat of mediterranean lands , always much brighter and hotter to an englishman than to an american used_to summers in new_york or kansas_city ; at the supreme delights to be find in one of the world 's finest restaurants , la_bonne_auberge , which be situated on the seacoast twenty miles west of the nice airport ; and at the infinite variety of london . 
mr._sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular way which recall ( to those who recall easily ) the statues of bernini and the gigantic paintings of tintoretto . 
he can coin a neat phrase : `` a street spattered with an invigoration of people '' ; tulips with `` petals wide and shaggy as a spaniel 's ears '' ; after a snowstorm a landscape smelling `` of woodsmoke and clarity '' . 
and , for all his lacquered , almost byzantine self-consciousness , he can make one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison . 
in one of his best essays mr._sansom express his enthusiasm for the many country mansions design by andrea_palladio himself that dot the environs of vicenza . 
how far that pedimented and pillared style has shed its influence mr._sansom remind us thus : 
`` the white colonnaded , cedar-roofed southern mansion be directly traceable via the grey and buff stone of grey-skied england to the golden stucco of one particular part of the_blue south , the palladian orbit stretch out from vicenza : the old mind of andrea_palladio still smile from behind many_an old rocking_chair on a southern porch , the deep friezes of his architectonic music rise firm above the shallower freeze in the kitchen , his feeling for light and shade bring a glitter from a tall mint_julep , his sense of columns frame the warm velvet night has bring_together a_million couple of mating lips '' . 
nice , even if a_trifle gaudy . 
`` blue skies , brown_studies '' is illustrate with numerous excellent photographs . 
in recent days there have be extensive lamentations over the absence of original drama on television , but not for years have many regret the passing of new plays on radio . 
wbai , the listener-supported outlet on the frequency-modulation band , has decide to do what it can to correct this aural void . 
yesterday it offer `` poise for violence '' , by jean_reavey . 
wbai be on the right track : in the sound medium there has be excessive emphasis on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre , as the canadian and british broadcasting corporations continue to demonstrate . 
unfortunately , `` poised for violence '' be not the happiest vehicle with which to make the point . 
mrs._reavey 's work is write for the stage - it is mention for an off-broadway production in the fall - and , in_addition , employ an avant-garde structure that particularly need to be see if comprehension be to be encourage . 
the play 's device be to explore society 's obsession with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group of artist 's models who remain part of someone else 's painting rather_than just be themselves . 
in a succession of scenes they appear in different guises - patrons of a cafe , performers in a circus and participants in a family picnic - but in each instance they inevitably put ugliness before beauty . 
somewhere in mrs._reavey 's play there be both protest and aspiration of merit . 
but its relentless discursiveness and determined complexity be so overwhelming that after an hour and a half a listener 's stamina begin to wilt . 
moreover , her central figures are so busily fulfill their multitudinous assignments that none emerge as an arresting individual in his own right or as a provocative symbol of mankind 's ills . 
but quite conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the work is offer in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve the burden on the author 's words . 
which in itself be an immediate reward of the wbai experiment ; good radio drama have its own special demands that badly need reinvigoration . 
a weekly showcase for contemporary music , from the austere archaism of stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music , is celebrate its fourth anniversary this month . 
titled `` what 's new in music '' ? the enterprising program is hear saturday afternoons on radio_station wqxr . 
the brief notes introduce each work offer salient historical or technical points , and many listeners be probably grateful for being intelligently take by the hand through an often difficult maze . 
the show is program and write by the station 's assistant continuity editor , chuck_briefer . 
the first saturday in each_month is set_aside for new recordings . 
last saturday 's interesting melange include ernst_toch , karlheinz_stockhausen , richard_yardumian and a brief excerpt from a new `` space '' opera by the swedish composer , karl-birger_blomdahl . 
other saturdays are devoted_to studies of a selected american composer , a particular type of music or the music of a given country . 
it be commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is set_aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene . 
but one wish , when the appetite is whet , as it be in the case of the all-too-brief excerpt from the blomdahl opera , that further opportunity would be provide both for hear the works in their entirety and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions . 
the moiseyev_dance_company drop_in at madison_square_garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before it bring its long american tour to a close . 
it is not simply give a repetition of the program it give during its new_york engagement earlier this season , but has bring back many_of the numbers that be on the bill when it pay us its first visit and win everybody 's heart . 
it be good to see those numbers again . 
the `` suite of old_russian dances '' that open that inaugural program with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and build steadily into typical moiseyev vigor and warmth ; the amusing `` yurochka '' , in_which a hard-to-please young_man is give his come-uppance ; the lovely ( and of_course vigorous ) `` polyanka '' or `` the meadow '' ; the three moldavian dances entitled `` zhok '' ; the sweet and funny little dance about potato planting called `` bul ' ba '' ; and the hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day called `` city_quadrille '' be all just_as good as one remember them to have be , and they be welcome back . 
so , for_that_matter , be the newer dances - the `` kalmuk_dance '' with its animal movements , that genial juggling act by sergei_tsvetkov called `` the platter '' , the rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called `` summer '' , `` the three shepherds '' of azerbaijan hop up on their staffs , and , of_course , the trenchant `` rock ' n ' roll '' . 
as autumn start its annual sweep , few americans and canadians realize how fortunate they be in have the world 's finest fall coloring . 
spectacular displays of_this sort be relatively rare in the entire land surface of the earth . 
the only other regions so blessed be the_british isles , western europe , eastern china , southern chile and parts of japan , new_zealand and tasmania . 
their autumn tints be all fairly low keyed compare with the fiery stabs of crimson , gold , purple , bronze , blue and vermilion that flame_up in north_america . 
jack_frost be not really responsible_for this great seasonal spectacle ; in_fact , a freezing autumn dull the blaze . 
the best effects come from a combination of temperate climate and plenty of late-summer rain , follow by sunny days and cool nights . 
foliage pilgrimages , either organized or individual , are become an autumn item for more_and_more americans each_year . 
below be a specific guide , keyed to the calendar . 
late september find quebec 's color at its peak , especially in the laurentian hills and in the area south of the st._lawrence_river . 
in the maritime_provinces farther east , the tones be a_little quieter . 
ontario 's foliage be most vivid from about sept. 23 to oct. 10 , with both muskoka ( 100 miles north of toronto ) and haliburton ( 125 miles northwest of toronto ) hold color cavalcades start sept. 23 . 
in the canadian rockies , great groves of aspen are already glint gold . 
vermont 's sugar_maples be scarlet from sept. 25 to oct. 15 , and often hit a height in early october . 
new_hampshire figure its peak around columbus_day and boast of all its hardwoods include the yellow of the birches . 
the shades tend to be a_little softer in the forests that blanket so_much of maine . 
in western massachusetts and northwest connecticut , the berkshires be at their vibrant prime the first week of october . 
the adirondacks blaze brightest in early october , choice routes be 9 n from saratoga up_to lake_george and 73 and 86 in the lake_placid area . 
farther south in new_york there be a heavy haze of color over the catskills in mid-october , notably along routes 23 and 23 a . 
about the same time the alleghenies and poconos in pennsylvania be magnificent - renovo hold its annual flaming foliage festival on oct. 14 , 15 . 
new_jersey 's color vary from staccato to pastel all_the_way from the delaware water_gap to cape_may . 
during the first_half of october the_blue ridge and other parts of the appalachians provide a spectacle stretch from maryland and west_virginia to georgia . 
the_most brilliant displays be along the skyline_drive above virginia 's shenandoah_valley and throughout the great smokies between north_carolina and tennessee . 
michigan , wisconsin and minnesota have many superb stretches of color which reach their height from the last few days of september well into october , especially in their northern sections , e._g. , wisconsin 's vilas_county whose colorama celebration be sept. 29 - oct .8 . 
in wisconsin , take route 55 north of shawano or routes 78 and 60 from portage to prairie_du_chien . 
in michigan , there be fine color on route 27 up_to the mackinac straits , while the views around marquette and iron_mountain in the upper_peninsula be spectacular . 
in minnesota , arrowhead_county and route 53 north to international_falls be outstanding . 
farther south , there be attractive patches all_the_way to the ozarks , with some seasonal peaks as late as early november . 
illinois ' shawnee_national_forest , missouri 's iron_county and the maples of hiawatha , kan. should be at their best in mid-october . 
the rockies have many `` aspencades '' , which be organized tours of the aspen areas with frequent stops at vantage_points for view the golden panoramas . 
in colorado , ouray have its fall_color_week_sept. 22 - 29 , rye and salida both sponsor aspencades sept. 24 , and steamboat_springs have a week-long aspencade_sept. 25 - 30 . 
new_mexico 's biggest be at ruidoso_oct. 7 , 8 , while alamogordo and cloudcroft cooperate in similar trips oct. 1 . 
two sharply contrasting places design for public enjoyment be now on display . 
the corn palace at mitchell , s._dak. , `` the world 's corniest building '' , have a carnival through sept. 23 headline the three stooges and pee_wee_hunt . 
since 1892 ears of red , yellow , purple and white corn have annually been nail to 11 big picture panels to create hugh `` paintings '' . 
the 1961 theme be the dakota_territorial_centennial , with the pictures include the lewis and clark expedition , the first river steamboat , the 1876 gold_rush , a_little red schoolhouse on the prairie , and today 's construction of large missouri_river reservoirs . 
the panels will stay up until they are replace next summer . 
longwood_gardens , near kennett_square , pa. ( about 12 miles from wilmington , del . ) , was develop and heavily endow by the late pierre_s._du_pont . 
every wednesday night through oct. 11 there will be an elaborate colored fountain display , with 229 nozzles throw jets of water up_to 130 feet . 
the `` peacock tail '' nozzle throw a giant fan of water 100 feet wide and 40 feet high . 
the gardens themselves be open free_of_charge the year round , and the 192 permanent employes make sure that not a dead or wilted flower is ever see indoors or out by any visitor . 
the greenhouses alone cover 3 - 1 2 acres . 
carson_mccullers , after a long , painful illness that might have crush a less-indomitable soul , has come_back with an absolute gem of a novel which jump high on best-seller lists even before official publication . 
though the subject - segregation in her native south - has been thoroughly work , miss_mccullers use her poet 's instinct and storyteller 's skill to reaffirm her place at the very top of modern american writing . 
with an art that almost conceal art , j._d._salinger can create a fictional world so authentic that it hurt . 
here , in the_most eagerly awaited novel of the season ( his first since the catcher in the rye ) , he tell of a college_girl in flight from the life around her and the tart but sympathetic help she get from her 25 - year-old brother . 
althea_urn .

a year ago it was bruit that the primary character in erich_maria_remarque 's new novel was base on the marquis_alfonso de portago , the spanish nobleman who die drive in the mille_miglia automobile_race of 1957 . 
if this be in_fact mr._remarque 's intention he has achieve a notable failure . 
clerfayt of `` heaven have no favorites '' resemble portago only in_that he be male and a race-driver - quite a bad race-driver , whereas portago be a good one . 
he be a dull , unformed , and aimless person ; the twelfth marquis de portago be intelligent , purposeful , and passionate . 
one look_forward to mr._remarque 's ninth book if only because not even a reasonably good novel has yet been write ground on automobile racing , as dramatic a sport as mankind has devise . 
unhappily , `` heaven have no favorites '' does not alter the record except to add one more bad book to the list . 
mr._remarque 's conception of_this novel be sound and perhaps even noble . 
he propose throw together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery . 
his treatment of_it be something else . 
his heroine choose to die - the price of recovery , years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium , be higher than she wish to pay . 
her lover precede her in death , at the wheel , and presumably he too has choose . 
between the first meeting of clerfayt and lillian and this dismal denouement , mr._remarque has lay_down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse , some demure and rather fetching love-making , pleasant talk about some of the countryside and restaurants of europe , and a modicum of automobile racing . 
the ramblings on life , death , and the wonder of_it all be distressing ; the love-making , perhaps because it be pale and low-key when one has been condition to expect harsh colors and explicitness , be often charming ; the automobile racing bear little relation_to reality . 
this latter failure be more_than merely bad reportage and it be distinctly more important than it would have be had the author draw clerfayt as , say , a tournament golfer . 
hazards to life and limb on the golf_course , while existent , be actuarially insignificant . 
race-drivers , on_the_other_hand , are quite often kill on the circuit , and since it be obviously mr._remarque 's intention to establish automobile racing as life in microcosm , one might reasonably have expect him to demonstrate precise knowledge not_only of techniques but of mores and attitudes . 
he do not . 
the jacket biography describe him as a former racing driver , and he may indeed have be , although i do not recall having encounter his name either in the records or the literature . 
perhaps he has only forget a great_deal . 
the book carry a disclaimer in_which remarque say it has be necessary for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures and formalities of racing . 
the necessity be not clear to me , and , in_any_case , to present a case-hardened race-driver as say he has leave his car , which , or whom , he call `` giuseppe '' , park `` on the place_vendome sneer at a dozen bentleys and rolls-royces park around him '' be not a liberty ; it be an absurdity . 
but it be in the_matter of preoccupation with death , which be the primary concern of the book , that remarque 's failure be plainest . 
clerfayt be neurotic , preoccupied , and passive . 
to be human , he believe , is to seek one 's own destruction : the freudian `` death-wish '' cliche inevitably cite whenever laymen talk_about auto race-drivers . 
in_point_of_fact , the race-drivers one know be nearly always intelligent , healthy technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the passion they feel_for the work by which they live . 
a clerfayt may moon_on about the face of death in the cockpit ; a portago could say , as he did say to me , `` if i die tomorrow , still i have have twenty-eight wonderful years ; but i sha n't die tomorrow ; i 'll live to be 105 '' . 
clerfayt , transport , may think_of the engine drive his car as `` a mystical beast under the hood '' . 
the italian master piero_taruffi , no less sensitive , know twice the ecstasy though he think_of a car 's adhesion to a wet two-lane road at 165 miles an hour as a matter best express in algebraic formulae . 
clerfayt , drive , see himself `` a volcano whose cone funnel down to hell '' ; the briton_stirling_moss , one of the greatest virtuosi of_all_time , believe that ultra-fast road-circuit driving be an art_form related_to ballet . 
errors in technical terminology suggest that the over-all translation from the german may not convey quite everything mr._remarque hope to tell us . 
however , my principal objection in_this sort_of novel be to the hackneyed treatment of race-drivers , pilots , submariners , atomic researchers , and all the machine-masters of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists . 
the west be leaderless , accord to this book . 
in contrast , the east is ably lead by such stalwart heroes as khrushchev , tito , and mao . 
against this invincible determination to communize the whole world stand a group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals and each refuse to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common good of all . 
it be field_marshal montgomery 's belief that in most western countries about 60 per_cent of the people do not really care about democracy or christianity ; about 30 per_cent call themselves christians in_order_to keep_up appearances and be consider respectable , and only the last 10 per_cent be genuine christians and believers in democracy . 
but these western countries do care about themselves . 
each feel intensely national . 
if , say , the russians intend to stop tom_jones ' go_to the pub , then tom_jones would fight the commies . 
but he would fight for his own liberty rather_than for any abstract principle connect with_it - such_as `` cause '' . 
for all practical purposes , the west stand disunited , undedicated , and unprepared for the tasks of world leadership . 
with this barrage , montgomery of alamein launch his attack upon the blunderings of the west . 
never give to mince words , he place heavy blame upon the faulty , uncourageous leadership of britain and particularly america . 
at_war 's end leadership in western europe pass from britain because the labour_government devote its attention to the creation of a welfare_state . 
with britain look inward , overseas problems were neglect and the baton was pass_on to the united_states . 
montgomery believe that she start well . 
`` america give generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend and foe alike '' . 
she push wartorn and poverty-stricken nations into prosperity , but she fail to lead them into unity and world peace . 
america has divide more_than she has unite the west . 
the reasons be that america generally believe that she can buy anything with dollars , and that she compulsively strive to be like . 
however , she really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars give_away by a quality of leadership that_is basically need . 
but the greater reason for fumbling , stumbling american leadership be due_to the shock her pride suffer when the japanese attack at pearl_harbor . 
`` they be determined '' , montgomery write , `` not to be surprise again , and now insist on a state of readiness for war which be not_only unnecessary , but also create nervousness among other nations in the western alliance - not_to_mention such great suspicions among the nations of the eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful coexistence or disarmament be not possible '' . 
the net result be that under american leadership the general world situation has become bad . 
to `` monty '' , the american people , who in two previous world_wars be very reluctant to join the fight , `` now look_like the nation most likely to lead us all into a third_world war '' . 
as faulty as has be our leadership clearly the united_states must be rely_on to lead . 
the path to leadership is make clear . 
montgomery call_for a leader who will first put the west 's own house in_order . 
such a man must be able and willing to give clear and sensible advice to the whole group , a person in whom all the member nations will have absolute confidence . 
this leader must be a man who live above illusions that heretofore have shape the foreign_policy of the united_states , namely that russia will agree to a reunite germany , that the east_german government does not exist , that events in japan in june 1960 be communist-inspired , that the true government of china be in formosa , that mao be the evil influence behind khrushchev at the summit_conference in paris in may 1960 , and that either china or russia want or expect war . 
such a leader must strengthen nato politically , and establish that true unity about which it has always talk . 
after drastically overhaul nato , western leadership should turn_to reduce the suspicions that tear_apart the east and west . 
major to this effort is to get all world_powers to withdraw to their own territories , say by 1970 . 
`` the west should make the central proposal ; but the east would have to show sincerity in carry it out '' . 
`` but where be the leader who will handle all these things for us '' ? 
montgomery know all the national_leaders up_to the time of kennedy . 
the man whom he would select as our leader for this great task be de gaulle . 
he alone have the wisdom , the conviction , the tenacity , and the courage to reach a decision . 
but de gaulle is bury in the cause of restore france 's lost soul . 
whoever rises to the occasion walk a treacherous path to leadership . 
the leader montgomery envisage will need to discipline himself , lead a carefully regulated and orderly life , allow time for quiet thought and reflection , adapt decisions and plans to change situations , be ruthless , particularly with inefficiency , and be honest and morally proper . 
all_in_all , montgomery call_for a leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him . 
in look as far back as moses , thence to cromwell , napoleon , lincoln , churchill , and nehru , montgomery attempt to trace the stirrings and qualities of great men . 
he believe that greatness be a marriage between the man and the times as was aptly represent by churchill , who would very possibly have go_down in history as a political failure if it had not be for hitler 's war . 
however , montgomery make little contribution to leadership theory and practice . 
most_of what is say about his great men of history has already been say , and what have not be largely irrelevant to the contemporary scene . 
like eisenhower , he hold the militarist 's suspicion of politicians . 
however , at_the_same_time montgomery select as his hero de gaulle , who be a militarist dominated_by political ambitions . 
`` monty '' show a remarkable capacity for the direct statement and an equally remarkable incapacity for give adequate support . 
for_the_most_part , his writing ramble and jog , prevent easy access by the reader to his true thoughts . 
nevertheless , montgomery has state courageously and wisely the crisis of the western world . 
it suffer from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership . 
and it remain to be see if the new frontier now take_form can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the current shape of events . 
it be no common thing for a listener ( critical or otherwise ) to hear a singer `` live '' for_the_first_time only after he has die . 
but then , mario_lanza be no common singer , and his whole career , public and non-public , was stud with the kind_of unconventional happenings that terminate with the appearance of his first `` recital '' only when he has cease to be a live voice . 
it be a kind_of justice , too , that it should originate_in london 's royal_albert_hall , where , traditionally , the loudest , if_not the greatest , performers have entertain the thousands it will accommodate ( rca_victor_lm 2454 , $ 4.98 ) . 
to_be_sure , lanza make numerous concert tours , here and abroad , but these did not take him to new_york where the carping critic might lurk . 
the reading public , the theatergoing public , the skindiving public , the horse-playing public - all these and_others fill substantial roles in u._s. life , but none be so varied , vast and vigilant as the eat public . 
the department_of_agriculture average_out u._s. food consumption last year at 1488 lbs. per person , which , allow for the 17 million americans that john_kennedy say go_to_bed hungry every_night , mean that certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow down 8 lbs. or more a day . 
that mother hen of the weight-height tables , the metropolitan life_insurance co. , cluck that 48 million americans be overweight . 
through previous centuries , eating change by nearly imperceptible degrees , and mostly toward just get enough . 
now big forces buffet food . 
for_the_first_time in history , the u._s. has produce a society in_which less_than one-tenth of the people turn_out so_much food that the government 's most embarrassing problem be how to dispose_of inconspicuously of 100 million tons of surplus farm produce . 
in_this same society , the plain citizen can with an average of only one-fifth his income buy more calories than he can consume . 
refrigeration , automated processing and packaging conspire to defy season and banish spoilage . 
and in the wake of the new affluence and the new techniques of processing come a new american interest in how what people eat affect their health . 
to eat be human , the nation is learn to think , to survive divine . 
not all the concern for health be well directed . 
from the fusty panaceas of spinach , eggs and prunes , the u._s. has progress_to curds , concentrates and capsules . 
each_year , report the american_medical_association , ten million americans spend $ 900 million on vitamins , tonics and other food supplements . 
at juice bars in los_angeles ' 35 `` health '' stores , a new sensation be a pink , high-protein cocktail , concoct of dried eggs , powdered_milk and cherry-flavored no-cal , which sell for 59 per 8 - oz. glass . 
grocery_stores sell dozens of foods that boast of have almost_no food value at_all . 
but a big part of the public want to know facts about diet and health , and a big group of u._s. scientists want to supply them . 
the man most firmly at grips with the problem be the university of minnesota 's physiologist_ancel_keys , 57 , inventor of the wartime k ( for keys ) ration and author of last year 's bestselling eat_well and stay well . 
from his birch-paneled office in the laboratory of physiological_hygiene , under the university 's football_stadium in minneapolis ( `` we get a rumble on every touchdown '' ) , blocky , grey-haired dr._keys direct an ambitious , $ 200000 - a-year experiment on diet , which span three continents and seven nations and is still grow . 
pursue it , he has log 500000 miles , suffer indescribable digestive indignities , and meticulously collect physiological data on the health and eating habits of 10000 individuals , from bantu tribesmen to italian contadini . 
he has measure the skinfolds ( the fleshy areas under the shoulder_blades ) of neapolitan firemen , study the metabolism of finnish woodcutters , analyze the `` mealie-meal '' eat by capetown coloreds , and experiment on minneapolis businessmen . 
keys 's findings , though far from complete , be likely to smash many_an eating cliche . 
vitamins , eggs and milk begin to look_like foods to hold_down on ( though mothers ' milk be still the ticket ) . 
readings of the number of milligrams of cholesterol in the blood , which seem to have value in predict heart_attacks , are become as routine as the electrocardiogram , which can show that the heart has suffer a symptomatic attack . 
already many_an american know his count , and rejoice or worry depending_on whether it be nearer 180 ( safe ) or 250 ( dangerous ) . 
out of cholesterol come keys 's main messages so_far : 
americans eat too_much . 
the typical u._s. daily menu , say dr._keys , contain 3000 calories , should contain 2300 . 
and extra weight increase the risk of cancer , diabetes , artery disease and heart_attack . 
americans eat too_much fat . 
with meat , milk , butter and ice_cream , the calorie-heavy u._s. diet be 40  fat , and most_of that be saturated fat - the insidious kind , say dr._keys , that increase blood cholesterol , damage arteries , and lead to coronary disease . 
throughout much of the world , food be still so scarce that half of the earth 's population have trouble get the 1600 calories a day necessary to sustain life . 
the deficiency_diseases - scurvy , tropical sprue , pellagra - run rampant . 
in west_africa , for_example , where meat be a luxury and babies must be wean early to make room at the breast for later arrivals , a childhood menace be kwashiorkor , or `` red johnny '' , a growth-stunting protein deficiency ( signs : reddish hair , bloated belly ) that kill more_than half its victims , leave the rest prey for parasites and lingering tropical disease . 
in the well-fed u._s. , deficiency_diseases have virtually vanish in_the_past 20 years . 
today , as harrison 's principles of internal_medicine , a standard internist 's text , put it , `` the_most common form of malnutrition be caloric excess or obesity '' . 
puritan new_england regard obesity as a flagrant symbol of intemperance , and thus a sin . 
say keys : 
`` maybe if the idea get_around again that obesity be immoral , the fat man would start to think '' . 
morals aside , the fat man have plenty to worry about - over and above the fact that no one any longer love him . 
the simple mechanical strain of overweight , say new_york 's dr._norman_jolliffe , can overburden and damage the heart `` for much the same reason that a chevrolet engine in a cadillac body would wear_out sooner than if it be in a body for which it was build '' . 
the fat man have trouble buy life_insurance or has to pay higher premiums . 
he have - for unclear reasons - a 25  higher death_rate from cancer . 
he be particularly vulnerable to diabetes . 
he may find even moderate physical_exertion uncomfortable , because excess body fat hamper his breathing and restrict his muscular movement . 
physiologically , people overeat because what dr._jolliffe call the `` appestat '' is set too high . 
the appestat , which adjust the appetite to keep weight constant , be located , say jolliffe , in the hypothalamus - near the body 's temperature , sleep and water-balance controls . 
physical exercise raise the appestat . 
so does cold_weather . 
in moderate doses , alcohol narcotize the appestat and enhance appetite ( the original reason for the cocktail ) ; but because liquor have a high caloric value - 100 calories per oz. - the heavy drinker be seldom hungry . 
in rare cases , diseases such_as encephalitis or a pituitary tumor may damage the appestat permanently , destroy nearly all sense of satiety . 
far more_frequently , overeating be the result of a psychological compulsion . 
it may be foster by frustration , depression , insecurity - or , in children , simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother 's nagging . 
some families place undue emphasis on food : conversations center_on it , and rich delicacies are offer as rewards , withhold as punishment . 
the result say jolliffe : `` the child gain the feeling that food be the purpose of life '' . 
food may act_as a sedative , give temporary emotional solace , just_as , for some people , alcohol does . 
report dr._keys : `` a fairly common experience for us be the wife who find her husband stay out more_and_more . 
he may be interested in another woman , or just like be with the boys . 
so she fish around in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate_cake . 
it 's a matter of boredom , and the subconscious feeling that she is entitle to something , because she 's being deprive of something else '' . 
for the army of compulsive eaters - from the nibblers and the gobblers to the downright gluttons - reducing be a war with the will that_is rarely win . 
physiologist_keys flatly dismiss such appetite depressants as the amphetamines ( benzedrine , dexedrine ) as dangerous `` crutches for a weak will '' . 
keys have no such objections to metrecal , quaker oats 's quota and other 900 - calorie milk formulas that are currently win favor from dieters . 
`` metrecal be a pretty complete food '' , he say . 
`` it contain large amounts of protein , vitamins and minerals . 
in the quantity of 900 calories a day , anyone will lose_weight on_it - 20 , 30 or 40 lbs . '' . 
but keys worry that the metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological adjustment to the idea of eat smaller portions of food . 
despite his personal distaste for obesity ( `` disgusting '' ) , dr._keys have only an incidental interest in how much americans eat . 
what concern him much more be the relationship of diet to the nation 's no. 1 killer : coronary_artery disease , which account_for more_than half of all heart fatalities and kill 500000 americans a year - twice the toll from all varieties of cancer , five times the deaths from automobile accidents . 
cholesterol , the cornerstone of dr._keys 's theory , be a mysterious yellowish , waxy substance , chemically a crystalline alcohol . 
scientists assume that cholesterol ( from the greek chole , meaning bile , and sterios , meaning solid ) be somehow necessary for the formation of brain_cells , since it account_for about 2  of the brain 's total solid weight . 
they know it be the chief ingredient in gallstones . 
they suspect it play a role in the production of adrenal hormones , and they believe it be essential to the transport of fats throughout the circulatory_system . 
but they cannot fully explain the process of its manufacture by the human liver . 
although the fatty protein_molecules , carry in the blood and partly compose of cholesterol , be water soluble , cholesterol itself be insoluble , and cannot be destroy by the body . 
`` a remarkable substance '' , say dr._keys , `` quite apart from its tendency to be deposit in the walls of arteries '' . 
when thus deposit , keys say that cholesterol be mainly responsible_for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart_attacks . 
explain keys : as the fatty protein_molecules travel in the bloodstream , they are deposit in the intima , or inner wall of a coronary_artery . 
the proteins and fats are burn_off , and the cholesterol is leave behind . 
as cholesterol pile_up , it narrow , irritate and damage the artery , encourage formation of calcium deposits and slow circulation . 
eventually , say keys , one of two things happen . 
a clot form at the site , seal_off the flow of blood to the heart and provoke a heart_attack . 
or ( more commonly , think keys ) the deposits themselves get so big that they choke_off the artery 's flow to_the_point that an infarct occur : the heart_muscle is suffocate , cells supply by the artery die , and the heart is permanently , perhaps fatally injure . 
ordinarily , the human liver synthesize only enough cholesterol to satisfy the body 's needs - for transportation of fats and for production of bile . 
even eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods , eat in normal amounts , say dr._keys , do not materially affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood . 
but fatty foods do . 
during world_war 2 , , doctors in the_netherlands and scandinavia note a curious fact : despite the stresses of nazi occupation , the death_rate from coronary_artery disease was slowly drop . 
not until long after the war - 1950 , in_fact - did they get a hint of the reason . 
that year , sweden 's haqvin_malmros show that the sinking death_rate neatly coincide with increasingly severe restrictions on fatty foods . 
that same year the university of california 's dr._laurance_kinsell , time oxidation rates of blood fats , stumble onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood cholesterol levels to drop radically , while animal_fats cause them to rise . 
here keys and_others , such_as dr._a._e._ahrens of the rockefeller_institute , take_over to demonstrate the chemical difference between vegetable and animal_fats - and even between different varieties of each . 
all natural food fats fall_into one of three categories - saturated , mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated . 
the degree of saturation depend_on the number of hydrogen_atoms on the fat molecule . 
saturated fats can accommodate no_more hydrogens . 
mono-unsaturated fats have room for two more hydrogens on each molecule , and the poly-unsaturated fat molecule have room for at_least four hydrogens . 
the three fats have similar caloric values ( about 265 calories per oz . ) , but each exert a radically different influence on blood cholesterol . 
furthermore , as an encouragement to revisionist thinking , it manifestly be fair to admit that any fraternity have a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislike . 
the unitarian clergy be an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen - as the term was then understand in_the_back bay - and parker be definitely not a gentleman , either in theology or in manners . 
ezra_stiles_gannett , an honorable representative of the sanhedrin , address himself frankly to the issue in 1845 , insist that parker should not be persecute or calumniate and that in_this republic no power to restrain him by force could exist . 
even_so , gannett judiciously argue , the association could legitimately decide that parker `` should not be encourage nor assist in diffuse his opinions by those who differ from him in regard_to their correctness '' . 
we today be not entitled to excoriate honest men who believe parker to be downright pernicious and who bar their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations . 
one can even argue - though this be a delicate matter - that every justification exist for their return the public_lecture to the first_church , and so to suppress it , rather_than let parker use it as a sounding_board for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy it . 
finally , it did seem clear as day to these clergymen , as gannett 's son explain in the biography of his father , they had always contend for the propriety of their claim to the title of christians . 
their demand against the calvinist_orthodoxy for intellectual liberty had never mean that they would follow `` free inquiry '' to the extreme of proclaim christianity a `` natural '' religion . 
grant all this - still , when modern unitarianism and the harvard_divinity_school recall with humorous affection the insults parker lavish upon them , or_else argue that after_all parker receive the treatment he invite , they betray an uneasy conscience . 
whenever new_england liberalism is remind of the dramatic confrontation of parker and the fraternity on january 23 , 1843 - while it may defend the privilege of chandler_robbins to demand that parker leave the association , while it may plead that dr._n._l._frothingham have every warrant for state , `` the difference between trinitarians and unitarians be a difference in christianity ; the difference between mr._parker and the association be a difference between no christianity and christianity '' - despite these supposed conclusive assurances , the modern liberal heave repeatedly a sigh of relief , of positive thanksgiving , that the association never quite bring_oneself itself officially to expel parker . 
had it done so , the blot on its escutcheon would have remain indelible , nor could the harvard_divinity_school assemble today to honor parker 's insurgence other_than by get_down on its collective knees and cry `` peccavi '' . 
happily for posterity , then , the boston_association did not actually command parker to leave the room , though it come too_close for comfort to what would have be an unforgivable brutality . 
fortunately , the honor of the denomination can attest that cyrus_bartol defend parker 's sincerity , as did also gannett and chandler_robbins ; whereupon parker break_down into convulsions of weeping and rush out of the room , though not out of the fellowship . 
in the hall , after adjournment , dr._frothingham take him warmly by the hand and request parker to visit him - whereupon our burly theodore again burst into tears . 
all this near tragedy , which to us border_on comedy , enable us to tell the story over_and_over_again , always warm ourselves with a glow of complacency . 
it be indeed a near thing , but somehow the inherent decency of new_england ( which we inherit ) did triumph . 
parker was never excommunicate . 
to the extent that he was ostracize or even revile , we solace ourselves by say he ask_for it . 
yet , even after_all these stratagems , the conscience of christian liberality is still not lay_to_rest , any_more than is the conscience of harvard_university for having do the abject penance for its rejection of ralph_waldo_emerson 's the divinity_school_address of name its hall of philosophy after him . 
in both cases the stubborn fact remain : liberalism give_birth to two brilliant apostates , both legitimate offspring of its loins , and when bring to the test , it behave shabbily . 
suppose they both had venture into realms which their colleagues think infidel : 
be this the way gentlemen settle frank differences_of_opinion ? 
be it after_all possible that no_matter_how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity they are expose to a contagion of fear more insidious than any conservative has ever to worry about ? 
however , there be a crucial difference between the two histories . 
emerson evade the problem by shove it aside , or rather by leave_behind it behind him : he walk_out_of the unitarian communion , so_that it could lick the wound of his departure , preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious veneration . 
parker insist upon not resign , even when the majority want him to depart , upon dare the fellowship to throw_out him out . 
hence he be in his lifetime , as be the memory of him afterwards , a canker within the liberal sensitivity . 
he still point an accusing finger at_all of us , tell us we have neither the courage to support him nor the energy to cut his throat . 
actually , the dispute between parker and the society of his time , both ecclesiastical and social , be a real one , a bitter one . 
it cannot be smooth_over by now cherish his sarcasms as delightful bits of self-deprecation or by solemnly call_for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections to him . 
the fact be incontestable : that liberal world of unitarian_boston be narrow-minded , intellectually sterile , smug , afraid_of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm , and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle foundations were threaten . 
parker , along with garrison and charles_sumner , show a magnificent moral bravery when face mobs mobilize in defense of the mexican war and slavery . 
nevertheless , we can find reasons for respect even the bigotry of the populace ; their passions be genuine , and the division between them and the abolitionists be clear-cut . 
but parker as the ultra-liberal minister within the pale of a church which had proclaim itself the repository of liberality pose a different problem , which be not to be resolve by hold_up him up as the champion of freedom . 
even_though his theological theses have become , to us , commonplaces , the fundamental interrogation he phrase be very_much with us . 
it has been endlessly rephrase , but i may here put it thus : at what point do the tolerant find themselves oblige to become intolerant ? 
and_then , as they become aware that they have reach the end of their patience , what do they , to their dismay , learn for_the_first_time about themselves ? 
there can be no_doubt , the boston of_that era could be exquisitely cruel in enforce its canons of behavior . 
the gentle channing , revere by all bostonians , orthodox or unitarian , write to a friend in louisville that among its many virtues boston did not abound_in a tolerant spirit , that the yoke of opinion crush individuality of judgment and action : `` no city in the world is govern so little by a police , and so_much by mutual inspections and what is call public sentiment . 
we stand more in_awe_of one another than most people . 
opinion be less individual or run more into masses , and often rule with a rod of iron '' . 
even more poignantly , and with the insight of a genius , channing add - remember , this be channing , not parker ! 
- that should a minister in boston trust himself to his heart , should he `` speak without book , and consequently break some law of speech , or be hurry into some daring hyperbole , he should find little mercy '' . 
channing write this - in a letter ! 
i think it fair to say that he never quite reach such candor in his sermons . 
but theodore_parker , commence his mission to the world-at-large , disguised as the minister of a `` twenty-eighth congregational_church '' which bear no resemblance to the congregational polities descend from the founders ( among which be still the unitarian churches ) , make explicit from_the_beginning that the conflict between him and the hunkerish society be not something which could be evaporate into a genteel difference about clerical decorum . 
because he speak openly with what channing had prophesy someone might - with daring hyperbole - parker vindicate channing 's further prophecy that he who commit this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals be disposed to allow to libertarians who appear to them libertines . 
an institutionalized liberalism prove itself fundamentally an institution , and only within those defined limits a license . 
by remind ourselves of these factors in the situation , we should , i be sure , come_to a fresh realization , however painful it be , that the battle between parker and his neighbors was fight in_earnest . 
he arraign the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they have to respond with , at_the_least , resentment . 
what otherwise could `` the lawyer , doctor , minister , the men_of_science and letters '' do when tell that they had `` become the cherubim and seraphim and the three archangels who stand before the golden throne of the merchant , and continually cry , ' holy , holy , holy be the almighty dollar '' ' ? 
nor , when we recollect how sensitive be the emotions of the old puritan stock in regard_to the recent tides of immigration , should we be astonished that their thin lips be compressed into a white_line of rage as parker snarl at them thus : `` talk_about the catholics vote as the bishop tell ! 
reproach the catholics for it ! 
you and i do the same thing . 
there be a great many bishops who have never have a cross on their bosom , nor a mitre on their head , who appeal not to the authority of the pope at rome , but to the almighty dollar , a pope much nearer home . 
boston has been control by a_few capitalists , lawyers and other managers , who tell the editors what to say and the preachers what to think '' . 
this be war . 
parker meant_business . 
and he take_care repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intend them : `` even the unitarian churches have catch the malaria , and be worse than those who deceive them '' - which imply that they be very bad indeed . 
it be `` duty '' he say that his parents had give him as a rule - beyond even the love that suffuse his being and the sense_of_humor with which he was largely supply - and it be duty he would perform , though it cost him acute pain and exhaust him by the age of fifty . 
parker could weep - and he weep astonishingly often and on the slightest provocation - but the psychology of those tears be entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to massacre his opponents . 
`` if it give me pleasure to say hard things '' , he write , `` i would shut_up forever '' . 
we have to tell ourselves that when parker speak in_this vein , he believe what he say , because he could continue , `` but the truth , which cost me bitter tears to say , i must speak , though it cost other tears hotter than fire '' . 
because he copiously shed his own tears , and yield_up himself up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of new_england , he was not disturb by the havoc he work in other people 's consciences . 
our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how strenuous be the fight is muffle by our indifference to the very issue which in the boston of 1848 seem to be the central hope of its christian survival , that of the literal , factual historicity of the miracles as report in the four gospels . 
it be idle to ask why we are no_longer disturb if somebody , profess the deepest piety , decide anew that it be of no importance whether or not christ transform the water into wine at eleven a._m. on the third of august , a._d. 32 . 
we have no answer as to why we are not alarm . 
so we be the more prepared to give parker the credit for having take the right side in an unnecessary controversy , to salute his courage , and to pass_on , happily forget both him and the entire episode . 
we have not the leisure , or the patience , or the skill , to comprehend what was work in_the_mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the harvard_divinity_school who would muster the audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor , the majesterial andrews_norton , by say that , while he believe jesus `` like other religious teachers '' , work miracles , `` i see not how a miracle prove a doctrine '' . 
i have , within the past fifty years , come_out of all uncertainty into a faith which be a dominating conviction of the truth and about which i have not a shadow of doubt . 
it has be my lot all through life to associate with eminent scientists and at_times to discuss with them the deepest and most vital of all questions , the nature of the hope of a life beyond this . 
i have also constantly engage in scientific work and be fully aware_of the value of opinions form in science as_well as in the religions in the world . 
n an amateu6rish , yet in a very real sense , i have follow the developments of archaeology , geology , astronomy , herpetology , and mycology with a hearty appreciation of the advances being make in these fields . 
at_one_time i become disturbed in the faith in_which i had grow_up by the apparent inroads being make upon both old and new_testaments by a `` higher_criticism '' of the bible , to refute which i feel the need of a better knowledge of hebrew and of archaeology , for it seem to me that to pull_out some of the props of our faith be to weaken the entire structure . 
doubts thus inculcate leave me flounder for_a_while and , like some higher critical friends , try to continue to use the bible as the word_of_god while at_the_same_time hold it to have been subject to a vast number of redactions and interpolations : 
attempt to bridge the chasm between an older , reverent , bible-loving generation and a critical , doubting , bible-emancipated race . 
although still aware_of a great light and glow of warmth in the book , i stand outside shiver in the cold . 
in one thing the higher critics , like the modernists , however , overreach themselves , in claim that the gospel of john was not write in john 's time but well after the first century , perhaps as late as 150 a._d. . 
now , if any part of the bible be assuredly the very word_of_god speak through his servant , it be john 's gospel . 
to ask me to believe that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was write long after_all the events by some admiring follower , and was not inspire directly by the spirit of god , is ask me to accept a miracle far greater than any of those record in the bible . 
here i take_leave my leave of my learned friends to step out on another path , to_which we might give the modern name of pragmatism , or the thing that work . 
test it , try it , and if it work , accept it as a guiding principle . 
so , i put my bible to the practical test of note what it say about itself , and_then test it to see how it work . 
as a short , possibly not the best method , i look_up `` word '' in the concordance and note that the bible claim from genesis 1 to revelation 22 to be god 's personal message to man . 
the next traditional step then be to accept it as the authoritative textbook of the christian faith just_as one would accept a treatise on any earthly `` science '' , and i submit to its conditions accord to christ 's invitation and promise that , `` if any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of god , or whether i speak of myself '' ( john 7 : 17 ) . 
the outcome of such an experiment has be in_due_time the acceptance of the bible as the word_of_god inspire in_a_sense utterly different from any merely human book , and with_it the acceptance of our lord jesus_christ as the only begotten son of god , son of man by the_virgin mary , the saviour of the world . 
i believe , therefore , that we be without exception sinners , by nature alienate from god , and that jesus_christ , the son of god , come to earth , the representative head of a new race , to die upon the cross and pay the penalty of the sin of the world , and that he who thus receive christ as his personal saviour is `` bear again '' spiritually , with new privileges , appetites , and affections , destine to live and grow in his likeness forever . 
nor can any man save himself by good works or by a commendable `` moral life '' , although such works be the natural fruits and evidences of a saving faith already receive and naturally express itself through such avenues . 
i now ever look_for christ acording to his promises and those of the old_testament as_well , to appear again in glory to put_away all sin and to reign in righteousness over the whole earth . 
to state fully what the bible mean as my daily spiritual food be as intimate and difficult as to formulate the reasons for love my nearest and dearest relatives and friends . 
the bible be as obviously and truly food for the spirit as bread be food for the body . 
again , as faith reveal god my father and christ my saviour , i follow without question where he lead me daily by his spirit of love , wisdom , power and prayer . 
i place his precepts and his leadings above every seeming probability , dismiss cherished convictions and hold the wisdom of man as folly when oppose to him . 
i discern no limits to a faith vest in god and christ , who be the sum of all wisdom and knowledge , and dare to trust him even_though call to stand alone before the world . 
our lord 's invitation with its implied promise to all be , `` come and see '' . 
i stand at the bedside of my patient one_day and behold a very sick man in terrible pain . 
as i minister to his needs , i notice that his face be radiant in_spite_of his suffering and i learn that he was trust not_only in the skill of his doctor and nurse but also the lord . 
in his heart he have that peace of_which the lord speak when he say , `` peace i leave with you , my peace i give unto you : not as the world giveth , give i unto you . 
let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid '' . 
what a joy to realize that we , too , can claim this promise tender by the lord during his earthly ministry to a group of men who be very dear to him . 
he be about to leave them , to depart from this world , and return to his father in heaven . 
before he leave them he promise that his peace would be their portion to abide in their hearts and minds . 
i praise god for the privilege of be a nurse who have that peace through faith in the lord jesus_christ . 
it make my work a great_deal easier to be able to pray for the lord 's guidance while minister to the physical needs of my patients . 
how often have i look_to jesus when enter the sick room , ask for his presence and help in my professional duties as i give my talents not_only as the world giveth but as one who love the saviour and his creatures . 
looking unto god , the prophet_isaiah write these blessed words almost three thousand years ago : `` thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind be stay on thee : because he trusteth in thee '' . 
are you long for peace in your heart ? 
such a calm and assuring peace can be yours . 
as only a member of the family can share_in the innermost joys of the family , likewise one must belong_to the family of god in_order_to receive the benefits that are promise to those who be his own . 
perhaps you be not his child . 
perhaps you do not know if you belong to him . 
you may know that you be in god 's family and be just_as sure of_it as you be that you belong_to the family of your earthly father . 
`` god so love the world , that he give his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life '' , and `` as_many as receive him , to them give he power to become the sons of god , even to them that believe on his name '' . 
it be to those who believe on his name and belong to him that he give his peace ; not that empty peace the world offer , but a deep , abiding peace which nothing can destroy . 
why not open your heart to the lord jesus_christ now , accept him as your saviour and let him fill you with peace that only he can give . 
then , with the hymn writer of old , you can say : 
`` i am rest today in his wonderful peace , 
rest sweetly in jesus ' control . 
i am keep from all danger by night and by day , 
and his glory is flood my soul `` . 
satellites , sputniks , rockets , balloons ; what next ? 
our necks be stiff from gaze at the wonders of outer_space , which have capture the imagination of the american public . 
cape_canaveral 's achievements thunder forth from the radio , television , and newspaper . 
while we are fill outer_space with scientific successes , for many the `` inner '' space of their soul be an aching void . 
proof ? 
an average of 50 suicides are report in america each_day ! 
one out of every three or four marriages end in divorce ! 
over $ 200000000 is pay yearly to the 80000 full-time fortune-tellers in the united_states by fearful mankind who want to `` know '' what the future hold ! 
delinquency , juvenile and adult , be at an all-time high ! 
further proof ? 
read your daily newspaper ! 
unfortunately , in our rush to beat the russians , we have forget these truth-packed words of jesus_christ : `` what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world [ that include outer_space ] , and lose his own soul ? 
or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul '' ? 
( mark 8 : 36 , 37 ) . 
gain outer_space and lose `` inner '' space be bad business accord to god 's standards . 
it be true that we must keep_up our national defenses and scientific accomplishments ; only a fool would think otherwise . 
but we must_not forget man 's soul . 
be put a rocket in orbit half so significant as the good news that god put his son , jesus_christ , on earth to live and die to save our hell-bound souls ? 
`` for god so love the world , that he give his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life '' ( john 3 : 16 ) . 
never forget that a chain be only as strong as its weakest link . 
your spiritual `` inner '' space help determine the spirituality of america as a nation . 
we trust you be not_one of the 70000000 americans who do not attend church , but who feel that various forms of recreation be more important than worship the god who make our country great . 
be forgiveness of past sins , assurance of present help , and hope of future bliss in your orbit ? 
or are you try the_devil 's substitutes to relieve that spiritual hunger you feel within ? 
pleasure , fame and fortune , drown your troubles with a drink , and `` live_it_up '' with the gang be like candy_bars when you be hungry : they may ease your hunger temporarily , but they 'll never take the place of a satisfying , mouth-watering steak . 
so it be spiritually . 
no amount of religious_ceremonies or even join a church will relieve the gnawing of your `` inner '' space . 
why ? 
because your soul was make to be fill with god himself , not religious functions `` about '' him . 
only he can satisfy the deepest longings . 
that be why the bible command you to `` taste and see that the lord be good : blessed [ happy ] be the man that trusteth in him '' ( psalm 34 : 8 ) . 
you can receive god into your heart and life by a step of personal faith . 
accept the sinless son of god , jesus_christ , as your own personal saviour . 
`` the lord be my light and my salvation ; whom shall i fear ? 
the lord be the strength of my life ; of whom shall i be afraid '' ? 
psalm 27 : 1 a certain teacher schedule a `` fear party '' for her fourth grade pupils . 
it be a session at which all the youngsters were tell to express their fears , to get them out in_the_open where they could talk_about them freely . 
the teacher think it be so successful that she ask : `` would n't it be helpful to all age_groups if they could participate in a similar confessional of their fears and worries '' ? 
dr._george_w._crane , a medical columnist , think it would . 
he say : `` that would reduce neurotic ailments tremendously . 
each_week an estimated 20 million patients call_upon us doctors . 
of_this number , 50  , or 10 million patients have no diagnosable physical ailments whatever . 
they be ' worry_warts ' . 
yet they keep run from one physician to another , largely to get a willing ear who will listen to their parade of troubles . 
one of the_most wholesome things you could schedule in your church would thus be a group confessional where people could admit of their inner tensions '' . 
we are evidently try hard to think_of new ways to deal with the problem of fear these days . 
it must be get more serious . 
people are give their doctors a hard_time . 
one doctor make a careful survey of his patients and the reasons for their troubles , and he report that 40  of them worry about things that never happen ; 30  of them worry about past happenings which be completely beyond their control ; 12  of them worry about their health , although their ailments be imaginary ; 10  of them worry about their friends , neighbors , and relatives , most_of whom be quite capable_of take care of themselves . 
only 8  of the worries have behind them real causes which demand attention . 
well , most_of our fears may be unfounded , but after you discover that fact , you have something else to worry about : why then do we have these fears ? 
what be the real cause of them ? 
what is there about us that make us so anxious ? 
look_at the things we do to escape our fears and to forget our worries . 
we spend millions of dollars every_year on fortune_tellers and soothsayers . 
we spend billions of dollars at the race tracks , and more billions on other forms of gambling . 
we spend billions of dollars on liquor , and many_more billions on various forms of escapist entertainment . 
we consume tons of aspirin and tranquilizers and sleeping_pills in_order_to get a moment 's relief from the tensions that are tear us apart . 
a visitor from a more peaceful country across the sea was take to one of our amusement_parks , and after he had see it all , he say to a friend : `` you must be a very sad people '' . 
`` sad '' be not the right word , of_course . 
he should have say `` jittery '' , for that be what we be . 
and that be worse than sad . 
watch people flock to amusement houses , cocktail_lounges , and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment , which mean an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who be supposed to perform in those incredible ways which are design to give men a_few hours of dubious relaxation - watch them and you can tell that many_of them are run_away from something . 
in one of his writings pascal speak of_this mania for diversion as be a sign of misery and fear which man cannot endure without such opiates . 
yes , and as tension mount in_this world , fear is increase . 
does that explain why there be now such a big boom in the bomb_shelter business ? 
we have so many new things to fear in_this age of nuclear_weapons , dreadful things which be too horrible to contemplate . 
i doubt that `` fear parties '' and `` group confessionals '' will help very_much . 
suppose we do get our fears out in_the_open , what then ? 
is n't that where most_of them be already - right out on the front page of our newspapers ? 
maybe we are talk_about them too_much . 
the question be : 
what are we go to do about them ? 
meanwhile , the enemy will capitalize on our fears , if he can . 
hitler do just that 23 years ago , build_up tensions that first lead to a munich and_then to a world_war . 
the fear of war can make us either too weak to stand and too willing to compromise , or too reckless and too nervous to negotiate for peace as long as there be any chance to negotiate . 
it is say that fear in human_beings produce an odor that provoke animals to attack . 
it could have the same effect on communists . 
the president_of_the_united_states has say : `` we will never negotiate out of fear , and we will never fear to negotiate '' . 
that be a sound position , but it be important that moscow shall recognize it not merely as the word of a president but as the mind of a free people who be not afraid . 
and that be another reason why it be imperative for us these days to conquer our fears , to develop the poise that promote peace . 
turn_to the word_of_god , we find the only sure way to do that . 
in psalm 27 : 1 you read those beautiful words which you must have in your heart if you are to master the fears that surround you , or to drive them out if they have you in their grip : `` the lord be my light and my salvation ; whom shall i fear ? 
the lord be the strength of my life ; of whom shall i be afraid '' ? 
well , you say , those be beautiful words all_right , but it be easy for the psalmist to sing them in his day . 
he did n't live in a world of perpetual peril like ours . 
he did n't know anything about the problems we face today . 
no ? 
read the next two verses : `` when the wicked , even mine enemies and my foes , come upon me to eat_up my flesh , they stumble and fall . 
though an host should encamp against me , my heart shall not fear : 
though war should rise against me , in_this will i be confident '' . 
that_is almost a perfect description of the predicament in_which we find ourselves today , is n't it ? 
our enemy is also threaten to devour us . 
he has already devoured huge areas of the world , put men behind concrete walls and iron_curtains and barbed_wire , reduce them to slavery , systematically crush not_only their bodies but their souls , and shoot them to death if they try to escape their prison . 
yes indeed , we too can see a warlike host of infidels encamp against us . 
what a terrible thing , that `` wailing_wall '' in berlin ! 
a man with a baby in his arms stand there plead for his wife who be on the other side with the rest of the family . 
another man try to swim across the river from the east to the west , but was shoot and kill . 
a middle aged woman open a window on the third floor of her house which be behind the wall , she throw_out a_few belongings and_then jump ; she was fatally injure . 
the entrance to a church has been wall_up , so_that the congregation , most_of which be in the western sector , cannot worship god there anymore . 
practically everybody in berlin have relatives and friends that live in the opposite part of the city . 
people stand at the wall give_vent to their feelings , weep , pound it with their fists , plead for loved_ones . 
but the enemy answer them from loudspeakers that pour out communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible profanity . 
there be only one escape left , a tragic one , and too many people are take it : suicide . 
the normal rate of suicides in east_berlin be one a day , but since the border was close on august 13 it has jump to 25 a day ! 
these things may be happen many miles away from us but really they be right next_door . 
we be all involved in them , deeply involved . 
and nobody know what come next . 
we live from crisis to crisis . 
and there be only one way for a man to conquer his fears in such a world . 
he must learn to say with true faith what the psalmist say in a similar world : `` the lord be my light and my salvation ; whom shall i fear ? 
the lord be the strength of my life ; of whom shall i be afraid '' ? 
notice that this man have a threefold conception of god which be the secret of his faith . 
first , `` the lord be my light '' . 
he live in a very dark world , but he be not in the dark . 
the same god who call this world into being when he say : `` let there be light '' ! 
- those be his very first creative words - he begin the world with light - this god still give light to a world which man has plunge into darkness . 
for those who put their trust in him he still say every_day again : `` let there be light '' ! 
and there be light ! 
in_fact , he come into this world himself , in the person of his son , jesus_christ , who stand here amid the darkness of human sin and say : `` i be the light of the world : he that followeth me shall not walk in_darkness , but shall have the light of life '' . 
the psalmist could say that god be his light even_though he could only anticipate the coming of christ . 
he live in the dawn ; he could only see the light come over the horizon . 
we live in the bright daylight of_that great event ; for us it be a fact in history . 
why should we not have the same faith , and an even greater experience of the light which it give ? 
this be the faith that move the psalmist to add his second conception of god : `` the lord be my salvation '' . 
he know that his god would save him from his enemies because he had save him from his sins . 
if god could do that , he could do anything . 
the enemies at his gate , threaten to eat_up his flesh , be nothing compare with the enemy of sin within his own soul . 
and god had conquer that one by his grace ! 
so why worry about all the others ? 
the apostle paul say the same thing in the language and faith of the new_testament : `` he that spare not his own son , but deliver him up for us all , how shall he not with him freely give us all things ? 
if god be for us , who can be against us ? 
who shall separate us from the love of christ ? 
shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword '' ? 
( romans 8 : 31 , 32 , 35 ) 
salvation ! 
this be the key to the conquest of fear . 
this get down to the heart of our problem , for it reconcile us with god , whom we fear most_of_all because we have sin against him . 
when that fear has been remove by faith in jesus_christ , when we know that he be our savior , that he has pay our debt with his blood , that he has meet the demands of god 's justice and thus has turn his wrath away - when we know that , we have peace with god in our hearts ; and_then , with this god on our side , we can face the whole world without_fear . 
and so the psalmist give us one more picture of god : `` the lord be the strength of my life '' . 
the word be really `` stronghold '' . 
it recall those words of another psalm : `` god be our refuge and strength , a very present help in_trouble . 
therefore will not we fear , though the earth be remove , and though the mountains be carry into the midst of the sea . 
come , behold the works of the lord , what desolations he hath make in the earth . 
but , again , we have no real evidence on this from_that quarter until the close of the ninth century a._d. , when an arabic scholar , tabit ibn korra ( 836 - 901 ) is say to have discuss the magic square of three . 
thus , while it remain possible that the babylonians and / or the pythagoreans may perhaps have have the magic square of three before the chinese did , more definite evidence will have to turn_up from the middle_east or the classical_world before china can lose her claim to the earliest known magic square by more_than a_thousand years . 
the concept of the middle_kingdom at_peace , strong and united under a forceful ruler , which had be only a longed-for ideal in the time of the warring states , was finally realize by the establishment of a chinese empire under the ch ' in dynasty ( 221 - 207 b. c . ) . 
but this was only accomplish by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian despotism . 
among the many severe measures take by the first_emperor , shih_huang-ti , in his efforts to insure the continuation of_this hard-won national unity , be the burning of the books in 213 b._c. , with the expressed intention of remove possible sources for divergent thinking ; but , as he have a special fondness for magic and divination , he order that books on these subjects should be spare . 
many_of the latter were destroy in their turn , during the burning of the vast ch ' in palace some ten years later ; yet some must have survive , because the old interest in number symbolism , divination , and magic persist on into the han dynasty , which succeed in reunite china and keep it together for a longer period ( from 202 b._c. to a._d. 220 ) . 
in_fact , during the first century b._c. , an extensive literature spring_up devoted_to these subjects , find its typical expression in the so-called `` wei books '' , a_number_of which were specifically devoted_to the lo_shu and related numerical diagrams , especially in connection with divination . 
however , the wei books were also destroy in_a_series of orthodox_confucian purges which culminate in a final proscription in 605 . 
after_all this destruction of old literature , it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the lo_shu , which be already semisecret anyhow . 
but , in_spite_of all this , enough evidence remain to show that the magic square of three must indeed have be the object of a rather extensive cult - or series of cults - reach fullest expression in the han period . 
although modern scholars have express surprise that `` the simple magic square of three '' , a mere `` mathematical puzzle '' , be able_to exert a considerable influence on the minds and imaginations of the cultured chinese for so many centuries , they could have find most_of the answers right within the square itself . 
but , up_to_now , no one has attempt to analyze its inherent mathematical properties , or the numerical significance of its numbers - singly or in combination - and_then try to consider these in the light of old chinese cosmological concepts . 
such an analysis speedily reveal why the middle number of the lo_shu , 5 , be so vitally significant for the chinese ever since the earliest hints that they have a knowledge of_this diagram . 
the importance of_this 5 can largely be explain by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers - quite apart from any numerological considerations , which be to say , any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assign to it . 
indeed , mathematically speak , it be both functionally and symbolically the_most important number in the entire diagram . 
if one take the middle number , 5 , and multiply it by 3 ( the base number of the magic square of three ) , the result be 15 , which be also the constant sum of all the rows , columns , and two main diagonals . 
then , if the middle number is activate to its greatest potential in_terms_of this square , through multiply it by the highest number , 9 ( which be the square of the base number ) , the result be 45 ; and the latter be the total sum of all the numbers in the square , by which all the other numbers are overshadow and in_which they may be say to be absorb . 
furthermore , the middle number of the lo_shu be not_only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers , by reason of its central position ; it be also their mathematical mean , since it be equal to half the sum of every opposing pair , all_of which equal 10 . 
in_fact , the neat balance of these pairs , and their subtle equilibrium , would have have special meaning in the minds of the old chinese . 
for they consider the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female , equate the two groups with the yang and yin principles in nature ; and in_this square , the respective pairs make_up of large and small odd ( yang ) numbers , and those compose of large and small even ( yin ) numbers , be all equal_to each other . 
thus all differences were level , and all contrasts erase , in a realm of no distinction , and the harmonious balance of the lo_shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis . 
the tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the lo_shu square - for purely mathematical reasons - and the fact that this number so neatly symbolize the heart and center of the universe , could well explain why the old chinese seem to have so revere the number 5 , and why they put so_much stress on the concept of centrality . 
these twin tendencies seem to have reach their height in the han dynasty . 
the existing reverence for centrality must have been still further stimulate toward the close of the second century b._c. , when the han_emperor_wu_ti order the dynastic color change to yellow - which symbolize the center among the traditional five directions - and take 5 as the dynastic number , believe that he would thus place himself , his imperial family , and the nation under the_most auspicious influences . 
his immediate motive for do this may not have been directly inspire by the lo_shu , but this measure must inevitably have increase the existing beliefs in the latter 's efficacy . 
after this time , inscriptions on the han bronze mirrors , as_well as other writings , emphasize the desirability of keep one 's self at the center of the universe , where cosmic forces be strongest . 
later , we shall see what happen when an emperor take this idea too literally . 
all this emphasis on centrality and on the number 5 as a symbolic expression of the center , which seem to have begin as far back as 400 b._c. , also may conceivably have lead to the development of the five-elements_school and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical categories of five . 
we find , for_example , such groupings as the five ancient rulers , the five sacred mountains , the five directions ( with center ) , the five metals , five colors , five tastes , five odors , five musical_notes , five bodily_functions , five viscera , and many others . 
this trend has often been ascribe to the cult of the five elements itself , as though they had serve as the base for all the rest ; but why did the old chinese postulate five elements , when the ancient near east - which may have initiate the idea that natural elements exert influence in human life and activities - recognize only four ? 
and why did the chinese suddenly begin to talk_about the five directions , when the animals they use as symbols of the directions designate only the usual four ? 
obviously , something suddenly cause them to start think in_terms_of fives , and that may have be the workings of the lo_shu . 
this whole tendency have an unfortunate effect on chinese thinking . 
whereas the primary meanings of the lo_shu diagram seem to have been base on its inner mathematical properties - and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rest_on some mathematical bases - the urgent desire to place everything into categories of fives lead to other groupings base on other numbers , until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervade chinese thought . 
scholars make numbered sets of as_many things as possible in nature , or assign arbitrary numbers to individual things , in a fashion that seem to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical , and philosophical ideas base upon all this tend to stifle speculative thought in china for many centuries . 
although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the lo_shu , and the interrelation of all the other numbers to_it , might seem enough to account_for the deep fascination which the lo_shu hold for the old chinese philosophers , this be actually only a beginning of wonders . 
for the lo_shu square be a remarkably complete compendium of most_of the chief religious and philosophical ideas of its time . 
as_such , one cannot fully understand the thought of the pre-han and han periods without know the meanings inherent in the lo_shu ; but , conversely , one cannot begin to understand the lo_shu without know something about the world_view of the old chinese , which they feel they see express in it . 
the chinese world_view during the han dynasty , when the lo_shu seem to have be at the height of its popularity , was base in large part on the teachings of the yin-yang and five-elements_school , which was traditionally found by tsou_yen . 
accord to this doctrine , the universe was rule by heaven , t ' ien - as a natural force , or in the personification of a supreme_sky-god - govern all things by means of a process called the tao , which can be roughly interpret as `` the order of the universe '' or `` the universal way '' . 
heaven , act through the tao , express itself by means of the workings of two basic_principles , the yin and the yang . 
the yang , or male principle , be the source of light , heat , and dynamic vitality , associated with the sun ; while the yin , or female principle , flourish in_darkness , cold , and quiet inactivity , and was associated with the moon . 
together these two principles influence all things , and in varying combinations they be present in everything . 
we have already see that odd numbers were consider as be yang , while the even numbers be yin , so_that the eight outer numbers of the lo_shu represent these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center . 
during the han dynasty , another yin-yang conception was apply to the lo_shu , consider the latter as a plan of ancient_china . 
instead of link the nine numbers of_this diagram with the traditional nine provinces , as was usually do , this equate the odd , yang numbers with mountains ( firm and resistant , hence yang ) and the even numbers with rivers ( sinuous and yielding , hence yin ) ; take the former from the five sacred mountains of the han period and the latter from the principal river systems of old_china . 
thus the middle number , 5 , represent sung-shan in honan , central_china ; the 3 , t ' ai-shan in shantung , east_china ; the 7 , hwa-shan in shensi , west_china ; the 1 , heng-shan in hopei , north_china ( or the mountain with the same name in neighboring shansi ) ; and the 9 , huo-shan in anhwei , which be then the south_sacred_mountain . 
for the rivers , the 4 represent the huai , to the ( then ) southeast ; the 2 , the san_kiang ( three rivers ) in the ( then ) southwest ; the 8 , the chi in the northeast ; and the 6 , the ( upper ) yellow_river in the northwest . 
note that by western standards this plan be `` upside_down '' , as it put north at the bottom and south at the top , with the other directions correspondingly alter ; but in_this respect it was merely follow the accepted chinese convention for all maps . 
the same arrangement was use when the lo_shu was equate with the nine provinces ; and whenever the lo_shu involve directional symbolism , it was orient in_this same fashion . 
few persons who join the church be insincere . 
they earnestly desire to do the will of god . 
when they fall_by_the_wayside and fail to achieve christian stature , it be an indictment of the church . 
these fatalities be dramatic evidence of `` halfway evangelism '' , a failure to follow_through . 
a program of lay_visitation_evangelism can end in dismal defeat with half the new members drift away unless practical plans and strenuous efforts are make to keep them in the active fellowship . 
the work of lay_visitation_evangelism is not complete when all_of the persons on the responsibility_list have been interview . 
in the average situation about one-third of those visit make commitments to christ and the church . 
the pastor and the membership preparation and assimilation_committee must follow_through immediately with a carefully planned program . 
the first thirty to sixty days after individuals make their decision will determine their interest and participation in the life of the church . 
neglect mean spiritual paralysis or death . 
churches that have a carefully planned program of membership preparation and assimilation often keep 85 to 90 per_cent of their new members loyal and active . 
this be the answer to the problem of `` membership delinquency '' . 
it is important that persons desire to unite with the church be prepare_for this experience so_that it may be meaningful and spiritually significant . 
it be unfair and unchristian to ask a person to take the sacred vows of church membership before he has been carefully instruct concerning their implications . 
preparation for church membership begin immediately after the commitment is_received . 
the pastor write a personal_letter to each individual , express his joy over the decision , assure him of a pastoral call at the earliest convenient time , and outline the plan for membership preparation classes and membership_sunday . 
some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is report by the visitors . 
it should not be postpone later than the next day . 
a helpful leaflet may be enclose in the letter . 
the pastor call in the home of each individual or family for a spiritual guidance conference . 
if possible , he should make an appointment in_order that all persons involved may be present . 
this be not a social call . 
it be definitely a `` spiritual guidance conference '' . 
he will discuss the significance of christian commitment , the necessity of family religion and private devotions , and the importance of the membership preparation sessions . 
there may be problems of conduct or questions of belief which will require his counsel . 
each conference should be conclude naturally with prayer . 
a_piece of devotional material , such_as the upper_room , may be_left in each home . 
a minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership be necessary for adults . 
some churches require more . 
none should ask less . 
those who join the church need_to be instruct in the faith and the meaning of christian discipleship before they take the sacred vows . 
they will have a greater appreciation for the church and a deeper devotion to_it if membership require something of them . 
many churches find the sunday_school hour to be the_most practical time for adult preparation classes . 
others meet on sunday night , at the mid-week service , or for a series of four nights . 
some pastors have two sessions in one evening , with a refreshment period between . 
the sessions should cover four major areas : 
the christian_faith history of the church_duties of church_membership the local church and its program following each instruction period a_piece of literature deal with the topic should be hand each one for further reading during the week . 
this procedure be much more effective than give_out a membership packet . 
most pastors find that the fourth session should take at_least two hours and therefore hold it on a week night prior to reception sunday . 
in_this session the persons seek membership are provide information concerning the work of the denomination as_well as the program and activities of the local church . 
the lay leadership of the church may be invite to speak on the various phases of church life , service opportunities , the church school , missions , men 's work , women 's work , youth program , social_activities , and finances . 
the budget of the church may be_presented and pledges solicit at this session . 
an `` interest finder '' or `` talent sheet '' may be fill_out by each person . 
( see sample on pp .78 - 79 . ) 
the fourth session may be conclude with a tour of the church facilities and refreshments . 
the social time give an opportunity for church leaders to become acquainted_with the new members . 
in conduct the membership_preparation-inquirers ' class , the pastor should plan a variety of teaching techniques in_order_to develop greater interest on the part of the class . 
the following have been_found effective . 
extend the number of classes . 
some churches have six or more training sessions of two hours each , generally hold on sunday night or during the week . 
this give greater opportunity for the learn process . 
use dramatization - for_example , in discuss the lord 's supper or church symbolism . 
use audio-visual aids . 
some excellent filmstrips with recordings and motion_pictures may be secure from your denominational headquarters to enrich the class session . 
have a `` question box '' . 
some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly . 
urge them to write out their questions for the box . 
use a textbook with assigned readings each_week . 
select class members for reports on various phases of the study . 
conduct examinations , use a true-false check sheet . 
ask each member to write a statement on such topics as : `` what christ mean to me '' , `` what the church mean to me '' , `` why join the church '' , `` the duties of church_members '' , etc. . 
assign a series of catechism questions to be memorize . 
invite class members to share_in an extra period of bible study each_week . 
ask each new member to bring his pledge of loyalty to the reception service . 
there be a grow conviction among pastors and church leaders that all those who come into the fellowship of the church need preparatory training , include those come by transfer of membership . 
george_e._sweazey write : `` there be danger in try to make admission to the church so easy and painless that people will scarcely know that anything has happen '' . 
people appreciate experiences that demand something of them . 
those who transfer their membership be no exception to the rule . 
for most_of them , it will be their first experience in membership training , since this be a recent development in many churches . 
those come from other denominations will welcome the opportunity to become informed . 
the preparatory class be an introductory face-to-face group in_which new members become acquainted_with one another . 
it provide a natural transition into the life of the local church and its organizations . 
the total process of evangelism reach the crescendo when the group of new members stand before the congregation to declare publicly their faith and to be receive into the fellowship of the church . 
this should be a high moment in their lives , a never-to-be-forgotten experience . 
they should sense the tremendous significance of join the spiritual succession reach back to christ our lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages . 
every detail of the service merit careful attention - the hymns , the sermon , the ritual , the right_hand of fellowship , the introduction to the congregation , the welcome of the congregation . 
this be a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation . 
it will help to determine the attitude of the new members toward the church . 
it can mean the difference between participation and inaction , spiritual growth and decay . 
the worship service be the natural and logical time to receive new members into the church . 
the atmosphere for this momentous experience can be create most effectively through the worship experience . 
psychologically the reception should be the climax , follow the sermon . 
ask the new members to meet thirty minutes before the service to complete `` talent sheets '' and pledge cards . 
some denominations ask new members to sign personally the chronological membership register . 
provide a name card for each new member . 
outline plans for the entire service . 
arrange a reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together . 
sponsors may sit with them also . 
invite sponsors or fellowship friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service . 
give each new member a certificate of membership . 
introduce each new member to the congregation , ask him to face the congregation . 
lead the congregation in a response of welcome . 
have a reception for new members in the parlor or social hall immediately after the service . 
take a picture of the group of new members to be put_in the church paper or place on the bulletin_board . 
have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with new members as guests . 
the church be `` the family of god '' . 
the members of the `` family '' are draw_together by a common love for christ and a sincere devotion to his kingdom . 
every member of the family must have a vital place in its life . 
this be no spectator-type experience ; everyone is to be a participant . 
yet the_most difficult problem in the church 's program of evangelism be right at this point - help new members to become participate , grow parts of the fellowship . 
very easily they may be neglect and eventually join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive . 
a study of major denominational membership statistics over a twenty-year period reveal the appalling fact that nearly 40 per_cent of those who join the church were lose to the church within seven years . 
one denomination have a membership of 1419833 at the beginning of the period under study , and twenty years later its membership stand at 1541991 - a net growth of only 122158 . 
yet during the same period there be 1080062 additions . 
another major church body have 4499608 members and twenty years later its membership stand at 4622444 . 
during this time 4122354 new members were bring into the fellowship . 
still another denomination have 7360187 members twenty years ago . 
during this period 7484268 members were receive , yet the net membership now be only 9910741 . 
these figures indicate that we are lose almost as_many as we are receive into membership . 
this problem is illustrate by the fact that many local churches drop from the active membership rolls each_year as_many as they receive into the fellowship . 
studies of membership trends , even in some areas where population is expand , show that numbers of churches have have little net increase , though many new members were receive . 
something be wrong when these things happen . 
the local `` family of god '' has fail its new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare . 
new members can become participate , grow members . 
but this will not happen merely through the natural_process of social life . 
it must be plan and carefully develop . 
the entire membership of the local church must be alert to their part in_this dynamic process . 
if the church has follow the plan of cultivation of prospects and carry_through a program of membership preparation as outline earlier in_this book , the process of assimilation and growth will be well under_way . 
those who enter the front_door of the church intelligently and with christian dedication will not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest . 
however , it be not enough to bring persons to christian commitment and train them in the meaning of christian discipleship . 
when they unite with the church they must find in_this fellowship the satisfaction of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into effective christians . 
the church expect certain things of those who become members . 
the new members justifiably expect some things from their church family : 
men need unity and they need god . 
care must be take_care neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor god with our parochial ideas about him , but with these two qualifications , the statement stand . 
the statement also point to a classic paradox : the more men turn toward god , who be not_only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on_which human unity can ultimately be establish , the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another . 
to be remind of_this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to_which religious divisions have compound political ones , with a resultant fragmentation of the human_race . 
massacres attend the partition of india and the establishment of the state of israel be simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions can engender . 
the words of cardinal_newman come_to_mind forcibly to mind : `` oh how we hate one another for the love of god '' ! 
the source of_this paradox be not difficult to identify . 
it lie_in institutions . 
institutions require structure , form , and definition , and these in_turn entail differentiation and exclusion . 
a completely amorphous institution would be a contradiction_in_terms ; to escape this fate , it must rule_out some things out . 
for every criterion which define what something be , at_the_same_time proclaim - implicitly if_not openly - what that something be not . 
some persons be so sensitive to this truth as to propose that we do_away_with institutions altogether ; in the present context this amount to the advice that while be religious may have a certain justification , we ought to dispense_with churches . 
the suggestion be naive . 
man be at_once a gregarious animal and a form-creating being . 
having once commit himself to an ideal which he consider worthwhile , he inevitably create forms for its expression and institutions for its continuance . 
to propose that men be religious without have religious institutions be like propose that they be learned without have schools . 
both eventualities be possible logically , but practically they be impossible . 
as much_as men intrinsically need the unity that_is ground in god , they instrumentally require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him . 
yet the fact remain that such institutions do set men at_odds with their fellows . 
be there any way_out of the predicament ? 
the only way that i can see be through communication . 
interfaith communication need not be regard_as an unfortunate burden visit upon us by the necessity of maintain diplomatic relations with our adversaries . 
approach creatively , it be a high art . 
it be the art of relate the finite to the infinite , of do our best to insure that the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not thwart god 's intent of unity among men more_than be minimally necessary . 
in a certain sense , interfaith communication parallel diplomatic communication among the nation-states . 
what are the pertinent facts affect such communication at the present juncture of history ? 
i shall touch_on three areas : personal , national , and theological . 
by personal factors i mean those rooted in personality structure . 
some interfaith tensions are not occasion by theological differences at_all , but by the need of men to have persons they can blame , distrust , denounce , and even hate . 
such needs may rise to pathological proportions . 
modern psychology has show that parallel `` the authoritarian personality '' is `` the bigoted personality '' in_which insecurity , inferiority , suspicion , and distrust combine to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufacture if it does not exist naturally . 
fortunately the number of pathological bigots appear to be quite small , but it would be a mistake to think that more_than a matter of degree separate them from the rest of us . 
to_some_extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices attempt to compensate for be to be find in_all of us . 
interfaith conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies be the_most unfortunate of all , for they have no redeeming features whatsoever . 
it be difficult to say what can be do about them except that we must learn to recognize when it be they , rather_than pretexts for them , that are cause the trouble , and do everything possible to nurture the healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies . 
while the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial , nationalism be more variable . 
the specific instance i have_in_mind be the afro-asian version which has gain prominence only in_this second_half of the twentieth century . 
emerge from the two centuries of colonial domination , the afro-asian world be aflame with a nationalism that has undo empires . 
no_less_than twenty-two nations have already achieve independence since world_war 2 , , and the number is grow by the year . 
as an obvious consequence , obstacles to genuine interfaith communication have grow more formidable in one important area : relations between christians and non-christians in these lands . 
colonialism alone would have be able_to make these difficulties serious , for christianity be so closely tie to colonialism in the minds of these people that repudiation of the one has tend automatically toward the repudiation of the other . 
actually , however , this turn_out to be only part of the picture . 
nationalism has abet not_only the repudiation of foreign religions but the revival of native ones , some of_which had been_lying in slumber for centuries . 
the truth be that any revival of traditional and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity and volksgeist which these young nations very_much need . 
insofar as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways_of_life which constitute ultimate , trans-political justifications for their existence , such people are inevitably lead to emphasize the ways in_which these traditions and ways be theirs rather_than someone else 's . 
all this work severely against the kind_of cross-cultural communication for which christian missions stand . 
africans and asians tend to consider not_only missions but the local churches they have produce as centers and agents of western culture and ideology if_not of direct political propaganda . 
the people hardest hit by this suspicion be , of_course , christians on the mainland of china . 
but the problem extend elsewhere . 
for_example , in burma and ceylon many buddhists argue that buddhism ought to be the official state religion . 
in 1960 ceylon nationalize its sectarian - preponderantly christian - schools , to the rejoicing of most_of its 7000000 buddhists and the lament of its 800000 roman_catholics . 
again , india has impose formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries , and fanatical hindu parties are expect to seek further action against christians once the influence make_for tolerance due_to nehru and his followers be gone . 
the progressive closing of afro-asian ears to the christian message is epitomize in a conversation i had three years ago while fly from jerusalem to cairo . 
i be seated next to the director of the seventh_day_adventists ' world radio program . 
he say that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have be available to him on japanese radio networks , but that he had then lack the funds to contract for them . 
after return to the united_states and raise the money , he discover on get_back to japan that the hours be no_longer available . 
it was not that they had been contract for during the interval ; they simply could no_longer be purchase for missionary purposes . 
it be not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contribute measurably to this heightening of anti-christian sentiment . 
ironically , these be the groups which have double or triple their missionary efforts since world_war 2 , , while the more established denominations are barely maintain pre-war staffs . 
although i have emphasize the barriers which an aroused nationalism has raise against relations between christians and non-christians in asia , the fact be that this development has also widen the gulf between certain afro-asian religions themselves . 
the partition of india has hardly improve relations between hindus and muslims ; neither has the establishment of the state of israel foster harmony between muslims and jews . 
i turn finally to several theological developments . 
theocracy reconsider . 
the modern_world has been mark by progressive disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state , whatever its political form . 
the american_constitution be historic at this point in provide that `` congress shall make no law respect an establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof '' . 
one of our foremost jurists , david_dudley_field , has gone so_far as to call this provision `` the greatest achievement ever make in the course of human history '' . 
the trend throughout_the_world 's religions has be toward a recognition of at_least the practical validity of_this constitutional enactment . 
pakistan was create in 1947 expressly as a muslim state , but when the army take_over eleven years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was direct in_part against the inability of political and religious_leaders to think their way through to the meaning of islam for the modern political situation . 
`` what is the point '' , charles_adams report the pakistanis as ask , `` in demand an islamic state and society if no one , not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves , can say clearly and succinctly what the nature of such a state and society be '' ? 
the current regime of president_mohammad_ayub_khan be determinedly secular . 
and while the nation was formerly name `` the islamic_republic of pakistan '' , it is now simply `` the republic of pakistan '' . 
comparable trends can be note elsewhere . 
the new regime in turkey be intentionally less muslim than its predecessor . 
the religious parties in israel have experience a great loss of prestige in recent months . 
during the years when israel was pass from crisis to crisis - the sinai campaign , the infusion of multitudes of penniless immigrants - it was feel that the purpose of national unity could be best serve if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties . 
now that israel enjoy relative prosperity and a reduction of tensions , the secularists be less disposed to compromise . 
and in_this country gustave_weigel 's delineation of the line between the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign serve to provide a most impressive roman_catholic defense of the practical autonomy of both church and state . 
the failure at_that_time of the puerto rican bishops to control the votes of their people add a ring of good_sense to father_weigel 's theological argument . 
everywhere there seem to be a growing recognition of the fact that governments and religious institutions alike be too fallible and corruptible - in a word , too human - to warrant any claim of maintain partnership with the divine . 
salvation reconsider . 
my father go as a missionary to china in a generation that respond to student_volunteer_movement speakers who hold watches in their hands and announce to the students in their audiences how many chinese souls were go_to hell each second because these students be not over there save them . 
that mention of_this should bring smiles to our lips today be as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to_which attitudes have change . 
i do not mean to imply that christians have adopt the liberal assumption , so prevalent in hinduism , that all religions be merely different paths to the same summit . 
leslie_newbiggin reflect the dominant position within the world_council of churches when he say , `` we must claim absoluteness and finality for christ and his finished work , but that very claim forbid us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of_it '' . 
newbiggin 's qualification on the christian claim be of considerable significance . 
the roman_catholic_church has excommunicate one of its priests , father_feeney , for insist that there be no salvation outside the visible church . 
in mention this under `` salvation reconsider '' i do not mean to imply that roman_catholic doctrine has change in_this area but rather that it has become clearer to the world community what that doctrine be . 
when they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to `` permit '' the termination of the human_race by human_action , because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing , they know exactly what they mean . 
of_course , in prudential calculation , in balance the good directly intend and do against the evil unintended and indirectly do , no greater precision can be forthcoming than the subject allow . 
yet it seem clear that there can be no good sufficiently great , or evil repel sufficiently grave , to warrant the destruction of mankind by man 's own action . 
i mean , however , that the moral theologian know what he mean by `` permit '' . 
he is not talk_about in_the_main about probabilities , risks and danger in_general . 
he is talk_about an action which just_as efficaciously do an evil thing ( and be known certainly and unavoidably to lead to this evil result ) as it efficaciously do some good . 
he is talk_about double effects , of_which the specific action cause directly the one and indirectly the other , but cause both ; of_which one is deliberately will or intend and the other not intend or not directly intend , but still both are do , while the evil effect is , with equal consciousness on the part of the agent , foreknow to be among the consequences . 
this be what , in a technical sense , to `` only permit '' an evil result mean . 
it mean to do it and to know one is do it , but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily do and intend . 
of_course , grave guiltiness may be impute to the military_action of any nation , or to the action of any leader or leaders , which for any supposed good `` permit '' , in_this sense , the termination of the human_race by human_action . 
certainly , in analyze an action which truly face such alternatives , `` it be never possible that no world would be preferable to some worlds , and there be in_truth no circumstances in_which the destruction of human life present itself as a reasonable alternative '' . 
naturally , where one or the other of the effects of an action be uncertain , this has to be take_into_account . 
especially be this true when , because the good effect be remote and speculative while the evil be certain and grave , the action is prohibit . 
presumably , if the reverse be the case and the good effect be more certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming , not_only must the good and the evil be prudentially weigh and find proportionate , but also calculation of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be take_into_account . 
there must_not only be greater good than evil objectively in_view , but also greater probability of actually do more good than harm . 
if an evil which be certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensate for by a problematic , speculative , future good , by the same token not every present , certain , and immediate good ( or lesser evil ) that may have to be do will be outweigh by a problematic , speculative , and future evil . 
nevertheless , accord to the traditional theory , a man begin in_the_midst of action and he analyze its nature and immediate cosequences before or while put it forth and cause these consequences . 
he does not expect to be able to trammel_up all the future consequences of his action . 
above_all , he does not debate mere contingencies , and therefore , if these be possibly dreadful , find himself force into inaction . 
he do what he can and may and must , without regard himself as lord of the future or , on_the_other_hand , as cover with guilt by_accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not `` permit '' in the sense explain . 
by contrast , a good_deal of nuclear pacifism begin with the contingencies and the probabilities , and not with the moral nature of the action to be do ; and by derive legitimate decision backward from whatever may conceivably or possibly or probably result , whether by anyone 's do or by_accident , it find itself drive to inaction , to non-political action in politics and non-military action in military affairs , and to the not very surprising discovery that there be now no distinctions on_which the defense of justice can possibly be base . 
mr._philip_toynbee write , for_example , that `` in_terms_of probability it be surely as likely as not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near future if the present situation continue . 
if it continue indefinitely it be nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will be make and that the devastation will begin '' . 
against such a termination of human life on earth by human_action , he then propose as_an_alternative that we `` negotiate at_once with the russians and get the best terms which be available '' , that we deliberately `` negotiate from comparative weakness '' . 
he bravely attempt to face this alternative realistically , i. e. , by consider the worst possible outcome , namely , the total domination of the world by russia within a_few years . 
this would be by_far the better choice , when `` it be a question of allow the human_race to survive , possibly under the domination of a regime which most_of us detest , or of allow it to destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish '' . 
nevertheless , the consequence of the policy propose be everywhere subtly qualified : it be `` a possible result , however improbable '' ; `` the worst , and least probable '' result ; `` if it did n't prevail mankind would still be give the opportunity of prevail '' ; for `` surely anything be better than a policy which allow_for the possibility of nuclear war '' . 
if we have not think and make a decision entirely in these terms , then we need to submit ourselves to the following `` simple test '' : `` have we decide how we are to kill the other members of our household in the event of our be less injured than they be '' ? 
thus , moral decision must be entirely deduce backward from the likely eventuality ; it be no_longer to be formulate in_terms_of the nature of present action itself , its intention , and proximate effect or the thing to be do . 
several of the replies to mr._toynbee , without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard_to the permission of evil , succeed in restore the actual context in_which present moral and political decisions must be make , by distinguish between choose a great evil and choose in danger of_this evil . 
`` it be worse for a nation to give_in to evil than to run_a_risk the risk of annihilation '' . 
`` i be consciously prepared to run_a_risk the continued risk of ' race suicide by_accident ' rather_than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by_design . 
but i can only make this choice because i believe that the risk need not increase , but may be deliberately reduce '' [ by precautions against accidents or by limit war ? ] 
`` quote mr._kennan 's phrase that anything would be better than a policy which lead inevitably to nuclear war , he [ toynbee ] say that anything be better than a policy which allow_for the possibility of nuclear war '' . 
`` if ask to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility , most men will choose the latter '' . 
`` if philip_toynbee is claim that the choice lie between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war , i think he be right . 
i do not accept that the choice be between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war '' . 
even professor_arnold_toynbee , agree with his son , does so in these terms : `` compare to continue to incur a constant risk of the destruction of the human_race , all other evils be lesser evils . 
let us therefore put first things first , and make_sure of preserve the human_race at whatever the temporary price may be '' . 
mr._philip_toynbee affirm at one point that if he share the anticipations of orwell in nineteen eighty-four , if he believe communism be not_only evil but `` also irredeemably evil '' , then he might `` think it right to do anything rather_than to take the risk of a communist world . 
even a nuclear holocaust be a_little less frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupy the earth until doomsday '' . 
no political order or economic_system be so clearly contrary to nature . 
but one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in_that sense , or a static order in_which no changes will take_place in_time , to be able truthfully to affirm the following fact : there has never been justitia imprint in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some pax-ordo preserve by clothed or naked force . 
on their way to the heavenly_city the children of god make use of the pax-ordo of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility for its preservation . 
not to repel injury and uphold and improve pax-ordo mean not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice that challenge it at the moment , but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand . 
toynbee seem to think that there be some other way to give justice social embodiment . 
`` i would far rather die after a russian occupation of_this country - by some deliberate act of refusal - than die uselessly by atomisation '' . 
would such an act of refusal be useful ? 
he does not mean , in_fact he address himself specifically to reject the proposition , that `` if we take the risk of surrender , a new generation in britain would soon begin to amass its strength in_secret in_order_to reverse the consequences of_that surrender '' . 
he want to be `` brutally frank and say that these rebellions would be hopeless - far , far more hopeless than be the hungarian revolution of 1956 '' . 
this be not a project for regain the ground for limited_war , by create a monopoly in one power of the world 's arsenal of unlimited weapons . 
it be a proposal that justice now be served by means other_than those that have ever precondition the search for it , or precondition more positive means for attain it , in_the_past . 
`` it be no good recommend surrender rather_than nuclear warfare with the proviso that surrender could be follow by the effective military resistance by occupied peoples . 
hope for the future would lie_in the natural longing of the human_race for freedom and the right to develop '' . 
this be to surrender in_advance to whatever attack may yet be mount , to the very last ; it be to stride along the steep slope downward . 
the only contrary action , in_the_future as in_the_past , run_a_risk the risk of war ; and , now and in_the_future unlike in_the_past , any attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional justice run_a_risk some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of_it will , by human_action , render this planet less habitable by the human_race . 
that be why it be so_very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision as to `` permitted '' effects , and not draw_back in fright from any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities or probabilities unrelated , or not directly morally related , to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endure . 
finally , just_as no different issues are pose for thoughtful analysis by the foreshorten of time that may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth , but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination , the same thing must be say in connection with the question of_what we may perhaps already be do , by human_action , to accelerate this end . 
we should not allow the image of an immanent end bring_about indirectly by our own action in the continue human struggle for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that in some measure accelerate the end of our lease may be one consequence among others of many other of mankind 's thrusts toward we know not what future . 
much more_than shelter , housing symbolize social_status , a sense of `` belonging '' , acceptance within a given group or neighborhood , identification with particular cultural values and social institutions , feelings of pride and worth , aspirations and hopes basic to human well-being . 
for almost one-sixth of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence cast a considerable shadow upon these values assume as self-evident by most americans . 
few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure to face these realities than real_estate_brokers and home builders . 
this pressure has urge re-evaluation of the assumptions underlie their professional ethics ; it has seek new sympathy for the human aspirations of racial minority groups in_this country . 
it be not surprising that , as spokesman for real_estate interests , the national_association of real_estate boards ( nareb ) and its local associations have seek to limit and often ignore much of_this pressure . 
how does the local realtor see himself in the context of housing restrictions base on race , religion or ethnic attachment ? 
what does he conceive his role to be in_this area of social unrest ? 
what ought to be , what be his potential role as a force for constructive social change ? 
what social , ethical and theological insights can the church and university help him bring_to_bear upon his situation ? 
recently , a group of the faculty at wesleyan_university 's public_affairs_center seek some answers to these questions . 
several new_england realtors were invite to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyers , political_scientists , economists , social psychologists , social ethicists and theologians . 
here , in an atmosphere of forthrightness and mutual criticism , each seek to bring his particular insights to bear_upon the question of discrimination in housing and the part each man present play in it . 
for a_number_of years , wesleyan has been draw varied groups of political and business_leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty and student body , attempt to explore and clarify aspects of their responsibility for public policy . 
this article present our observations of_that session , of the realtors as they see themselves and as the faculty and students see them . 
such conversation quickly reveal an ethically significant ambivalence in the self-images hold by most realtors . 
within the membership of_this group , as has been find true of men in other professional or trade associations , the_most ready portrayal of oneself to `` the public '' be that of a neutral agent simply serve the interests of a seller or buyer and mediate between them . 
professional responsibility is see to consist largely in serve the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner . 
but as conversation go_on , particularly among the realtors themselves , another image emerge , that of considerable power and influence in the community . 
obviously , much more_than customer expectation is determine the realtor 's role . 
judgments are continually render regarding the potential buyers ' income , educational level and above_all , racial extraction ; and whether these would qualify them for `` congenial '' , `` happy '' relations_to other people in certain community areas . 
how explicit such factors have be historically be evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases or in a review of nareb 's code of ethics article 34 in the code , adopt in 1924 , states that `` a realtor should never be instrumental in introduce into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy , members of any race or nationality , or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental_to property values in_that neighborhood '' . 
though the reference_to race was strike by the association in 1950 , be an agent of such `` detrimental '' influences still appear as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves commit to avoid . 
the rationale for this avoidance was most frequently express in economic terms ; all fear the supposed stigma they believe would inevitably attach_to any realtor who openly introduce non-white , particularly negro , peoples into all-white , restricted areas . 
they would become tagged as men not interested in be purely real_estate `` professionals '' but agitators for some kind_of `` cause '' or `` reform '' , and this be no_longer to be a `` pro '' . 
obviously what we are confront with here be the identification of `` professional '' with narrow skills and specialization , the effective servicing of a client , rather_than responsiveness to the wider and deeper meaning and associations of one 's work . 
these men - for_the_most_part educate in our `` best '' new_england colleges , well established financially and socially in the community - under kindly but insistent probing , reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the people they claim to serve , or about the public responses that actually follow their occasional breach of a `` client-service relationship '' . 
this narrow `` professionalism '' does not even fit the present realities of their situation , as the pressure of minorities and the power and respectability of the realtors increase . 
as our discussion continue , the inadequacy of the `` client relationship '' as an interpretation of their `` way of operate '' become evident . 
realtors live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work , as members of social and professional organizations , as citizens and civic_leaders , as church laymen , as university alumni , as newspaper readers , etc. . 
from such communal roles the realtor find the substance that shape his moral understanding . 
it seem to us that choices exercise by realtors in moral situations center in at_least three areas : 
( 1 ) the various ways in_which they interpret a particular social issue ; ( 2 ) their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political processes ; and , most pervasively , ( 3 ) their interpretation of who be a `` real pro '' , of_what it mean to be a professional man in a technical , fragmented society . 
( 1 ) most_of the realtors minimize their own understanding of and role in the racial issue , plead that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society . 
there be some reality to this ; the commission on race and housing conclude that `` there be no reason to believe that real_estate men be either more_or_less racially prejudiced , on_the_whole , than any other segment of the american population '' . 
but such a reaction obscure the powerful efforts make in_the_past by both nareb and its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices . 
also , it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment continually employ . 
like business and university groups generally , these men have very limited knowledge of recent sociological and psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions they make . 
realtors , both generally and in_this group , have invariably equate residential integration with a decline in property values , a circumstance view with considerable apprehension . 
recent studies by the commission on race and housing and_others , however , point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion . 
there be increasing numbers of neighborhoods that be integrate residentially without great loss of property values , the white population having take the initiative in prepare the areas for an appreciation of the negroes ' desire for well-kept housing , privacy , etc. . 
data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial group enter it has to be assess in_terms_of the trends in property values before the group come_in . 
often they be able to get_in only because the area is decline economically . 
significantly , no realtor and few of the faculty present be familiar with any of the six volumes ( publish by the university of california_press ) that present the commission 's findings . 
no one anticipate any radical shift in_this situation , but questions concern reading habits , the availability of such data and the places where it is discuss must surely be raise . 
the role of both church and university as sources of information and settings within which the implications of such information may be explore need consideration . 
relevant `` facts '' , however , extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance of `` harmonious '' neighborhoods . 
discussion of minority housing necessarily involve such basic issues as the intensity of one 's democratic conviction and religious_belief concern equality of opportunity , the function and limitations of government in the securing of such equality , and the spotlight that world opinion play upon local incidents of racial agitation and strife . 
( 2 ) realtors realize , of_course , that they are involve in an increasingly complex legal and political_system that_is open_up opportunities for leverage on their relation_to clients as_well as opportunities for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination in housing . 
on the positive side , recent federal action has largely undermine the legal sanction so_long enjoy by the segregationist position ; anti-discriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopt by thirteen states and , while specific provisions have vary , the tendency be clearly toward expand coverage . 
realtors in_attendance at the colloquium express interest , for_example , in connecticut 's new housing law as set standards of equity that they would like `` to have to obey '' , but in support of_which none had been willing to go on public record . 
as far as they be aware , the connecticut_association of real_estate boards had not officially oppose the bill 's passage or lobby in its support . 
( this has not be the case everywhere . 
in 1957 , the real_estate boards of new_york_city actively oppose the then pending private housing anti-discrimination law . 
official reasoning : 
the bill be a `` wanton invasion of basic property_rights '' . ) 
there be sins of omission as_well as commission ; the attitude adopt by realtors and their associations , either negative or positive , play a large part in the public acceptance of such measures and the degree to_which they may be effectively enforce . 
judicial opinion since the supreme_court decision on shelley v. kraemer ( 1948 ) has render racial restrictive covenants unenforcible . 
such a decision should have place a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing_industry , but there be little evidence that realtors , or at_least their associations , have repudiate the principle in such clauses . 
in the states that have pass laws prevent discrimination in the sale or rental of housing , support by real_estate associations for compliance and broadened coverage through additional legislation could help remove the label of `` social reformism '' that most realtors individually seem determined to avoid . 
but as_yet , no real_estate board has be willing officially to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introduce minority buyers into all-white neighborhoods . 
one of the roles of the social_scientist , ethicist or theologian in our discussions with the realtors become that of encourage greater awareness of the opportunities offer by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work . 
but responsiveness to these opportunities presume that all_of us judge the good as a human good and not simply as a professional , white , american good . 
such judgments be meaningful only in_so_far as persons be members of a world , let us say a community , that embrace scarsdale or yonkers , but be also infinitely richer since it be all-inclusive . 
that community of all creation be , then , the ultimate object of our loyalty and the concrete norm of all moral judgment . 
racial discrimination be wrong , then , not because it go_against the grain of a faculty_member try to converse with a_few realtors but because it go_against the grain of creation and against the will of the creator . 
thus , moral issues concern the nature of the legal and political processes take_on theological dimensions . 
( 3 ) over the years , individuals engage in the sale of real_estate have develop remarkable unity in the methods and practices employ . 
most realtors and real_estate_brokers talk of themselves as `` professional people '' with the cultural and moral values hold by the traditional professions . 
but what significance attach_to `` professional '' , beyond the narrow sense of skillfulness in meet a client 's stated needs as already note ? 
our faculty and students press this issue more_than any other . 
as a theologian in the group point_out , a professional be , before the modern period of technical specialization , one who `` profess '' to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use of his particular skills . 
if we look about the world today , we can see clearly that there be two especially significant factors shape the future of our civilization : science and religion . 
science is place in our hands the ultimate power of the universe , the power of the atom . 
religion , or the lack of_it , will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new_world of peace and abundance for all mankind , or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed . 
how can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge ? 
we may feel pessimistic at the outlook . 
and yet there be a note of hope , because this same science that_is give us the power of the atom is also give us atomic vision . 
we are look inside the atom and see there a universe which be not material but something beyond the material , a universe that in a word be not matter but music . 
and it be in_this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith . 
to see this vision in perspective , we need first_of_all a clear idea of the magnitude of_this new power from the atom . 
you know that i could hold right here in my hand the little chunk of uranium metal that be the heart of the bomb that drop on hiroshima . 
it be only about the size of a baseball ; but pack in_that metallic ball there be the explosive force of 20000 tons of tnt . 
that be enough tnt to fill the tower of the empire_state building ; and with the availability of bombs of_that size , war become a new problem . 
now we might have restrict the use of uranium bombs by control the sources of uranium because it is found in only a_few places in the world . 
but we had hardly start to adjust our thinking to this new uranium weapon when we were face with the hydrogen_bomb . 
hydrogen be just_as plentiful as uranium be scarce . 
we know that we have hydrogen in water ; water be * * f and the h stand_for hydrogen ; there be also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies . 
i have calculate that if i could snap my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body , i would explode with the force of a_hundred bombs of the kind that fall on hiroshima . 
i won n't try the experiment , but i think you can see that if we all know the secret and we could all let_go ourselves go , there would be quite an explosion . 
and_then think how little hydrogen we have in us compare with the hydrogen in delaware_bay or in the ocean beyond . 
salt water be still * * f , the same hydrogen is there . 
and the size of the ocean show us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in our hands today . 
of_course , there be also an optimistic side to the picture . 
for if i know the secret of let this power in my body change directly into electricity , i could rent_out myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body i could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire united_states for some days . 
and think , if we all know this secret and we could pool our power , what a wonderful public_utility company we would make . 
with just the hydrogen of our bodies , we could run the world for years . 
then think of delaware_bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come . 
it be power with which we can literally rebuild the world , provide adequate housing , food , education , abundant living for everyone everywhere . 
now let us see where this power come from . 
to grasp our new view of the atom , we have to appreciate first_of_all how small the atom be . 
i have been try to make this clear to my own class in chemistry . 
one night there be some dried peas lie on our kitchen_table , and these peas look to me like a_little group of atoms ; and i ask myself a question : suppose i have the same number of peas as there be atoms in my body , how large an area would they cover ? 
i calculate first that there be about an octillion atoms in the average human_body ; that_is a figure one with 27 ciphers , quite a large_number . 
then i calculate that a_million peas would just_about fill a household refrigerator ; a_billion peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic ; a_trillion peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten_thousand people ; and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of philadelphia . 
i see that i would soon run_out of buildings at this rate , so i decide to take another measure - the whole state of pennsylvania . 
imagine that there be a blizzard over pennsylvania , but instead of snow snow , it snow peas ; so we get the whole state covered with peas , about four feet deep . 
you can imagine what it would look_like go out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against the houses and cover the cars ; pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about a quintillion peas . 
but we still have a long way to go . 
next we imagine our blizzard rage over all the land_areas of the entire globe - north_america , south_america , europe , asia , and africa , all covered with peas four feet deep ; then we have sextillion peas . 
next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole earth with peas , then we go out among the neighboring stars , collect 250 planets each the size of the earth , and also cover each of these with peas four feet deep ; and_then we have septillion . 
finally we go into the farthest reaches of the milky_way ; we get 250000 planets ; we cover each of these with our blanket of peas and_then at_last we have octillion peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body . 
so you see how small an atom be and_how complicated you be . 
now although an atom be small , we can still in imagination have_a_look at it . 
let us focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that i swallow a magic alice in wonderland growing pill . 
i start grow rapidly and this calcium atom grow along with me . 
i shoot_up through the roof , into the sky , past the clouds , through the stratosphere , out beyond the moon , out among the planets , until i be over a_hundred and fifty million miles long . 
then this atom of calcium will swell to something like a great balloon a_hundred yards across , a balloon big enough to put a football_field inside . 
and if you should step inside of such a magnified atom , according to the physics of forty years ago , you would see circulate over your head , down at the sides , and under your feet , some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs . 
these balls are move in great_circles and ellipses , and be of_course , the electrons , the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make_up the solid structure of my finger bone . 
since these electrons are move like planets , you may wonder whether there be an atomic sun at the center of the atom . 
so you look down there and you see a tiny , whirling point about the size of the head of a pin . 
this be the atomic sun , the atomic nucleus . 
even if the atom be big enough to hold a football_field , this nucleus be still only about the size of a pinhead . 
it be this atomic nucleus that contain the positive_charge of electricity hold these negatively_charged electrons in their orbits ; it also contain nearly all the mass , and the atomic_energy . 
you may ask what else there be , and the answer be nothing - nothing but empty space . 
and since you be made of atoms , you be nothing much but empty space , too . 
if i could put your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down , squeeze these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge , you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole be gone , you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you could see on this piece_of_paper . 
someone has remark that this be certainly the ultimate in reducing . 
at_any_rate , it show us how immaterial we be . 
now this 1920 view of the atom be on_the_whole a discouraging picture . 
for we believe that the electrons obey the law of mechanics and electrodynamics ; and therefore the atom be really just a_little machine ; and in mechanics the whole be no_more_than the sum of the parts . 
so if you be made of atoms , you be just a big machine ; and since the universe is also make of atoms , it be just a supermachine . 
and this would mean that we live in a mechanistic universe , govern by the laws of cause and effect , bind in_chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely predetermined course in_which there be not room for soul or spirit or human freedom . 
and this be why so many scientists a half a century ago be agnostics or atheists . 
then come the scientific revolution in the late 1920 's . 
a suggestion from louis de broglie , a physicist in france , show us that these electrons be not point particles but waves . 
and to see the meaning of_this new picture , imagine that you can put_on more powerful glasses and go_back inside the atom and have_a_look at it in the way we view it today . 
now as you step inside , instead of see particles orbit around like planets , you see waves and ripples very_much_like the ripples that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it . 
these ripples spread_out in symmetrical patterns like the rose_windows of a great cathedral . 
and as the waves flow back_and_forth and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms , you can put_on a magic hearing_aid and you hear music . 
it be a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra play a symphony . 
harmony , melody , counterpoint symphonic structure be there ; and as this music ebb and flow , there be an antiphonal chorus from all the atoms outside , in_fact from the atoms of the entire universe . 
and so today when we examine the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the universe , we are force to conclude that the best word to describe our universe be music . 
the island of nantucket , part of the state of massachusetts , lie about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother state . 
some of the island be sand and be not suitable for live . 
the island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors ; the rest is obtain from harbor scallops . 
during about three and a half months of the year , in the summer , there be three boats that run from the mainland to the island carry passengers , food , and cars ; but the rest of the year only one boat is need , which tie_up at the mainland nights and make the trip down to nantucket in the daytime . 
this be a fine trip , too , on a good_day . 
with martha 's vineyard on_one_side and the open sea on the other , it make an excellent trip of about three hours . 
to_what_extent and in_what ways did christianity affect the united_states_of_america in the nineteenth century ? 
how far and in_what fashion did_it modify the new nation which was emerge in_the_midst of the forces shape the revolutionary age ? 
to_what_extent did_it mould the morals and the social , economic , and political life and institutions of the country ? 
a complete picture be impossible - partly because of the limitations of space , partly because for millions of individuals who profess allegiance to the christian faith data be unobtainable . 
even more of an obstacle be the difficulty of separate the influence of christianity from other factors . 
although a complete picture cannot be give , we can indicate some aspects of life into which the christian faith enter as at_least one creative factor . 
at_times we can say that it be the major factor . 
what in some ways be the_most important aspect be the impact individually on the millions who constitute the nation . 
as we have see , a growing proportion , although in 1914 still a minority , be members of churches . 
presumably those who did not have a formal church connexion had also feel the influence of christianity to a greater or less extent . 
many_of them had once be members of a church or at_least had been give instruction in christianity but for one or another reason had allow the connexion to lapse . 
the form of christianity to_which they were expose be for some the protestantism of the older stock , for others the protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration ; for still others , mostly of the nineteenth-century immigration , it be roman_catholicism , and for a small minority it be eastern_orthodoxy . 
upon all_of them play the intellectual , social , political , and economic attitudes , institutions , and customs of the nation . 
upon most_of these christianity had leave an impress and through them had had a share in make the individual what he be . 
yet to determine precisely to_what_extent and exactly in_what ways any individual show the effects of christianity would be impossible . 
at_best only an approximation could be arrive_at . 
to generalize for the entire nation would be absurd . 
for_instance , we cannot know whether even for church_members the degree of conformity to christian standards of morality increase or decline as the proportion of church_members in the population rise . 
the temptation be to say that , as the percentage of church_members mount , the degree of discipline exercise by the churches lessen and the trend be towards conformity to the general level . 
yet this cannot be prove . 
we know that in the early part of the century many protestant congregations take positive action against members who transgress the ethical_codes to_which the majority subscribe . 
thus baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance of charges against their members of drunkenness , fighting , malicious_gossip , lying , cheating , sexual irregularities , gambling , horse_racing , and failure to pay just debts . 
if guilty , the offender might be exclude from membership . 
as church membership burgeon , such measures fade into desuetude . 
but whether this was accompany by a general lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know . 
what we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point_out the manner in_which christianity enter into particular aspects of the life of the nation . 
we have already hint at the fashion in_which christianity contribute to education and so to intellectual life . 
we will now speak of the ways in_which it help shape the ideals of the country and of the manner in_which it stimulate efforts to attain those ideals through reform_movements , through programmes for bring the collective life to the nation to conformity to christian standards , and through leaders in the government . 
throughout the nineteenth century christianity exert its influence on american society as_a_whole primarily through the protestantism of the older stock . 
by the end of the century the roman_catholic_church was begin to make itself feel , mainly through such institutions as hospitals but also through its attitude towards organized labour . 
in the twentieth century its influence grow , as did that of the protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration . 
the ideals of the country were deeply indebted to the protestantism of the older stock . 
thus `` america '' , the_most widely sing of the patriotic songs , was write by a new_england baptist clergyman , samuel_francis_smith ( 1808 - 1895 ) , while a student in andover_theological_seminary . 
with its zeal for liberty and its dependence on god it breathed the spirit which had been nourish on the evangelical revivals . 
the great_seal of the united_states was obviously inspire by the christian faith . 
here be what was call the american_dream , namely , the effort to build a structure which would be something new in history and to do so in such fashion that god could bless it . 
later in the century the dream again find expression in the lines of katherine_lee_bates ( 1859 - 1929 ) , daughter and granddaughter of new_england congregational ministers , in her widely sung hymn , write in 1893 , `` america the beautiful '' , with the words `` o beautiful for pilgrim feet whose stern impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom beat across the wilderness . 
america , america , god mend thy every flaw , confirm thy soul in self control , thy liberty in law . 
o beautiful for patriot dream that see beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears . 
america , america , god shed his grace on thee , and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea '' . 
the american_dream was compound of many strains . 
some be clearly of christian origin , among them the great_awakening and other revivals which help to make christian liberty , christian equality , and christian fraternity the passion of the land . 
some have see revivalism and the search for christian perfection as the fountain-head of the american hope . 
here , too , must be place unitarianism and , less obviously from christian inspiration , emerson , transcendentalism , and the idealism of walt_whitman . 
we must also remember those who react against the dream as a kind_of myth - among them melville , hawthorne , and henry_james the elder , all_of them out of a christian background . 
with such a dream arise , at_least in_part , from the protestant heritage of the united_states and build into the foundations of the nation , it be not surprising that many efforts were make to give it concrete expression . 
a number be in the nature of movements to relieve or remove social ills . 
significantly , the initiation and leadership of a major proportion of the reform_movements , especially those in the first_half of the nineteenth century , come from men and women of new_england birth or parentage and from either trinitarian or unitarian_congregationalism . 
several of the movements were give a marked impetus by revivalism . 
quakers , some from new_england , have a larger share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warrant . 
we do_well to remind ourselves that from men and women of new_england ancestry also issue the church of jesus_christ of latter day_saints , the seventh_day_adventists , christian_science , the american_board of commissioners for foreign_missions , the american_home_missionary_society , the american_bible_society , and new_england theology . 
the atmosphere be one of optimism , of confidence in human progress , and of a determination to rid the world of its ills . 
the hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence , although hold to original_sin and the doctrine of election , inspire its adherents to heroic endeavours for others , look_for the early coming of the millennium , and was parallel by the confidence in man 's ability cherish by the unitarians , emerson , and the transcendentalists . 
we should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind which arise from the kindred evangelicalism of the_british isles and the pietism of the continent of europe - among them prison reform , anti-slavery measures , legislation for the alleviation of conditions of labour , the inner_mission , and the red_cross . 
we cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation of collective ills . 
a_few of the more prominent must serve as examples of_what a complete listing and description would disclose . 
several be_born in the early decades and persist throughout the century . 
others be ephemeral . 
some disappear with the attainment of their purpose . 
still others spring_up late in the century to meet conditions which arise from fresh stages of the revolutionary age . 
the movement to end negro slavery begin before 1815 and mount after_that year until , as a result of the civil_war , emancipation was achieve . 
long before 1815 the christian conscience was lead some to declare slavery wrong and to act accordingly . 
for_example , in 1693 the philadelphia_yearly meeting of friends declare that its members should emancipate their slaves and in 1776 it determine to exclude from membership all who did not comply . 
in the latter year samuel_hopkins , from whom the hopkinsian strain of new_england theology take its name , ask the continental_congress to abolish slavery . 
as we have see , methodism early take a stand against slavery . 
begin at_least as far back as 1789 various baptist bodies condemn slavery . 
after 1815 anti-slavery sentiment mount , chiefly among protestants and those of protestant background of the older stock . 
the nineteenth-century immigration , whether protestant or roman_catholic , was not so_much concern , for very_few if any among them hold slaves : 
they be mostly in the northern states where slavery had disappear or be on the way out , or be too poverty-stricken to own slaves . 
the anti-slavery movement took_many_forms . 
benjamin_lundy ( 1789 - 1839 ) , a quaker , be a pioneer in prepare the way for anti-slavery societies . 
it be he who turn the attention of william_lloyd_garrison ( 1805 - 1879 ) to the subject . 
garrison , massachusetts born of nova_scotian parentage , be by_temperament and conviction a reformer . 
chiefly remember because of his incessant advocacy of `` immediate and unconditional abolition '' , he also espouse a great variety of other causes - among them women 's rights , prohibition , and justice to the indians . 
incurably optimistic , dogmatic , and utterly fearless , in his youth a devout baptist , in_spite_of his friendship for the quaker poet john_greenleaf_whittier ( 1807 - 1892 ) he eventually attack the orthodox_churches for what he deem their cowardly compromise on the slavery issue and in his invariably ardent manner be emphatically unorthodox and deny the plenary inspiration of the bible . 
a marked impulse come to the anti-slavery movement through the finney revivals . 
finney himself , while oppose to slavery , place his chief emphasis on evangelism , but from his converts issue much of the leadership of the anti-slavery campaign . 
theodore_dwight_weld ( 1803 - 1895 ) be especially active . 
weld be the son and grandson of new_england congregational ministers . 
as a youth he become one of finney 's band of evangelists and give himself to win young_men . 
a strong temperance advocate , through the influence of a favorite teacher , charles_stewart , another finney convert , he devote himself to the anti-slavery cause . 
a group of young_men influence by him enrol in lane_theological_seminary and have to leave because of their open anti-slavery position . 
the majority then go_to the infant oberlin . 
they and_others employ some of finney 's techniques as they seek to win adherents to the cause . 
weld contribute to the anti-slavery convictions of such men as joshua_r._giddings and edwin_m._stanton , enlist john_quincy_adams , and help provide ideas which underlie harriet_beecher_stowe 's uncle_tom 's cabin . 
he shun publicity for himself and seek to avoid fame . 
wendell_phillips ( 1811 - 1884 ) , from a prominent massachusetts family , in his teens was convert under the preaching of lyman_beecher . 
although he later break_with the churches because he believe that they be insufficiently outspoken against social evils , he remain a devout christian . 
he was remember chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition , but he also stand for equal rights for women , for opportunity for the freedmen , and for prohibition . 
the anti-slavery movement and other contemporary reforms and philanthropies were give leadership and financial undergirding by arthur_tappan ( 1786 - 1865 ) and his younger brother , lewis_tappan ( 1788 - 1873 ) . 
individuals possess unusual gifts and great personal power were transmute at death into awesome spirits ; they were almost immediately worship for these newer , even more terrible abilities . 
their direct descendants inherit not_only their worldly fortunes , but also the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of the universe . 
royal lineages could be base on extraordinary worldly achievements translate into eternal otherworldly power . 
thus , the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less puissant ancestors . 
but this eminence be not without its weighty responsibilities . 
since he possess more power in an interdependent universe of living beings and dead spirits , the emperor have to use it for the benefit of the living . 
the royal ritual generate power into the other world : it also provide the living with a way to control the spirits , and bring their powers directly to bear_on the everyday affairs of the world . 
proper ritual observance at any level of society be capable_of generate power for use in the spirit_world ; but naturally , the royal ritual , which provide unusual control over already supremely powerful divine spirits , was hold responsible_for regulate the universe and insure the welfare of the kingdom . 
this be the familiar system of `` cosmic government '' . 
the chinese emperor , by proper observance of ritual , manifest divine powers . 
he regulate the dualities of light and darkness , yang and yin , which are lock in eternal struggle . 
by sway the balance between them , he effect the alternation of the seasons . 
his power be so great that he even promote and demote gods accord to whether they had give_ear or be deaf_to petitions . 
in_this system , no man be exempt from obligations . 
failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one 's family , outrages to community propriety , any departure from rigid standards of moral_excellence be offenses against the dead . 
and to offend the dead mean to incur their wrath , and thus provoke the unleashing of countrywide disasters . 
the family home be , in_fact , a temple ; and the daily duties of individuals be basically religious in nature . 
the dead spirits occupy a prominent place in every hope and in every fear . 
the common belief be that there exist one moral order , which include everything . 
the dead control the material prosperity of the living , and the living adhere to strict codes_of_conduct in_order not to weaken that control . 
men believe they could control nature by obey a moral code . 
if the moral code were flout , the proper balance of the universe would be upset , and the disastrous result could be floods , plague , or famine . 
modern westerners have difficulty comprehend this fusion of moral and material , largely because in the west the historical trend has be to deny the connection . 
live in urban conditions , away from the deadweight of village constraint and the constrictions of a thatched-roof world_view , the individual may find it possible , say , to commit adultery not_only without personal misgivings , but also without suffer any adverse effects in his worldly fortunes . 
base action on the empirical determination of cause and effect provide a toughness and bravado that no powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart - plus the added liberation from the constraint of silent burial urns . 
in china , the magical system par_excellence be taoism . 
the taoists be quietist mystics , who see an unchanging unity - the tao - underlie all phenomena . 
it be this timeless unity that be all-important , and not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality . 
the taoists believe the unity could be influence by proper magical manipulation ; in_other_words , they be actually an organization of magicians . 
mahayana_buddhism be no exception to these prevailing magical concepts . 
after this form of indian_buddhism had been introduce into china , it undergo extensive changes . 
during its flowering in the sixth to the eighth centuries , mahayana offer a supernatural package to the chinese which bear no resemblance to the highly digested philosophical zen morsels offer to the modern western reader . 
mahayana have gods , and magic , a pantheon , heavens and hells , and gorgeously appareled priests , monks , and nuns , all_of whom wield power over souls in the other world . 
the self-realized mahayana saint possess superhuman powers and magic . 
the mahayana that develop in_the_north be a religion of idolatry and coarse magic , that make the world into a huge magical garden . 
in its monastic form , mahayana be merely an organization of magic-practicing monks ( bonzes ) , who cater to the chinese faith in the supernatural . 
nonmagical_confucianism be a secular , rational philosophy , but even with this different orientation it could not escape_from the ethos of a cosmic government . 
confucianism have its own magic in the idea that virtue have power . 
if a man live a classical life , he need not fear the spirits - for only lack of virtue give the spirits power over him . 
but let us not be mistake about confucian `` virtue '' ; this be not virtue as we understand the word today , and it did not mean an abandonment of the belief in magic manipulation . 
to the confucian , `` virtue '' simply mean mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rules of ritual and three thousand minor ones . 
propriety be synonymous with ritual observance , the mark of a true gentleman . 
to live correctly in an interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead be decisive for man 's fate . 
this , in_brief , be the historical background out of_which zen emerge . 
promoters of zen to the west record its ancestry , and recognize that zen grow out of a combination of taoism and indian_mahayana_buddhism . 
but the `` marvelous person '' that be supposed to result from zen exhibit more chinese practicality than indian speculation - he possess magical_powers , and can use them to order nature and to redeem souls . 
proponents of zen to the west emphasize disproportionately the amount of mahayana_buddhism in zen , probably in_order_to dignify the indisputably magical taoist ideas with more respectable buddhist metaphysic . 
but in the chinese mind , there be little difference between the two - the bonzes be no_more metaphysical than a magician has_to be . 
actually , zen owe more to chinese quietism than it does to mahayana_buddhism . 
the ch ' an ( zen ) sect may have derive its metaphysic from mahayana , but its psychology be pure early taoist . 
this is_well evidence by the quietist doctrines carry_over in zen : the idea of the inward turn of thought , the enjoinder to put aside desires and perturbations so_that a return to purity , peace , and stillness - a union with the infinite , with the tao - could be effect . 
in_fact , the antipathy to outward ceremonies hail by modern exponents as so uniquely characteristic of the `` direct thinking '' zennist be a feature of taoism . 
so , too , be the insistence on the relativity of the external world , and the ideas that language and things perceive by consciousness be poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by pure , indwelling spirit : 
the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating consciousness . 
zen maintain that cognitive things be only the surface of experience . 
one of its features attractive to the west be its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred_texts . 
one patriarch is suppose to have relegate sacred scriptures for use in an outhouse . 
but this be not the spirit of self-reliant freedom of action for which the westerner mistake it . 
it be simply that in taoist tradition - as in_all good mysticisms - books , words , or any other manifestations that belong_to the normal state of consciousness are consider only the surface of experience . 
the truth - the eternal truth - be not transmittable by words . 
reality is consider not_only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge , but a positive handicap . 
the technique of reality confusion - the use of paradox and riddles to shake the mind 's grip on reality - originate with fourth and third century b._c._chinese_quietism : the koan be not basically a new device . 
it is important for an understanding of zen to realize that the esoteric preoccupations of the select few cannot be the doctrine of the common_man . 
in the supernatural atmosphere of cosmic government , only the ruling elite be ever concerned with a kingdom-wide ordering of nature : popular religion aim at more personal benefits from magical_powers . 
and this be only natural - witness the haste with which modern_man gobble the latest `` wonder_drug '' . 
early chinese anchoritism was theoretically aim at a mystic pantheist union with the divine , personal salvation being achieve when the mystical recluse unite with divine essence . 
but this esoteric doctrine was lose in the shuffle to acquire special powers . 
the anchorite strive , in_fact , to magically influence the world of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifest his power . 
thus , the mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation was distill down to a bare self-seeking , and for this reason , the mystic in asia did not_long remain in isolated contemplation . 
as the zen literature reveal , as soon as an early zen master attain fame in seclusion , he was_called out into the world to exercise his powers . 
the early anchorite masters attract disciples because of their presumed ability to perform miracles . 
exponents of zen often insist that very early zen doctrine oppose the rampant supernaturalism of china , and propose instead a more mature , less credulous view of the universe . 
in support of_this , stories from the early literature are cite to show that zen attack the idea of supernatural power . 
but actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters were in_fact supposed to possess , as_well as the extreme degree of popular credulity : `` hwang_pah ( o baku ) , one_day go_up mount_tien_tai , which was believe to have been inhabit by arhats with supernatural powers , meet with a monk whose eyes emit strange light . 
they go along the pass talk with each other for a short while until they come to a river roar with torrent . 
there be no bridge , the master have to stop at the shore ; but his companion cross the river walk on the water and beckon to hwang_pah to follow him . 
thereupon hwang_pah say : '' if i know thou art an arhat , i would have double_up you up before thou get_over there `` ! 
the monk then understand the spiritual attainment of hwang_pah , and praise him as a true mahayanist . 
( 1 ) '' a second tale show still more clearly the kind_of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess : `` on_one_occasion yang_shan ( kyo-zan ) see a stranger monk fly through the air . 
when that monk come_down and approach him with a respectful salutation , he ask : 
'' where art thou from `` ? 
'' early this morning `` , reply the other , '' i set_out from india `` . 
'' why `` , say the teacher , '' art thou so late `` ? 
'' i stop `` , respond the man , '' several_times to look at beautiful sceneries `` . 
'' thou mayst have supernatural powers `` , exclaim yang_shan , '' yet thou must give back the spirit of buddha to me `` . 
then the monk praise yang_shan say : '' i have come over to china in_order_to worship manjucri , and meet unexpectedly with minor_shakya `` , and after give the master some palm leaves he bring from india , go_back through the air . 
( 2 ) '' in the popular chinese mind , ch ' an ( zen ) be no exception to the ideas of coarse magic that dominate . 
a closer look at modern zen reveal many magical carryovers that be still part of popular zen attitudes . 
to the zen monk the universe is still populate with `` spiritual_beings '' who have_to be appease . 
part of the mealtime ritual in the zendo consist_in offerings of rice to the spiritual_beings `` . 
modern_zen presentation to the west insist on the anti-authoritarian , highly pragmatic nature of the zen belief - scriptures are burn to make fire , action is base on direct self-confidence , and_so_on . 
this picture of extreme self-reliant individuation be difficult to reconcile with such zendo formulas as : '' o you , demons and other spiritual_beings , i now offer this to you , and may this food fill_up the ten quarters of the world and all the demons and other spiritual_beings be feed therewith . 
pope_leo 13 , , on the 13 th day of december 1898 , grant the following indulgences : `` an indulgence of three hundred days is grant to all the faithful who read the holy_gospels at_least a quarter of an hour . 
a plenary_indulgence under the usual conditions is grant once a month for the daily reading '' . 
pope_pius the sixth , at rome , in april , 1778 , write the following : 
`` the faithful should be excite to the reading of the holy_scriptures : for these be the_most abundant sources which ought_to be_left open_to everyone , to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine , to eradicate errors which are so widely disseminate in these corrupt times '' . 
the american_bishops assemble at the third_plenary_council of baltimore urge the catholic people to read the holy_bible . 
`` we hope '' , they say , `` that no family can be find amongst us without a correct version of the holy_scriptures '' . 
they recommend , also , that `` at a fixed hour , let the entire family be assemble for night prayers , follow by a short reading of the holy_scriptures '' . 
since the catholic_church express such desire that the sacred scriptures be read , the following take from the holy_bible ( new_catholic_edition ) will prove a means of grace and a source of great spiritual blessing . 
do not wonder that i say to thee , `` you must be_born again '' .

you may be very religious , a good church_member , an upright , honest and sincere person ; you may be baptize , confirmed , reverent and worshipful ; you may attend mass , do penance , say prayers and zealously keep all the sacraments and ceremonies of the church ; you may have the final and extreme_unction but if you be_born not be_born again you be lost and head for hell and eternal punishment . 
you cannot be save ; you cannot go_to heaven unless you be_born again . 
our blessed lord jesus_christ , the sinless son of god , who could not lie , say , `` amen , amen , i say to thee , unless a man be_born again , he cannot see the kingdom_of_god '' ( st._john 3 : 3 ) . 
`` you must be_born again '' ( st._john 3 : 7 ) . 
being convinced that salvation be alone by accept christ as saviour , and being convict by the holy_spirit of my lost condition , i do repent of all effort to be save by any form of good works , and just_now receive jesus as my personal saviour and salvation as a free gift from him . 
you may do as you please with god now . 
it be permitted . 
god place himself in men 's hands when he send jesus_christ into the world as perfect god and perfect man in one being . 
he be then in man 's hands . 
they curse him . 
it was permit . 
men spit on him . 
god allow it . 
they call him a devil . 
god withhold his wrath . 
finally men arrest him , give him a mock trial , flog him , nail him on a cross and hang him between earth and heaven ; and god allow it . 
you can do likewise though christ be not bodily present . 
you can ignore him . 
you can ignore his book , the bible , and his church . 
you can laugh_at his blood-bought salvation , curse his followers , and laugh_at hell . 
it is permit . 
the eternal christ may knock at your soul 's door , call you to give_up sin and prepare for heaven . 
you may refuse him , spit on him , call him a devil , curse him . 
it is permit . 
you may take his name upon your lips in oaths and curses if you so choose . 
he be in your hands - now . 
on_the_other_hand , you may seek his favor , humble yourself before him and beg his mercy , implore his forgiveness , forsake your sins , and abandon your whole life to him . 
he has say , `` behold , i stand at the door , and knock : if any man hear my voice , and open the door , i will come_in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me '' ( revelation 3 : 20 ) . 
the choice be up_to you . 
the latch be on your side of the door . 
the choice be yours : the revellings and banquetings of_this world or quiet communion with god ; the ever burning lusts of the flesh or the powerful victory of holy_spirit discipline . 
the choice be yours : god be in your hands , now . 
god has already set the day when you will be in his hands . 
what he do with you then depend_on what you do with him now . 
then it will be a `` fearful thing to fall_into the hands of the living god '' if you have abuse him in your hands . 
i be a magazine ; my name be guideposts ; this issue that you are read mark my 15 th anniversary . 
when i come_into_being , 15 years ago , i have one primary purpose : to help men and women everywhere to know god better , and through know him better to become happier and more effective people . 
that purpose has never change . 
when you read me , you are hold in your hands the product of many minds and hearts . 
some of the people who speak through my pages be famous ; others unknown . 
some work with their hands . 
some have walked through pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope . 
some be so filled with gratitude , for the gift of life and the love of god , that their joy spill_out on the paper and brighten the lives of thousands whom they have never know , and will never see . 
fifteen years ago , there be no guideposts at_all . 
this month a_million guideposts will circulate all_over the world . 
experts in the publishing field consider this astounding . 
they do not understand how a small magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale could have achieve such a following . 
to me , the explanation be very simple . 
i am not do anything , of myself . 
i be merely a channel for something . 
what be this something ? 
i cannot define it fully . 
it be the force in the universe that make men love goodness , even when they turn_away from it . 
it be the power that hold the stars in their orbits , but allow the wind to bend a blade of grass . 
it be the whisper in the heart that urge each one to be better than he be . 
it be mankind 's wistful yearning for a world of justice and peace . 
all things be possible to god , but he choose - usually - to work through people . 
sometimes such people sense that they are being use ; sometimes not . 
fifteen years ago , trouble by the rising_tide of materialism in the post-war world , a businessman and a minister ask themselves if there might_not be a place for a small magazine in_which men and women , regardless_of creed or color , could set_forth boldly their religious convictions and bear_witness to the power of faith to solve the endless problems of live . 
the businessman be raymond_thornburg . 
the minister be norman_vincent_peale . 
neither have any publishing experience , but they have faith in their idea . 
they borrow a typewriter , raise about $ 2000 in contributions , hire a secretary , persuade a_couple_of young_men to join them for almost_no pay and begin mail_out a collection of unstapled leaflets that they call guideposts . 
compare to the big , established magazines , my first efforts seem feeble indeed . 
but from the start they have two important ingredients : sincerity and realism . 
the people who tell the stories be sincere . 
and the stories they tell be true . 
for_example , early in my life , when one of my editorial workers want to find_out how churches and philanthropic organizations meet the needs of new_york 's down-and-outers , he did n't just ask questions . 
len_lesourd went and live in the slums as a sidewalk derelict for ten days . 
that be nearly 13 years ago . 
len_lesourd be my executive editor today . 
many_of you be familiar , i be sure , with the story of my early struggles : the fire in january , 1947 , that destroy everything - even our precious list of subscribers . 
the help and sympathy that be forthcoming from everywhere . 
the crisis later_on when debts seem about to overwhelm me . 
that be when a remarkable woman , teresa_durlach , come to my aid - not so_much with money , as with_wisdom and courage . 
`` you 're not live_up_to your own principles '' , she tell my discouraged people . 
`` you 're so preoccupied that you 've let your faith grow dim . 
what do you want - a_hundred_thousand subscribers ? 
visualize them , then , believe you are get them , and you will have them '' ! 
and the 100000 subscribers become a reality . 
and_then 500000 . 
and now a_million january guideposts be in circulation . 
with our growth come expansion into new fields of service . 
today more_than a_thousand industries distribute me to their employees . 
they say all personnel have spiritual needs which guideposts help to meet . 
hundreds of civic clubs , business_firms and individuals make me available to school_teachers throughout the land . 
they say it help them bring_back into schools the spiritual and moral values on_which this country was build . 
thousands of free copies are send each_month to chaplains in the armed_forces , to prison libraries and to hospitals everywhere . 
bedridden people say i be easy to hold - and read . 
three years ago it become possible to finance a braille edition for blind readers . 
throughout these exciting years i have be fortunate for , although i have never offer great financial inducements , talent has find its way to me : william_boal who so ably organize business operations ; john_beach who guide circulation ; irving_granville and nelson_rector who travel widely call_on business_firms . 
search for the best in spiritual stories , my roving editors cover not_only the country , but the whole world . 
glenn_kittler has be twice to africa , once spend a week with dr._albert_schweitzer . 
last summer john and elizabeth_sherrill be in alaska . 
van_varner recently return from russia . 
twice a month the editorial staff meet in new_york for an early supper , then a long evening of idea-exchange . 
around the table sit protestant , catholic , and jew . 
each contribute something different , and something important : ruth_peale , her wide experience in church work ; sidney_fields , years of experience as a new_york columnist ; catherine_marshall_lesourd the insight that has make her books world-famous and norm_mullendore , the keen perception of an advertising executive . 
there be people who travel long distances to assure my continued existence . 
elaine st._johns may fly in from the west_coast for the editorial staff meetings . 
starr_jones get_up every morning at five o ' clock , milk his family cow , attend to farm chores , and_then take a two-hour train trip to new_york . 
arthur_gordon come once a month all_the_way from georgia . 
we have also see the power of faith at_work among us . 
rose_weiss , who handle all the prayer-requests that we receive , answer each letter personally , have the serene selflessness that come from suffer : 
she has have many major operations , and now get_about in a limited way on braces and crutches . 
recently , john_sherrill be stricken with one of the deadliest forms of cancer . 
we pray for john , during surgery , we ask others to pray ; all_over the country a massive shield of prayer was throw around him . 
today the cancer be gone . 
perhaps it be not fair to mention some people without mention all . 
but , you see , those who are not mention will not resent it . 
that be the kind_of people they be . 
perhaps you think the editorial meetings be solemn affairs , a_little sanctimonious ? 
not so . 
serious , yes , but also much laughter . 
sharp division of opinion , too , and strenuous debate . 
there be brain-wracking searches for the right word , the best phrase , the_most helpful idea . 
and there be also something intangible that hover around the table . 
a good_word for it be fellowship . 
a shorter word be love . 
each meeting start with a prayer , offer spontaneously by one member of the group . 
it take many forms , this prayer , but in_essence it be always a request for guidance , for open minds and gentle hearts , for honesty and sincerity , for the wisdom and the insights that will help guideposts ' readers . 
for you , readers , be an all-important part of the spiritual experiment that be guideposts . 
i need your support , your criticism , your encouragement , your prayers . 
i be a magazine ; my name be guideposts . 
my message , today , be the same as it be 15 years ago : that there be goodness in people , and strength and love in god . 
may he bless you all . 
havana be filled with an excitement which you could see in the brightness of men 's eyes and hear in the pitch of their voices . 
the hated dictator batista had flee . 
rumors fly from lip to lip that fidel_castro be on_his_way to havana , come from the mountains where he had fight batista for five years . 
already the city be filled with barbudos , the bearded , war-dirty revolutionaries , carry carbines , wave to the crowds that line the prado . 
and_then castro himself did come , bearded , smiling ; yet if you look closely you 'd see that his eyes did not pick_up the smile on his lips . 
at_first i be happy to throw the support of our newspaper behind this man . 
i be sure that castro be happy , too , about that support . 
diario de la marina be the oldest and most influential paper in cuba , with a reputation for speak out against tyranny . 
my grandfather had been stone because of his editorials . 
my own earliest memories be of exiles : my three brothers and i were take often to the united_states `` to visit relatives '' while my father stay_on to fight the dictator machado . 
when it be my turn , i , too , print the truth as i know it about batista , and rejoice to see his regime topple . 
none of us be aware that the biggest fight be still ahead . 
i be full of hope as fidel_castro come into havana . 
within a week , however , i begin to suspect that something be wrong . 
for castro was bring cuba not freedom , but hatred . 
he spend long hours before the tv spit_out promises of revenge . 
he show us how he deal with his enemies : he execute them before tv cameras . 
on home sets children were watch the death throes of men who were shoot before the paredon , the firing wall . 
castro 's reforms ? 
he seem bent_on couple them with vengeance . 
new schools were rise , but with this go_with a harsh proclamation : any academic_degree earn during batista 's regime be invalid . 
economic aid ? 
he had promise cheaper housing : arbitrarily he cut all rents in half , whether the landlord be a millionaire speculator or a widow whose only income be the rental of a spare room . 
under another law , hundreds of farms were seize . 
farm_workers had their wages cut almost in half . 
of_this , only 50 cents a day was pay in cash , the rest in script usable only in `` people 's stores '' . 
a suspicion was grow that fidel_castro be a communist . 
in my mind , i begin to review : his use of hate to gain support ; his people 's courts ; his division of society into two classes , one the hero , the other the villain . 
but most disturbing of all be the advisers he call to sit with him in the palace ; many come from communist countries . 
what should i do about it , i ask myself ? 
i had watch castro handle his enemies before the paredon . 
there be no_doubt in my mind that if i cross him , mobs would appear outside our windows shout `` paredon ! 
paredon '' ! 
what should i do ? 
i be proud of the new buildings which house diario now : the rotogravures , gleam behind glass doors ; the thump and whir of our new presses . 
here be a powerful , ready-made medium , but it could speak only if i tell it to . 
then one_day , early in january , 1960 , i sit_down at my desk , and suddenly i be aware_of the crucifix . 
it be a simple ivory crucifix which my mother had give me . 
i had mount it on velvet and hang it over my desk to remind me always to use the power of the paper in a christian manner . 
now it seem almost as if jesus were look down at me with sadness in his eyes , say : 
`` you will lose the paper . 
you may lose your life . 
but do you have any choice '' ? 
i know in_that moment that i did not have any choice . 
from_that day on i begin to write editorials about the things i did not think correct in fidel_castro 's regime . 
five , four , three , two , one , fire ! 
the tremendous energy release by giant rocket_engines perhaps can be feel much better than it can be hear . 
the pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the_pit of your stomach . 
never before has the introduction of a weapon cause so_much apprehension and fear . 
nuclear_weapons be fearsome , but the long-range ballistic_missile give them a stealth and merciless swiftness which be much more terrifying . 
a great many writers are bewitch by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker would have if he were to strike with complete surprise use nuclear rockets . 
it be relatively easy to go a step further and reason that an attacker , in possession of such absolute power , would simultaneously destroy his opponent 's cities and people . 
with a nation defenseless before it , why would the attacker spare the victim 's people ? 
would n't the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical act of complete subjugation ? 
the nation would be utterly devastate . 
the will of its people , so crucial in_time of peril , would be break . 
nuclear_weapons have give the world the means for self-destruction in hours or days ; and now rockets have give it the means to destroy itself in minutes . 
at this point it should be painfully obvious that cities , be `` soft '' , and the people within them be ideally suited to destruction by nuclear_weapons . 
however , because this vulnerability be mutual , it be to the advantage of neither side to destroy the opponent 's cities , at_least so_long as the opponent have nuclear_weapons with which to effect reprisal . 
it should be appallingly apparent that city-trading be not a profitable military tactic . 
icbms have give us a capability which could be use in two different ways . 
they could be use to attack a nation 's people ( which would inevitably mean the loss of the attacker 's own people ) , or they could be use with discrimination to destroy the enemy 's military_force . 
if our national interest lie_in be able_to fight and win a war rather_than commit national suicide , then we must take a much more penetrating look at ballistic_missiles . 
we must determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves . 
we must make certain that the aircraft be finished before we give the entire job to the missile . 
missiles be very valuable weapons , but they also have their too little known limitations . 
because of a missile 's ballistic_trajectory , the location of a fixed target must be know quite accurately . 
place missiles in submarines , on barges , railroads , highways , surface vessels and in_the_air provide them with passive protection by take_advantage of the gravest weakness of long-range ballistic_missiles today - the extreme difficulty of destroy a mobile or moving target with such weapons . 
one must first detect a fleeting mobile or moving target , decide that it be worthy of destruction , select the missile to be fire against the target , compute ballistics for the flight , and prepare the missile for fire . 
even if all these operations could be_performed instantaneously , the icbm still have a time of flight to the target of about 30_minutes . 
therefore , if the target can significantly change its location in something less_than 30_minutes , the probability of having destroy it is drastically lower . 
because of_this , it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic missiles will seek self-protection in mobility - at_least until missile defenses are perfect which have an exceedingly high kill probability . 
in_order_to destroy the enemy 's mobile , moving , or imprecisely located strategic forces , we must have a hunter-killer capability in_addition to our missiles . 
until this hunter-killer operation can be_performed by spacecraft , manned aircraft appear to be the only means available to us . 
it seem reasonable that if general nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burn each other 's citizens to cinders , we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance aircraft capable_of go_into china or russia to find and destroy their strategic forces which continue to threaten us . 
let us suppose the russians decide to build a rail-mobile icbm force . 
it be entirely feasible to employ aircraft such_as the b-52 or b-70 in hunter-killer operations against soviet railway-based missiles . 
if we stop think in_terms_of tremendous multimegaton nuclear_weapons and consider employ much smaller nuclear_weapons which may be more appropriate for most important military targets , it would seem that the b-52 or b-70 could carry a great many small nuclear_weapons . 
an aircraft with a load of small nuclear_weapons could very conceivably be give a mission to suppress all trains operate within a specified geographic_area of russia - provide that we had use some of our icbms to degrade russia 's air_defenses before our bombers get there . 
the aircraft could be use to destroy other mobile , fleeting , and imprecisely located targets as_well as the known , fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroy by missile . 
why , then , are n't we plan a larger , more important role for manned military aircraft ? 
is there any other way to do the job ? 
survivability of our strategic forces ( polaris , mobile and hardened minuteman , hardened atlas and titan , and airborne skybolt ) mean that it will take some time , perhaps weeks , to destroy a strategic force . 
war , under these circumstances , cannot be one massive exchange of nuclear devastation . 
forces will survive a surprise_attack , and these forces will give depth , or considerable duration , to the conflict . 
the forces which survive the initial attack must be_found and destroy . 
even mobile forces must be_found and destroy . 
but , how does one go_about the job of find and destroy mobile forces ? 
they be not susceptible_to wholesale destruction by ballistic_missile . 
some_day , many years in_the_future , true spacecraft will be able_to find and destroy mobile targets . 
but until we have an effective spacecraft , the answer to the hunter-killer problem be manned aircraft . 
however , the aircraft which we have today are tie to large , `` soft '' airfields . 
nuclear rockets can destroy airfields with ease . 
here then be our problem : aircraft be vital to win a war today because they can perform those missions which a missile be totally incapable_of perform ; but the airfield , on_which the aircraft be completely dependent , is doom by the missile . 
this make today 's aircraft a one-shot , or one mission , weapon . 
aircraft be mighty expensive if you can use them only once . 
this be the point on_which so many people have write_off the aircraft in favor of the missile . 
but remember this - it be n't the aircraft which be vulnerable to nuclear rockets , it be the airfield . 
eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on_the_ground and you have essentially eliminate its vulnerability to long-range ballistic_missiles . 
there be four rather obvious ways to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on_the_ground : 
put aircraft in `` bomb-proof '' hangars when they be on_the_ground . 
build long-range aircraft which can take_off from small ( 3000 - foot ) airfields with runways . 
if we could use all the small airfields we have in_this country , we could disperse our strategic aircraft by a factor of 10 or more . 
use nuclear propulsions to keep our long-range military aircraft in_the_air for the majority of their useful life . 
use very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines , develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing ( vtol ) long-range military aircraft . 
we have the technology today with which to build aircraft shelters which could withstand at_least 200 psi . 
we could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters . 
large , long-range bombers can be develop which would have the capability to take_off from 3000 - foot runways , but they would require more powerful engines than we have today . 
there be little enthusiasm for spend money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous_belief that the aircraft has been make obsolete by the missile . 
this same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has result in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft . 
one seldom hear the analogy `` nuclear propulsion will do for the aircraft what it has already do for the submarine '' . 
if , for_some_reason such_as economy , we are not going_to develop aircraft nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency , then we should turn_to our effort to develop jet_engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 12 or 15 to one . 
with powerplants such_as these , vertical takeoff and landing combat aircraft could be build . 
for_example , a 12 - to-one engine would power a supersonic vtol fighter . 
with a 15 - to-one engine , a supersonic aircraft weigh 300000 pounds could rise vertically . 
the reason that we are not go_ahead full speed to develop high thrust-to-weight engines be that it would cost perhaps a_billion dollars - and you do n't spend that sort_of money if aircraft be obsolete . 
when aircraft be no_longer helpless on airfields , they be no_longer vulnerable to icbms . 
if our sac bombers be , today , capable_of survive a surprise missile attack and because of infinite dispersion or long endurance have the capability to strike at russia again , and again , and again , those bombers would unquestionably assure our military dominance . 
we would have the means to seek_out and destroy the enemy 's force - whether it be fixed or mobile . 
with such a force of manned bombers we could bring enormous pressure to bear_on an enemy , and this pressure would be selective and extremely discriminating . 
no need to kill an entire city and all its people because we lack the precision and reconnaissance to selectively disarm the enemy 's military_force . 
our first necessity , at the very outset of war , be post-attack reconnaissance . 
in a_few years we will have samos ( semiautomatic missile observation system ) . 
but in the case of moving targets , and targets which have limited mobility , what will their location be when it be time to destroy them ? 
what targets have we successfully knock_out ? 
a ballistic_missile cannot , today , tell you if it be successful or unsuccessful . 
what targets still remain to be hit ? 
these crucial questions must be answer by post-attack reconnaissance . 
samos will be hard_put to see through clouds - and to see in the dark . 
even if this be some_day possible , there remain the 30 - minute time of flight of a missile to its overseas target . 
if the target can change its position significantly during the 30_minutes the missile be in_the_air on its way , the probability of the missile destroy the target is drastically reduce . 
pre-attack reconnaissance be vital but only post-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate the war favorably . 
it would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather that post-attack reconnaissance . 
it could operate under the clouds and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night . 
it would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately destroy any targets it discover - no need to wait for a missile to come all_the_way from the united_states with the chance that the target , if it be mobile , would be gone . 
a large aircraft , such_as the b-52 or b-70 , could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small nuclear_weapons . 
few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive power will create 1000 psi overpressure at 100 feet . 
or put another way , the hardest missile site plan today could be destroy by place a one-kiloton warhead ( 1 20 th the size of those use in hiroshima and nagasaki ) within 100 to 200 feet of the target ! 
it be our lack of extreme accuracy which force the use of very large yield nuclear_weapons . 
today we have side-looking radar which have such high resolution that the radar picture clearly show individual buildings , runways , taxi-ways , separate spans of bridges , etc. . 
with these keen `` eyes '' and small nuclear_weapons deliver with accuracy , military_forces can be directly attack with minimum damage to urban_areas . 
if we fail to develop the means to hunt_down and destroy the enemy 's military_force with extreme care and precision , and if war come in spite of our most ardent desires for peace , our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening . 
at the westminster_kc dog_show in madison_square_garden , new_york on the second day , the finals of the junior_class bring_out the_most competitive competition in the history of_this class . 
the class have entries from as far west as wisconsin and as far south as kentucky . 
this year several entries from canada were enter which make the junior_class international . 
forty-six of the 53 juniors who mail in entries be present . 
it be interesting to note that many_of these juniors were show dogs in various other classes at the show prior to the finals of the junior_class . 
as has be the custom for the past several years , john_cross , jr. , bench_show_chmn. of westminster , arrange for the juniors ' meeting before the class , and invite two speakers from the dog world to address them . 
over 60 juniors , parents and guests attend . 
after the juniors were welcome and congratulate for qualify for the finals of the junior_class , mrs._william_h._long , jr. was introduce as the first speaker . 
in her opening remarks mrs._long also welcome the juniors and state , `` there is n't any other show quite like westminster . 
i know because this be my 37 th year with hardly_a break . 
mrs._long still feel the same unique spirit of westminster which she state the present juniors will experience today but probably will not appreciate in full for a_number_of years . 
twenty years ago her daughter betsey_long , then 13 years of_age , win the grand_challenge_trophy , children 's handling class ( as they were_called then ) at westminster . 
no sooner had betsey come_out of the ring than mrs._long walk into the working competition with ch. cadet or noranda , another home-bred product , and win ! 
speak from long years of experience , mrs._long advise the juniors : `` when show dogs cease to be fun and excitement , stop ! 
dogs have a way of sense our feelings ! 
when you and your dog step into the junior ring , it should be just what the dog want to do as much_as what you want him to do . 
if you walk into the ring because it be fun to show your dog , he will feel it and give you a good performance ! 
he know your signals , what is expect of him and the way the class is conduct , right up through the flash-bulbs of the photographers '' . 
`` take_away your attitude '' , say mrs._long , `` and what have you leave ? 
either a nervous dog because you be livid with rage - a sure sign that you are take things too seriously and had_better stop ! 
or a bored dog because you be more interested in something else - maybe the way you look , or the date you have after the class , or you are just do this to please the parents . 
`` the reason you be in the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the_most attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can produce . 
aids sound more like a pony_club , or horsemanship classes - ride a horse and show a dog be very similar ! 
`` your aids be your attitude , which come through your voice , your hands and legs - voice to encourage , discourage or whatever the need may be ; hands to guide or restrain ; legs to produce motion and rate of speed . 
without right attitude the other aids just do not work right '' . 
mrs._long wish all the juniors luck in the class and state , `` have fun ! 
and may you all continue to show at westminster in the years to come '' ! 
the second speaker be harvey_barcus , president of the dog_writers ass ' n of america . 
mr._barcus speak on the subject of scholarships for juniors - with which he be very familiar . 
last year a boy he know and help in journalism win the thoroughbred_racing ass ' n scholarship which be worth $ 10000 . 
he give a resume of the steps take in order for the boy he sponsor to win the scholarship . 
`` junior showmanship be an extremely worthy project and should be earnestly encourage '' ! be one of mr._barcus ' strong_beliefs . 
he feel very forcibly that the american_kennel_club should take_part a more active part in encourage the junior division ! 
in closing , mr._barcus also wish all the juniors luck in their class . 
instead of 3 a. m. in_the_past , the juniors_class at westminster was hold at 4 : 45 p. m. . 
this give the juniors the use of the entire ring at the show - a great advantage to them ! 
before the juniors enter the ring the steward announce that after_all juniors had move their dogs around the ring and set_up them up , they could relax with their dogs . 
from there on , each junior was going_to be judge individually . 
this thoughtful gesture be well received by the juniors as the class have an entry of 46 juniors and it take approximately one hour , 45 minutes to judge the class . 
this year anne_hone_rogers , outstanding handler , judge the class . 
this be the third time in 28 years of junior showmanship at westminster that a lady handler has judge the class . 
as the juniors enter the ring , mr._spring , the announcer , state over the public-address system that this be the 28 th year that westminster has hold the finals of the junior competition . 
juniors compete last year at american_kennel_club and canadian kennel_club recognized shows to be eligible to compete in_this class - the finals for the year . 
a junior who win two or more wins in_the_open class be eligible . 
( the purpose of the junior showmanship competition be to teach and encourage juniors to become good sportsmen . 
many adults show at westminster today be products of_this class . ) 
it seem an almost impossible job for miss_rogers to select 4 winners from the 46 juniors enter . 
a large_number of these juniors have 7 and 8 wins to their credit and be seasoned campaigners . 
after the judge move all the dogs individually , she select several from the group and place them in_the_center of the ring . 
she then go_over them thoroughly give each a strenuous test in showmanship . 
betty_lou_ham , age 16 , holyoke , mass. , show an irish_setter , was choose as international_champion of the year . 
she was_awarded the professional_handlers ' ass ' ns ' leonard_brumby , sr._memorial_trophy ( name for the founder-originator of the junior_classes . ) 
betty be 16 years of_age and have several wins to her credit last year . 
in_addition to show an irish_setter throughout the year , she also score with an afghan . 
sydney_le_blanc , age 15 , staten_island , n._y. , show a doberman_pinscher , be 2 nd . 
susan_hackmann , age 14 , from baltimore , md. , show a dachshund , be 3 rd . 
last year susan also place 3 rd in the finals at westminster . 
from the records we keep - susan be the only junior who has place in the junior_classes in both united_states and canada . 
karen_marcmann , age 16 , trapp , penna. , show a keeshond be 4 th . 
most juniors who were enter in the finals be seasoned campaigners and not_only show and win in junior_classes but score in the breed classes as_well . 
in 1960 , there be 7287 entries in the junior_classes . 
each_year these shows have increase in entries . 
next year 1962 , at westminster , the bench_show_committee has raise the requirements so_that a junior must win 3 or more junior_classes in_the_open division only to qualify for westminster . 
percy_roberts , a leading judge will not be at the international_show this year for the junior judging contest as he has been invite to judge in australia in march . 
it has been suggest many_times that a class be set_up for the juniors who be overage and cannot enter the junior_classes . 
for_some_time this writer has been suggest a junior judging class for intermediates over 16 and under 20 years of_age who be ineligible to compete in the junior_class . 
such a class was try_out successfully at the westchester_kc_show recently . 
not_only were the contestants please with the class , but it arouse the interest of all_in attendance that day . 
the intermediates in the class with the judge were ask to pick 4 winners and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice of the judge . 
we suggest this class in the horse world and it was accept immediately and include in the programs of horse_shows at the recent horse_show convention in new_york it was state that this intermediate_judging_class is meeting_with great success and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world . 
this class can be just_as successful in the dog world if it is give a chance . 
last year robert_harris , a leading junior handler enter the dog_judging_contest ( junior ) at the international_kc of chicago show and have the highest score in judging of any junior since the class ' inception . 
juniors who attend this chicago show should make a point to enter this class as it would be of great help to them . 
superintendents at dog_shows state it is become more difficult to obtain a licensed handler to judge junior showmanship competition . 
the founder of the junior showmanship competition the late leonard_brumby , sr. ( for whom the trophy is name after at westminster ) be an outstanding handler and believe a junior should have an opportunity to exhibit in a dog_show start with the junior showmanship division . 
some years ago this class was judge by celebrities who know nothing of_what was require of a junior 's ability to show a dog . 
to overcome this unfair judging , the a._k._c. require that a licensed handler be present to judge the class . 
if the superintendents do not receive more cooperation from handlers , it has been suggest that licensed judges also be qualify to judge this class . 
by recognize and help juniors get interested in the dog world , all will be help to create future dog owners . 
the airedale_terrier club of america and the kerry_blue_terrier club of america have under_consideration donate trophies to the boys or girls who win with their breeds in junior showmanship competition at any show . 
the kansas_city and the topeka kcs are arrange that juniors who win at their shows will be qualified to win points for westminster . 
the rio_grande kc is also consider have their junior_classes set_up so_that juniors can qualify with points for westminster . 
the american_pointer_club is still continue to donate a trophies to juniors who win at junior showmanship classes with pointers . 
travel through the south - over 16000 miles - with two great_danes , an afghan , and a persian kitten , we 've work_up a regular routine for acceptance at motels . 
my husband enter the motel office , sign_up for a room , and them solemnly ask the proprieter if he accept pets . 
`` puppies '' ? come the suspicious question . 
`` no '' , he reply , `` full grown , adult show dogs , housebroken , and obedience-trained '' . 
we 've never been refuse ! 
once settle , we be careful to walk the dogs in an out_of_the_way spot , keep them under_control in the room , and feed and bench them where they can n't do any harm to the furnishings or the furniture . 
in the morning we leave the room look as neat as a pin ! 
many_a motel owner - when we 've stop there again - has remember us and has say he prefer our dogs to most children . 
so many_times i have wonder why veterinarians do not wipe the table clean before each new canine patient is place on_it for examination . 
is it that they do n't care ? 
are they indifferent_to the fact that the dog can easily pick_up germs from the preceding patient ? 
at_one_time , to most americans , unless they be fortunate enough to live near a body of navigable water , boats were consider the sole concern of fishermen , rich people , and the united_states navy . 
today the recreational boating scene be awash with heartening statistics which prove the enormous growth of_that sport . 
there be more_than 8000000 recreational boats in_use in the united_states with almost 10000000 the prediction for within the next decade . 
about 40000000 people participate in boating in 1960 . 
boating has become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining sea . 
boats are operate in every state in the union , with the heaviest concentrations along both coasts and in_the_middle west . 
the spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating be markedly evident , expectedly , in the areas where boats have always been find : the natural lakes , rivers , and along the nation 's coastline . 
but during the last several years boats were launch in areas where , a short_time ago , the only water to be find be in wells and water troughs for livestock . 
develop as a result of the multi-purpose resources control program of the government , vast , man-made bodies_of_water represent a kind_of glorious fringe_benefit , provide boating and fishing havens all_over the country . 
no_matter_how determined or wealthy boating lovers of the southwest had be , for_example , they could never have create anything approach the fifty square-mile lake_texoma , located between texas and oklahoma , which result when the corp of army_engineers dam the red_river . 
in 1959 , accord to the engineers , lake_texoma be only one of thirty-two artificial_lakes and reservoirs which were use for recreation by over 1000000 persons . 
where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been create by bring bodies_of_water to the people , means have been find to take the people and their boats to the water . 
provide these means are_about ninety companies which manufacture the estimated 1800000 boat trailers now in_use . 
it be a simple task to haul a boat fifty or one_hundred miles to a lake or reservoir on the new , light , strong , easy-to-operate trailers which are_built to accommodate almost any kind_of small_boat and retail from $ 100 to $ 2000 . 
the sight of sleek inboards , outboards , and sailboats being wheel smartly along highways many miles from any water be commonplace . 
boatmen lucky enough to have facilities for year ' round anchorage for their craft , will recall the tedious procedure of load their gear into the car , drive to the water , and make trip after trip to transfer the gear to the boat . 
today , the boat , on its trailer , is bring to the gear and load at the door . 
arrive_at the waterside , the boat is launch , the family take aboard and , that easily , another day afloat is begin . 
and trailers for boats be not what they start_out to be ten years ago . 
this year , americans will discover previously unheard of refinements in trailers that will be exhibit in about one_hundred of our nation 's national , regional and local boat shows . 
the boats of america 's trailer sailors in 1961 will be coddle on clouds as they are haul to new horizons . 
the variety of craft on the country 's waters today be overwhelming . 
they range from an eight-foot pram , which you can build yourself for less_than $ 50 , to auxiliary sailboats which can cost over $ 100000 . 
boat prices vary accord to the buyer 's desires or needs . 
in_this respect , boats can be compare with houses . 
there be no limit to what you can spend , yet it be easily possible to keep within a set budget . 
there be no question as to just what be available . 
you name it , our industry is produce it , and it probably is make in different models . 
there be canoes ideal for fishing in protected waters or for camping trips . 
there be houseboats which be literally homes afloat , accommodate whole families in comfort and convenience . 
you can cross an ocean in a fully equipped craft , sail , power , or both , or laze away a fine day in a small dinghy on a local pond . 
you may have your boat of wood , canvas , plywood , plastic , or metal . 
you may order utility models , inboard or outboard , with or without toilets , galleys , and bunks . 
you may dress_up it up with any number of accessories or keep it as simple as you choose . 
designers and manufacturers have produce models for purchasers who run the gamut from a nautical version of the elderly pasadena lady who never drive more_than five miles an hour on her once-a-month ride around the block , to the sportiest boatman who insist on all the dash , color , flair and speed possible to encompass in a single boat . 
you pay your money and you take your choice . 
american technology in engine and hull design be largely responsible_for the plentiful interest in american boating . 
i wonder if anyone ever bother to make the point that when it come_to boats and their motors , americans excel over any country in the world in_the_long_run . 
russia , whose technology be not_quite primitive , be still in the dark_ages when it come_to improve the outboard_motor , for_instance . 
now here be truly a marvel . 
the outboard engine of today have a phenomenal range of one to 80 horsepower , unheard of a_few years ago for a two cycle engine in quantity production . 
these engines can be remove from a boat with relative ease , wherein lie their greatest advantage . 
their cost be not beyond the hopes of the american pocketbook , the range be about $ 150 to $ 1000 , depending_on size . 
great thought has been give to make life easier for the growing boating population of the country ; and to make the owning of a boat simpler . 
there be a time when , if a man want to purchase a boat , it be necessary for him to be able to produce a sizeable amount of cash before he could touch the tiller or wheel . 
having a boat finance through a local bank is do much the same way as an automobile loan is extend . 
marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in non-dealer areas cooperate in enable you to launch now and pay later . 
terms range from one to five years and the interest_rates and down_payments run about the same as for automobiles . 
of_course , individual financing arrangements depend_on a good_deal on the purchaser 's earn power , credit rating and local bank policy . 
outboard_motors , insurance , and boat repairs may also be finance in the same way as boats . 
terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those for home_appliances . 
when the automobile be in its embryonic stage , such roads as exist be pretty_much open roads with the tacit understanding that horses should not be unduly terrify be about the only rule govern where , when and_how fast a car could go . 
when air_travel be in its infancy , the sky was consider big enough and high enough for all . 
man have enough to worry about manage to get up there and stay without be burdened with rules once aloft . 
it be much the same with pleasure boating at_first . 
come one , come all , the water 's fine ! 
as the ungoverned days of the automobile and the airplane be long_since relegate to the past , so be the carefree attitude toward what a boatman may and may_not do ; must and should do . 
however , there be a minimum of legislative restriction on boating . 
laws on boating vary accord to the state in_which the craft is to be use and accord to its horsepower . 
what may be acceptable in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary_line . 
the main requirement be to be sure the boat be number accord to the regulations of the state in_which the boat will be principally use . 
if your state have no provisions for the numbering of pleasure_boats , you must apply for a number from the u._s._coast_guard for any kind_of boat with mechanical propulsion rate at more_than 10 horsepower before it can be use on federal waterways . 
state numbering laws differ from each other in many ways . 
fees be not the same and some states do not require certain craft , such_as sailboats with no power , to be register at_all . 
many states have laws regulate the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age of motor boat operators . 
generally , states reserve for communities the right to have local ordinances regulate speed and other activities . 
it be always wise_to consult your marine dealer , local yacht or boat club secretary , or local law_enforcement officers if you be not positive what the regulations be . 
ignorance of the law be no better excuse on the water than it be on land ; lack of ability and common_sense can lead to just_as much tragedy . 
hand_in_hand with the legislative program be the industry 's self originate and directed safety program . 
foresee the possible threats to safety with the rapid_growth of the sport , the industry has been support an intense , coordinated educational program with great success since 1947 . 
a primary factor in the success of the safety program has be the enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers . 
the industry has be its own watch dog . 
with u._s._coast_guard cooperation , the american_boat and yacht_council was form to develop recommended practices and standards for boats and their equipment with_reference_to safety . 
industry interest in safety go even farther . 
in 1959 , the yacht_safety_bureau was reorganize by the national_association of engine and boat manufacturers and a group of insurance underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and label service for boats and their equipment . 
a new waterfront site for the bureau is now being build at atlantic_city , new_jersey , to provide the_most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the sport safe . 
in_addition to these activities , the naebm , with headquarters at 420 lexington avenue , new_york_city , as_well as other associations and individual manufacturers , provide and distribute films , booklets , and public_services in regard_to proper boat handling and safety afloat . 
it be important to note the work of the united_states power_squadrons and the u._s._coast_guard_auxiliary . 
each of these fine groups give free boating classes in seamanship piloting and small_boat handling . 
these be not governmentally subsidized organizations . 
this year , over 100000 persons will receive this free instruction . 
as america on wheels be responsible_for an industry of motor courts , motels , and drive-in establishments where you can dine , see a movie , shop , or make a bank_deposit , the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have spark industries design especially to accommodate them . 
instead of motels , for the boatman there be marinas . 
the word marina was coin by naebm originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational boats could find protection and basic needs to lay_over in relative comfort . 
currently , marina is use to indicate a municipal or commercially operate facility where a pleasure_boat may dock and find some or all_of the following available : gasoline , fresh water , electricity , telephone_service , ice , repair facilities , restaurants , sleep accommodations , a general_store , and a grocery_store . 
yachtel , a relatively new word , indicate a waterfront type of hotel where a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises as_well as other services . 
boatel have a similar meaning to yachtel . 
it indicate the same thing but it be mean to pertain more specifically to establishments design to cater to smaller type boats such_as outboards . 
regardless_of nomenclature , yachtels and boatels be marinas . 
boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities may rightfully be call marinas . 
a recent survey disclose there be about 4000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and boatyards in the united_states , the majority of_which be equipped to handle outboard boats . 
the design of a mechanical interlocking frame be much like a mechanical puzzle , but once understand , the principles can be apply to any track and signal arrangement . 
in the frame be two sets of bars which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous moves . 
the main set of bars be the `` tappets '' and one tappet is connected to each lever . 
if the lever is pull to clear a signal or move a switch , the tappet move a short distance lengthwise at_the_same_time . 
close behind the plane of the tappets be the locking bars . 
these can also move a short distance but at right_angles to the tappets . 
the number of locking bars require depend_on how many false moves must be prevent . 
in the sides of the tappets be notches with sloping sides , and connection between the tappets and locking bars consist_of cams call `` dogs '' . 
two or more dogs are mount on each locking bar . 
these slide into and out of the notches in the tappets as the tappets are move , lock and unlock them . 
here 's how the scheme work : suppose the operator pull the lever to clear a particular signal . 
this also pull the tappet connected to the particular lever and force any dogs seated in the notches to_the_side , thus move one or more locking bars . 
the dogs on the other ends of these locking bars are thus force into notches in other tappets . 
by this scheme , pull one signal to clear lock all the other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal is again restore to normal . 
interlocking signals be normally at stop or `` red '' position , and a lever must be pull to `` clear '' the signal . 
this be not necessarily to green , however , for in some situations only a yellow indication is give to a train to let it into the `` plant '' . 
there be other basic rules . 
a turnout may have two levers , one to actually move the switch points , the other to lock the points . 
a signal cannot be clear until all the related turnouts are properly throw and lock . 
such locks are nearly always use where the switch points `` face '' oncoming traffic . 
the lock insure that the points are throw all_the_way with no chance that a wheel flange will snag on a partly throw point . 
if the points are n't throw all_the_way , the turnout cannot be lock , and in_turn , the signal cannot be clear . 
generally , these locks on turnouts are_called `` facing point locks '' . 
figs. 1 - 6 show typical arrangements of track and signals . 
each diagram is accompany by a `` dog chart '' , a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular lever will lock if pull . 
the lines connect the wedge-shaped dogs represent the locking bars at right_angles to the tappet bars . 
by study the track-signal diagrams you 'll note several other details . 
derails - mechanical track devices that actually guide the wheels off the rails if a train pass a `` stop '' signal - are use in many instances . 
`` home '' signals have two blades . 
the blacked-in blades indicate a fixed aspect - the blade does not move . 
as an engineer approach the plant the position of the home signal is see in_advance when he pass the `` distant '' signal located beyond the limits of the interlocking plant . 
in some low-speed situations , the distant signal is_fixed at caution . 
in other instances where there be no automatic block signaling , the distant have only green and yellow aspects . 
so_much for the prototype . 
the interlocking frame we build at the model railroader workshop and_then instal on paul_larson 's railroad follow the fig. 1 scheme and is_shown begin in fig. 7 , page 65 , and in the photos . 
here 's how it can be build . 
the sizes of pieces needed for the interlocking frame are_shown in the notes within fig. 7 , most_of the bars be 1 8 '' brass in 1 4 '' and 1 2 '' widths . 
you may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers and locks as you wish . 
our instructions assume you are build this particular frame , which be for a junction . 
when cut the pieces , dress the ends smooth , and square with a smooth file or sanding disk . 
start with the right-hand piece `` b '' , * * f , solder it to the lower piece `` a '' of the same material but 12 '' long . 
let exactly 1 '' of `` a '' extend beyond `` b '' and use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees . 
now lay 12 pieces of * * f cut 5 - 3 4 '' long side_by_side but separate by 12 pieces of the same material 1 2 '' sq. . 
this give you the spacing for locate the left-hand piece `` b '' . 
compress the assembly when you make the mark to show the location for `` b '' . 
solder this second `` b '' to `` a '' at right_angles . 
there should be 10 '' between the two parallel members and each should be 1 '' from an end of the long piece . 
cap this assembly ( with spacing bars in_place ) with a * * f bar . 
tack solder all the 1 2 '' sq. pieces to the 10 '' and 12 '' members . 
these will be drill and tap later_on . 
now cut five * * f locking bar spacers ( which run horizontally ) . 
position these use six intermediate temporary * * f spacers and locate the upper 12 '' bar `` a '' . 
solder it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame . 
now place 12 pieces 1 2 '' sq. on this edge as we did before and space them with the 5 - 3 4 '' long `` tappets '' , as they are call . 
cap with a * * f bar and tack solder in_place . 
cap the locking bar spacers with two * * f directly under the first two `` b '' pieces . 
remove all the loose spacing bars . 
mark and center_punch all the holes required for screws to hold this assembly together . 
see fig. 7 . 
placement of these holes be not critical , but they should be locate so_that the centers be about 1 8 '' from any edge . 
drill all no. 50 and counter-drill all except the `` a '' pieces size 43 . 
tap the `` a '' pieces 2 - 56 . 
now unsolder and disassemble the frame except for the two 12 '' and the first two 3 - 3 4 '' bars ( `` a '' and `` b '' pieces ) , which are solder together . 
either lay the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters so they may be replace in their proper positions . 
dress all surfaces with a file , clean off all solder and drilling burrs . 
drill 20 no. 47 holes in the upper piece `` a '' as show in fig. 7 . 
tap these 3 - 48 for mount the electrical_contact later_on . 
note 6 and 8 lock levers do n't require holes for contacts . 
now reassemble the frame , use * * f roundhead steel screws and nuts . 
put the 12 tappets and some * * f locking bar spacers in the frame to help align all the components before you tighten the screws . 
be sure the tappets are not pinch by a twisted 1 2 '' sq. spacer . 
as an anchor for the spring lock , insert a * * f bar in the lower left corner of the frame as show in fig. 7 . 
drill a no. 43 hole through the pieces and secure with a 2 - 56 nut and screw . 
drill two no. 50 holes , one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly above it , and tap 2 - 56 . 
number all the tappet bars before remove them so they can be replace in the same slots . 
remove all other loose pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth . 
cut five pieces of * * f brass bar stock 3 - 3 4 '' long . 
these be supporting members for the short locking bars . 
locate their positions in fig. 7 and drill no. 43 to match the corresponding holes in the frame . 
cut_off excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut . 
drill four no .19 and four no. 28 holes in the 12 '' long `` a '' pieces . 
locate the position from fig. 7 . 
draw file no. 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective slot and square the ends . 
break the end corners with a slight 45 degree chamfer . 
drill a no. 50 hole 1 - 1 4 '' from one end and tap 2 - 56 . 
( see fig. 7 . ) 
put a 2 - 56 roundhead screw into the hole , cut_off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar . 
to find the other stop screw position , insert the tappet into the frame and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge . 
scribe a line across the bar on the other end of the tappet , 1 4 '' plus half the diameter of the 2 - 56 screw head ( about 5 64 '' ) away from the frame edge . 
total distance be about 21 64 '' . 
tend to make this dimension slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly 1 4 '' tappet movement . 
drill a no. 50 hole , tap 2 - 56 and insert a roundhead 2 - 56 screw as you did on the first end . 
drill a no. 47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position show in figs. 7 and 8 . 
repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet bars . 
to each tappet except 6 and 8 , solder a * * f piece of brass and file to the tapered shape show in figs .6 and 8 . 
these will serve as lifting pads for the electrical_contacts . 
fit the locking bars and make the locking pieces be a rather tedious job since stop screws , tappets and locking bars must be remove and replace many_times . 
as the work progress the frame and moving parts become a sort_of chinese_puzzle where several pieces must be remove before the part you are work_on be accessible . 
a_little extra work here will pay_off with a smooth , snug-fitting machine when you be finished . 
each completed locking bar should remain in_place as the work progress to insure snug fitting . 
the order of fitting be not too important . 
however , we start with the first row of bars and work our way back . 
since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs and notches is use throughout , we will only describe the construction of one locking bar . 
figs .7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions . 
all the bars are cut from * * f brass . 
the lengths of each piece are list at the bottom of fig. 7 . 
bar `` c '' be 2 - 3 4 '' long . 
draw file the edges , square_up the ends and put a slight chamfer on the edges so they will not snag in the frame . 
fig. 8 give the dimensions for locate the dog-pin holes . 
center_punch and drill the no. 31 hole 7 16 '' from one end of the bar . 
chuck a length of 1 8 '' dia. drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning device and while it is rotate file the end square and_then file a slight taper 1 8 '' long . 
cut the piece about 9 32 '' or 5 16 '' long and drive it into the no .31 hole drill in the lock bar . 
file the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 1 8 '' above the bar . 
this dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3 . 
place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3 . 
scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of tappet 3 , parallel to piece `` a '' . 
see the drawings for the shape of the notch . 
scribe v-shaped lines on the bar and rough_out with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power_tool . 
we use the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about .020 '' thick and 1 '' dia. fitted on a 1 8 '' dia. mandrel . 
such disks be very handy for cutting and shape small parts . 
file to a smooth finish . 
a barrette swiss pattern file be handy since its triangular shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without mar an adjoining one . 
endeavor to get the notches as much alike as possible . 
the notch should have a smooth finish so_that the steel dog will slide easily over it . 
assemble the parts in the frame and test the slide action of the mating pieces . 
all match surfaces should be check frequently and mate on a cut and fit basis . 
chuck a 2 '' or 3 '' piece of 1 8 '' dia. drill rod in a drill press or electric hand_tool . 
fashion a sharp scribing point about 3 64 '' long on one end , use swiss pattern files . 
this tool can also be make with a lathe . 
scientists say that the world and everything in it are base on mathematics . 
without math the men who are continually seek the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go ' round would not have any means of analyze , standardize , and communicate the things they discover and learn . 
math and the formulas that allow it to be apply to different problems be , therefore , essential to any scientific endeavor . 
hot rodding be a science . 
it 's not a science as involved as determine what make the earth rotate on its axis or build a rocket or put a satellite into orbit but it be , nevertheless , a science . 
but because science is base on mathematics does n't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician . 
a guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years without become even remotely involved_with mathematical problems ; however , he will have a clearer understanding of_what he is do and the chances be he will be more successful if he understand the few formulas that apply to rodding . 
a mathematical formula be nothing more_than a pattern for solve a specific problem . 
it place the various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in_relation_to each other so_that the influence of factors on each other can be compute . 
the first_step in use a formula be to insert the numerical_values of the factors involved in their correct positions in the formula . 
this change the formula to an `` equation '' . 
the equation is use for the mathematical_process of solve the problem . 
equations for rodding formulas be not complicated . 
they involve only simple mathematics that are teach in grammar_school arithmetic classes . 
however , it be essential that the various mathematical_symbols use in the equations be_understood so_that the mathematical_processes can be do properly and in their correct order . 
they indicate simple division , multiplication , subtraction , and addition . 
the symbol for division be a straight_line that separate two numbers place one above the other . 
the lower number is always divide into the upper number : 
* * f the symbol for multiplication be `` '' . 
it is use to separate two or more numbers in a row . 
for_example : 
* * f_numbers to be multiply together may be multiply in any order . 
the result will be the same regardless_of the order use . 
the symbol for subtraction be the standard minus_sign . 
this be nothing more_than a dash . 
it separate two or more numbers . 
the number on_the_right of the symbol is always subtract from the number on_the_left of the symbol . 
for_example : * * f when more_than two figures are separate by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carry_out from the left to right if the result be to be correct . 
for_example , for the problem * * f , 10 from 25 equal 15 , then 6 from 15 equal 9 . 
addition is indicate by the + symbol . 
the symbol is use to separate two or more numbers . 
for_example : 
* * f_numbers separate by addition symbols may be place in any order . 
when solve an equation that involve division as_well as other steps , do all the division steps first to reduce those parts of the equation to their numerical_value . 
multiplication , subtraction , and addition can then be accomplish as they appear in the equation by start at the left end of the equation and work toward_the_right . 
complete the division first also include those division parts that require multiplication , subtraction , or addition steps : * * f this would be reduce by multiply 8 times 6 and_then divide the product by 12 . 
this part of the equation would then become 4 . 
for use in formulas , fractions should be convert to their decimal equivalents . 
the easiest way to do this be with a conversion chart . 
charts for this purpose be available from many sources . 
they are include in all types of mathematical handbooks and they are stamp on some types of precision measuring_instruments . 
the various mathematical_processes can be simplify by carry the results to only two or three decimal places . 
shorten the results in this manner will not have any detrimental effect on the accuracy of the final result . 
some formulas contain `` constants '' . 
a constant be a number that remain the same regardless_of the other numbers use in the formula and the resultant equation . 
it be a number without which the equation cannot be solve correctly . 
rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport . 
the answers they give can often pave_the_way to performance increases and , quite often , be necessary for complete entry blanks for different events . 
when it be needed , one formula be as important as another . 
however , some formulas are use more_than others . 
we 'll take them in the general order of their popularity . 
a rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine . 
displacement is sometimes refer to as `` swept volume '' . 
most entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information because of class restrictions . 
it be good to be able to compute displacement so_that changes in it result from boring and stroking can be compute . 
factors involve in the displacement formula be the bore diameter of the engine 's cylinders , the length of the piston stroke , the number of cylinders in the engine , and a constant . 
the constant be .7854 , which be one-quarter of 3.1416 , another constant known_as `` pi '' . 
pi is use in formulas concern with the dimensions of circles . 
actually , the engine displacement formula be the standard formula for compute the volume of a cylinder of any type with an added factor that represent the number of cylinders in the engine . 
the cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determine and_then the volume of the individual cylinders is compute by multiply the area by the stroke length , which be the equivalent of the length of the cylinders . 
multiply the result by the number of cylinders in the engine give the engine 's total displacement . 
the formula be : * * f . 
dimensions in inches , and fractions of inches will give the displacement in cubic_inches . 
dimensions in centimeters and fractions of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic_centimeters ( cc ) . 
one inch equal 2.54 centimeters : one cubic_inch equal 16.38 cubic_centimeters . 
for_example , let 's consider a standard 283 cubic_inch chevy_v8 . 
these engines have a cylinder diameter of 3 - 7 8 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches . 
the formula , with the fractions convert to decimals , become * * f . 
to arrive_at the answer , multiply the numbers together by start at the left of the group and work to the right . 
the different steps will look_like this * * f . 
a cylinder 's compression ratio is compute by compare the cylinder 's volume , or its displacement , with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber . 
cylinder volume can be determine mathematically but combustion chamber volume must be measure with a liquid . 
cylinder volume is determine in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula : * * f . 
to measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers in the cylinder_head , install the valves and spark_plug in the chamber and support the head so_that its gasket surface be level . 
then pour water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill the chamber to its gasket surface . 
do not overfill the chamber . 
this be possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface_tension . 
such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface around the chamber before they will flow_out of the chamber . 
the amount of liquid pour into the chamber is determine by subtract the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber be full from the original quantity . 
most beakers be graduated in cubic_centimeters ( cc ) , make it necessary to convert the result to cubic_inches . 
however , the displacement of the cylinder can be convert to cubic_centimeters . 
the compression ratio arrive_at with the formula will be the same regardless_of whether cubic_inches or cubic_centimeters are use . 
the only precaution be that all volumes use in the formula be quote in the same terms . 
the volume of the cylinder opening in_the_head gasket must be compute by multiply its area in square_inches by the gasket 's thickness in thousandths of an inch . 
sometimes it be necessary to roughly calculate the square_inch area of the opening but the calculation can usually be make with sufficient accuracy that it won n't affect the final computation . 
the volume of the opening is_added to the combustion chamber volume . 
another thing that must be take into consideration be the volume of the area between the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder_block when the piston be in top dead center position . 
compute this volume by measure the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measure device and_then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth . 
the formula for this step be : * * f this volume is_added to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head_gasket opening . 
the total of these three volumes be the `` final combustion chamber volume '' . 
after the factors just describe have been compute , they are apply the following formula : * * f for an example let 's dream_up an engine that have a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic_inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic_inches . 
apply these figures to the formula we get the equation : * * f the compression ratio be 10 to 1 . 
this method of compute compression ratio cannot be use accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly shaped heads . 
any irregularity on the piston heads will make it impossible , with normal means , to determine the final combustion chamber volume because the volume displace by the piston heads cannot be readily compute . 
the only way to determine the final combustion chamber volume when such pistons are use be by measure it with liquid while the cylinder_head be bolt to the cylinder_block and the piston be in top dead center position . 
there be four versions of the formula that involve the relationships of car speed , engine speed , rear axle gear ratio , and rear tire size . 
by use the appropriate version any one of these factors can be determine for any combination of the other three . 
to simplify the formulas a representative symbol is substitute for each of the factors . 
these be mph for car speed rpm for engine crankshaft speed r for rear axle gear ratio w for tire size tire size can be determine in several ways but the one that be the easiest and as accurate as any be by measure the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly . 
this is do by measure the distance from the surface on_which the tire is rest to the center of the rear axle shaft . 
a tire must be inflate to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be load to its operating weight when this measurement is make . 
the measurement must be in inches . 
any fraction of an inch involve in the measurement must be convert to a decimal equivalent_to simplify the mathematics . 
when tire size is measure in_this manner a constant of 168 is use in the formula . 
to determine car speed for a given combination of engine speed , gear ratio , and tire size , the formula be : * * f for an engine speed of 5000 rpm , a gear ratio of 4.00 to 1 , and a tire radius of 13 inches , the equation would look_like this : * * f to determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three factors the formula be : * * f use the same figures as for the previous example , the equation become : * * 
- the best 2 - year-old pacing mile up_to_date at ben_white_raceway has be that of mary_liner ( mainliner-highland_ellen ) , a member of the dick_williams stable , who was clock 2 : 25 . 
she is own by ralph_h._kroening , milwaukee , wis. , who , accord to the railbirds , can feel justly proud_of her . 
other good miles have be by debonnie ( dale_frost-debby_hanover ) and prompt_time ( adios-on_time ) in 2 : 28 - : 36 ; kimberly_gal ( galophone-kimberly_hanover ) 2 : 26.2 ; laguerre_hanover ( tar_heel - lotus_hanover ) and monel ( tar_heel-miracle_byrd ) in 2 : 34 h . 
laguerre_hanover be outstanding in type and conformation - good body , plenty of heart girth , stand straight on his legs on excellent feet - and have the smoothest gait . 
this colt be behind most_of the other 2 - year-olds in the simpson stable but can show about as much pace as any of them . 
monel show improvement with each work-out and look the makings of a good brood mare after win her share of races . 
stardel ( star 's pride-starlette_hanover ) , 2 : 34 h , look quite promising . 
fury_hanover ( hoot_mon-fay ) , caper ( hoot_mon-columbia_hanover ) and isaac ( hoot_mon-goddess_hanover ) have been work together but have not equal their best work do some weeks ago . 
fury and caper work in 2 : 35 h and did it with ease . 
they be two good colts of different type . 
fury be upstanding and on the rangy side , and caper be more the compact type . 
i have never see caper off his feet - he seem to know nothing but ' trot ' and keep try a_little harder if ask to do so . 
fury has make a_few mistakes but look like a wonderful prospect , with his impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground . 
trackdown ( torrid-mighty_lady ) has work a mile in 2 : 33.3 h . 
it take this colt several weeks to strike a pace . 
then , after emasculation , he was ease_up for a_couple_of weeks . 
he has thrive on all he has go_through and look the makings of a good little race_horse . 
thor_hanover ( adios-trustful_hanover ) be a wonderful looking prospect and another good individual , with solid , rugged conformation , good , flat_bone and excellent feet . 
this colt arrive_at the raceway early last november , and immediately was put into harness and line-driven for a_few days , and_then put to cart and break_in very nicely , know nothing but trot . 
he appear in the hopples about november 14 , was treat for worms on the 18 th , the latter date be the first time he strike a real pace . 
on december 5 he pace a mile in 2 : 55 on the twice-around , out in third position all_the_way . 
this colt has do everything ask of him , and done it with ease .

this be one of the best-tempered tar heels ever at the center . 
the first time he was harness he stand like a gentle old mare ; the crupper under his tail seem to be old stuff . 
the fourth time in harness he walk off like a gentleman . 
being blister for curbs has delay his work somewhat . 
but up_to_date he has show as much_as any in the big simpson stable . 
hustler ( knight_dream-torkin ) be a playful bay rascal of a colt , not the best gaited , but he surely can pace and be right_there with them , and sometimes lead them , in the best miles . 
torrid_freight ( torrid-breeze on hal ) be a very rugged , strong-made colt with a wonderful stride who has do with ease everything ask of him . 
his best time be around 2 : 33 . 
strongheart ( adios-direct_gal ) , a fair-looking sorrel colt , know nothing but pace and has be right_there in the best miles . 
torrid_adios ( torrid-adios_molly ) be not so masculine as most_of the colts , but i like his type and he certainly be one of the best-gaited pacers on the grounds . 
blister for curbs and lay_off three weeks , he is come_along fine and look_like a pacer to me . 
first_flyer ( frisco_flyer-castle_light ) look_like a splendid candidate for the illinois_stakes . 
his best time be 2 : 33.2 h . 
the colts in simpson 's stable have little if anything on the fillies , especially the pacers . 
justine_hanover ( sampson_hanover-justitia_hanover ) is improve with each work-out and pace 2 : 32.4 h weeks ago . 
mrs._freight ( knight_dream-miss_reed ) show promise and does it in good form , and her best time be about 2 : 35 . 
hoopla ( tar_heel-holiday_hanover ) , a filly that want to trot , knock herself october 31 and november_1 fight the hopples . 
she was then train on the trot until december 29 , hitch to a breaking cart once around the half-mile track and hoppled again . 
this time she submit and in a_few days was go good . 
on january 11 she pace a mile in 2 : 43.1 - : 38 h ; on jan. 18 2 : 37.3 - : 36.1 h ; on jan. 21 , 2 : 36 . 
this filly be a much better individual than either of her full-sisters , valentine_day and cerise - more scale and much better underpinning . 
she be more like her full brother , taraday_hanover , but larger . 
up_to_date she be a grand-looking filly . 
pete_dailey have four promising 2 - year-old pacers . 
marquis pick ( gene_abbe-direct_grattan ) seem to be the pick of the stable at_the_present_time . 
he be a fine-looking colt with a good body , good set of legs and nice way of go .

majestic pick come next , with a mile in 2 : 30 - : 33.2 . 
this colt be another fine-looking equine . 
staley_hanover ( knight_dream-sweetmite_hanover ) be a_little on the small side but a very compact colt and look_like one to stand training and many future battles with colts in his class . 
best time to_date be 2 : 34 - : 34 . 
step aside ( direct rhythm-wily widow ) has work in 2 : 32 on the half-mile track and show promise .

the last-named be one of the favorites in the stable , and the boys like her very_much . 
i will be able to tell you more about this string of equines in the near future . 
i have just see debonnie and prompt_time work a mile in 2 : 34 , last_quarter in : 35.3 . 
in go_away debonnie get_behind several lengths , stall at_the_start - she be a_little fussy . 
they leave the three-quarters together and finish almost together . 
prompt_time show class . 
this filly be another adios that want to trot , and trot she did until force to do otherwise . 
after well break and equip with 12 oz shoes on behind , bare-footed in_front , she would trot a real storm with the master , delvin , drive . 
being place in the hopples she be completely baffled . 
she hesitate , she hop , she roll and rock , skip and jump , but in some two_weeks she start to pace , from_that time to this she has show steady improvement and now look_like one of the classiest things on the grounds . 
rain on friday prevent many workouts , but there be a_few miles of note on thursday .

the average reader of_this magazine own more_than one gun ( we run a survey to find_out ) but he be always on the lookout for new and better arms . 
he be more_than a reader of outdoor articles ; he be a real hunter and shooter , eager to improve his sport . 
well , if you be that kind_of sportsman we be here to help you . 
you 've probably given a_lot_of christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack , but it be not easy to decide on a new one . 
you still have time to drop a_few hints about the gifts you 'd appreciate most ; the time to decide on them be now . 
as a christmas service , i 've take_a_look a close look at this year 's crop of new models . 
here they be , with my comments and judgments . 
read on , take your pick - and start drop those hints . 
first on my own list would be two arms - a rifle and a handgun - that qualify as new in the strictest sense . 
for me , a changed barrel length or an improved stock does n't constitute a truly new design . 
such modifications be all for the best but it take something as different as a deerstalker or a jet to change arms-making concepts . 
bill_ruger 's long-awaited deerstalker ( under $ 110 ) be a new rifle action in a caliber that upset all the modern theory of high-velocity fans ; it be a short , light , quick-handling , fast-firing little timber gun design to push a heavy slug at modest velocity but with lots_of killing power and ample range for our most popular big_game - whitetail . 
ruger report that on his recent african safari the little .44 magnum cartridge be a real work horse . 
small antelope were generally grass with one_shot , and the .44 magnum carbine also bag reedbuck , kob and wart hog with deadly efficiency ; these be fairly large , tough animals . 
the deadliness of the .44 magnum in a rifle come as no surprise to me . 
at_least five years ago , tom_robinson of marlin make_up an over / under double rifle for me in_this caliber , use the now defunct model 90 action in 20 - gauge size . 
after figure_out how to regulate the barrels so_that they shoot to the same point of impact , we fire this little 20 - inch-barrel job on my home_range and in marlin 's underground test gallery . 
we quickly ran_into the same trouble that plague bill_ruger in his first experiments : three or four bullets would be place well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and_then , unaccountably , one could stray far out of the group . 
ruger learn that this be because the higher velocity achieve in a long barrel was upset the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet . 
the new , jacketed slug in .44 magnum correct this . 
but even without jacketed bullets , i have enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt that first year . 
within half an hour i jump a six-point buck that hop-skip through a rhododendron thicket , and i catch him just behind the left foreleg at 60 yards . 
he move only about 30 feet after the 240 - grain slug hit him - and this be after the bullet had pass_through a sapling . 
three more deer have fall to this same gun , and all be one-shot kills . 
my double was make with standard-weight revolver barrels ( before cut to revolver length ) , and although it compare well in_other_respects , it be considerably heavier than the deerstalker , which only scale about 6 - 1 2 pounds . 
if ever a rifle meet the needs of the whitetail hunter , this be it . 
the deerstalker point with the ease , speed and precision of a fine imported double shotgun , and its trigger pull be light and sharp . 
the 240 - grain bullet leave the muzzle at 1850 fps , which give it all the smash need at woods ranges . 
with five shots at the immediate command of the hunter 's trigger finger , the gun and load be a deadly combination . 
the second really new development this year be a revolver handle a different sort_of varmint load - the .22 remington_jet magnum center_fire . 
at_present it be available in one model , the fine and familiar smith + wesson magnum revolver ( about $ 110 ) , long a top-quality handgun among target arms . 
the velocity of_this .22 - caliber , 40 - grain bullet is rate at a very hot 2460 fps , and it be the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge , with a mid-range rise of about an inch over a 100 - yard range . 
this be a varmint load , pure_and_simple ; it be much too explosive for small edible game . 
it can cut a red_squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry of feathers . 
the_most intriguing aspect of the s + w magnum chamber for the new jet be that it can also fire standard .22 rim-fires by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers . 
you may therefore convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm , although the difference in the point of impact ( jet vs. rim-fire ) can be somewhat disconcerting . 
the accuracy of the jet cartridge be fine ; i test it in my scoped s + w and it be good enough to allow me to hit a chuck with every shot at 100 yards if i do my part by hold the handgun steadily . 
the fact that the deerstalker and the jet be the only completely new designs this year does n't mean that 1961 did n't see changes in models , actions and calibers . 
aside from the ruger carbine , a_number_of hunting rifles have been introduce for_the_first_time . 
here be the brands ( in_alphabetical_order ) and the new models . 
newcomers to the american hunter be the browning group of bolt-action , high-power rifles . 
they have fine fn actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal and the stock wood . 
barrel weights vary sensibly with the various calibers available , and these include the standard bores ( about $ 165 ) plus the magnums ( around $ 170 ) ; the latter include the .264 , .300 h + h , .338 , .375 and .458 . 
shotgun-type rubber recoil pads be standard on all_of the magnums except the .264 . 
stock designs be excellent for use with scopes . 
colt 's center-fire 1961 rifles are all make with sako actions , regardless_of caliber . 
the .222 's have the short action ; the .243 and .308 , the medium action , and the .270 , * * f and the magnums , the long action ( about $ 135 for the standard coltsman and $ 200 for the custom version ) . 
previously , fn actions were use for the larger cartridges . 
high standard has introduce a .22 auto , the sport-king , in two grades - field and special ( less_than $ 45 and just over $ 45 , respectively ) . 
it be a streamlined rifle , fast and well-made . 
among .22 magnum rim-fire rifles , 1961 's lone newcomer be the kodiak model 260 autoloader ( around $ 60 ) . 
previously known as jefferson_arms , kodiak has give this 11 - shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design , and the 260 be the first autoloader to handle .22 magnum rim-fires . 
marlin has make two contributions to the harvest of new offerings . 
the model 99 ( under $ 45 ) be a light-weight , streamlined .22 rim-fire auto with a tubular magazine that hold 18 long rifles . 
it be extremely accurate for an auto , and the test rifle i try be completely trouble-free in functioning . 
the 989 ( about $ 40 ) be an even newer .22 auto , this one with a seven - or 12 - shot clip . 
once_again the mossberg targo outfit has appear , but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun combination . 
the bore be unrifled but is provide with an insert tube which be rifled and which , surprisingly , give pretty fair accuracy even_though it be only 3 - 1 2 inches long . 
you can unscrew this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with .22 shotshells - to break the little targo clay targets . 
a trap for throw these miniature clays fasten to the barrel so_that the shooter can throw his own targets . 
a spring trap for solid mounting and a regular hand trap be also available . 
you can have your choice of a seven-shot repeater , the 340 tr ( about $ 40 ) or a single-shot , the 320 tr ( $ 10 less ) . 
the targo be a good outfit for fun shooting or for economic wing-shooting practice , but it be tougher than it look to run_up a score on the clay birds . 
they 'll travel 50 feet or more when throw from the spring trap but it be almost impossible to break one after it pass the 35 - foot mark . 
the combination of thin pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get_on the_birds , right_now ! 
big magnum calibers appear in the remington line for 1961 , with the addition of the .375 and .458 to the list of model 725 's . 
these are make on special order only , in kodiak grade ( about $ 310 ) , with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads ; they weigh around nine pounds . 
a shortened version of the highly regarded remington 742 autoloader also appear in 1961 . 
this carbine ( under $ 140 , about $ 15 more for a deluxe grade ) have an 18 - 1 2 - inch barrel and was obviously inspire by the popularity of last year 's model 760 pump with a short-barrel . 
this design be hard to beat for timber hunting or for pack in a saddle scabbard . 
presently , the 742 c be available in * * f . 
the latest versions of the famous savage model 99 be the 99 featherweight ( about $ 125 ) and the 99 deluxe ( under $ 135 ) , which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger design . 
the replacement of the slide-lock side safety_catch will make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new safety be easier and faster to operate . 
a fresh crop of beginners ' guns show_up in 1961 , and they be good bets for your christmas_gift list if you 're wonder what to get for a youngster . 
the_most unusual of them be the ithaca 49 ( about $ 20 , $ 5 for a saddle scabbard ) - a lever-action single-shot pattern after the famous winchester lever-action and feature the western look . 
because of its traditional lines , it probably have more kid appeal than any other model . 
the action be a drop-block , handle all the standard .22 rim-fires . 
marlin 's latest is also design for the beginning shooter , although it be a full-sized rifle with plenty of barrel weight and ample stock . 
this be the model 122 ( about $ 20 ) ; it be a single-shot bolt-action with an automatic safety - i. e. , the safety go_on every time the bolt is_lifted and the gun cock for the next shot . 
stock design be excellent , and this model be a good first gun . 
another boy 's model be the .22 single-shot remington 514 c ( around $ 20 ) , which come_with a 21 - inch barrel and a short - 12 - 1 2 - inch - stock ; it be just_right for a boy of 12 - 1 2 . 
a beginner 's shotgun has also been introduce this year . 
the single-barrel stevens 940 y ( under $ 35 ) is make with a side lever rather_than a top-tang lever because many youngsters be n't strong enough to operate a top tang to open a gun - and the side lever does indeed open very easily . 
this gun have a 12 - 1 2 - inch stock and be available in either 20 or .410 gauge . 
there 's another addition to the stevens line , the pump-action model 77 in .410 ( under $ 75 ) , which you may or may_not consider a kid 's gun ; many experienced hunters like this gauge and type of scattergun too . 
although there be no startling developments in shotgun design this year , a_number_of new models and variations of existing models did hit the market . 
for_example , a browning trap version of the superposed over / under , the broadway ( from $ 350 up , depending_on grade ) , differ from standard models in_that it be equipped with a full beavertail fore end , a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast sighting . 
the colt line now include a new scattergun , the standard or custom_pump model ( about $ 90 and $ 150 , respectively ) in 12 , 16 and 20 . 
firearms_international has introduce another import , this one from finland . 
it 's the valmet ( about $ 170 ) , a 12 - gauge over / under very_much_like the old remington 32 - which be so fine a gun that today a used one still bring high prices . 
high_standard has also add two models to its line . 
the supermatic trophy ( prices begin at less_than $ 135 and depend_on grade and optional features ) be a 12 - gauge auto . 
the flite-king trophy ( begin at just over $ 85 ) be a pump gun in 12 or 16 . 
either model be a very good dollar value . 
mossberg 's latest contribution to the field be the model 500 ( from $ 73.50 ) ; this be an improved version of the old model 200 , a pump-action 12 - gauge shotgun . 
see page 24 for a complete report on it . 
aside from the .22 jet - which i couple with the deerstalker carbine as one of the year 's two biggest developments - few significant innovations appear among 1961 's handguns . 
livery_stable - j._vernon , prop. coaching had decline considerably by 1905 , but the sign be still there , near the old wells_fargo building in san_francisco , creak in the fog as it had for thirty years . 
john_vernon had have all the patronage he care_for - he had prosper , but he could not retire from horsedom . 
coach be in his blood . 
he have two interests in life : the pleasures of the table and driving . 
twice a week he drive his tallyho over the santa_cruz road , upland and through the redwood forest , with orchards below him at one hand , and glimpses of the pacific at the other . 
the journey back he made along the coast road , travel hell-for-leather , every lantern of the tallyho ablaze . 
the southward route be the classic run in california , and the_most fashionable . 
his patronage on this stretch was make_up largely of san_franciscans - regulars , most_of them , and trenchermen like himself . 
they did not complain at the inhuman hour of start ( seven in the morning ) , nor of the tariff , which be reasonable since it cover everything but the tobacco . 
breakfast be at the palace_hotel , luncheon be somewhere in the mountain forest , and dinner be either at boulder_creek or at santa_cruz . 
gaze too long at the scenery could be tiring , so halts were contrive between meals . 
then the chinese hostler , who ride with vernon on the box , would break_open a hamper and produce filets of smoked bass or sturgeon , sandwiches , pickled eggs , and a rum sangaree to be heat over a spirit_lamp . 
in spring and in autumn the run was make for a group of botanists which include an old friend of mine . 
they gather roots , bulbs , odd ferns , leaves , and bits of resin from the rare santa_lucia_fir , which exist only on a forty-five mile strip on the westerly side of these mountains . 
in the spanish days franciscan monks roam here to collect the resin for incense . 
it yield a fragrance as orphic as that of the pastilles of malabar . 
vernon be serviceable on the botanical field trips , but he could arrange no schedule with the cooks , and he be glad when the trips drop_off , and the botanists begin to motor out by themselves . 
my friend often breakfast with vernon on the morning of the regular tallyho run . 
this be an honor , like dine with a captain at his private table . 
vernon 's office adjoin the stable , and the walls were adorn with brightly colored lithographs , the folk_art of the period . 
they advertise harness polish , liniments , ball 's rubber_boots , green_river whiskey , hood 's sarsaparilla , patent_medicines , shoe blacking , and chewing tobacco . 
the hostler would have the table ready and a pot of coffee hiss on the stove ; then a porter from manning 's fish_house would trot in with a tray on his head . 
it was drape with snowy napkins that keep hot a platter of oyster salt roast and a mound of corn_fritters . 
vernon be consummately fond of oysters , and manning 's had be famous for them since the civil_war . 
oyster salt roast - oysters on the half shell , cook on a bed of coarse salt that keep them hot when serve - be a standby at manning 's . 
its early morning patrons be coachmen , who fortify themselves for the day with_that delicacy . 
in the 1890 's the palace_hotel begin serve an oyster dish name after its manager , john_c._kirkpatrick . 
this dish much resemble the oysters_rockefeller make famous by antoine 's in new_orleans , though the palace chef announce it as a variant of manning 's roast oysters . 
( gastronomes have long argue about which come first , the palace 's or antoine 's . 
antoine 's hold as mandatory a splash of absinthe or pernod on the parsley or spinach which was use for the underbedding . 
the kirkpatrick version hold liqueur as optional . ) 
vernon , however , hold_out for plain oyster roast , and plenty of_it , unadorned by herbs or any seasoning but salt , though he did fancy a_bit of lemon . 
after the meal , he and his guests go_out to inspect the rig ; this be merely a ritual , to please all hands concerned . 
the tallyho had cost vernon $ 2300 . 
a replica of two coaches make in england for the belmont_club in the east , and matchless west of the rockies , it be the despair of whips on the santa_cruz run . 
one could shave in the reflection of its french-polished panels , and its axles be grease like those of roulette_wheels . 
the horses were groom to a high gloss ; depart , they step solemnly with knees lift to the jaw , for they had been train to drag at important funerals . 
but for the start of the santa_cruz run , the whip fall . 
the clients board the tallyho at the palace promptly at seven . 
they had been feed a hunting breakfast , so called because a kedgeree , the dish identify with fox_hunting , be on the bill . 
there be many ways of make a kedgeree , every one of_which be right . 
here be an original kedgeree recipe from the family_club 's kitchen . 
flake ( for three ) a cupful of cold boiled haddock , mix with a cupful of cooked rice , two minced hard-boiled_eggs , some buttery white_sauce done_with cream , cayenne , pepper , salt , a pinch of curry , a tablespoonful of minced onion fried , and a_bit of anchovy . 
heat and serve hot on toast . 
the omelet name for ernest_arbogast , the palace 's chef , be even more in_demand . 
for decades it be the_most popular dish serve in the ladies ' grill at breakfast , and it be one of the few old palace dishes that still survive . 
native_california oysters , salty and piquant , as coppery as delawares and not_much larger than a five-cent piece , went into it . 
the original formula go thus . 
fry in butter a small minced onion , rub with a tablespoonful of flour , add half a cup of cream , six beaten eggs , pepper , celery_salt , a teaspoonful of minced chives , a dash of cayenne , and a pinch of nutmeg . 
a jigger of dry sherry follow , and as the mixture stiffen , in go a_hundred of the little oysters . 
louis_sherry once stay_at a fortnight at the palace , and he be so pleased with omelet arbogast that he introduce it at his restaurant in new_york . 
j._pierpont_morgan had come_in his private train to san_francisco , to attend an episcopal convention , and bring the restaurateur with him . 
as things happen , morgan was_installed in the nob_hill residence of a magnate friend , whose kitchen swarm with cooks of approved talent . 
sherry remain in his hotel suite , where he amuse himself as best he could . 
twice he leave everything to his entourage , and flee to make the santa_cruz tour under vernon 's guidance . 
in the grand court of the palace , notable for its tiers of moorish galleries that look down on the maelstrom of vehicles below , vernon 's station be at the entrance . 
it be a post of honor , hold inviolate for him ; he have the primacy among the coachmen . 
of majestic build , rubicund and slash-mouthed , he resemble the late general_winfield_scott , who was say to be the_most imposing general of his century , if_not of all centuries . 
vernon wear a gray tall hat , a gardenia , and maroon wellington_boots that glisten like currant jelly . 
promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court with twelve in the tallyho . 
he have style : he hold his reins in a loose bunch at the third button of his checked epsom surtout , and when the horses lean at a curve , as if bend by the force of a gale , he lean with them . 
they canter down the peninsula , not slacken until the coach reach woodside where the santa_cruz uplands begin . 
the road maps of the region have change since 1905 ; inns have burn_down , move elsewhere , or take other names . 
once on_the_road ( and especially if the passengers be all regulars and masculine ) , the schedule mean nothing . 
an agreeable ease suffuse vernon and the passengers of the tallyho , from which there issue clouds of smoke . 
vernon would tilt his hat over one ear as he lounge with his feet on the dashboard , indulge in a huge cigar . 
the horses move at a clump ; they be no_more on parade than be their driver ; one fork of the road be as_good_as another . 
the santa_cruz mountains sprawl over three counties , and the roads twist through sky-tapping redwoods down whose furrowed columns ripple streams of rain , even when heat bake the santa_clara valley below at the left . 
the water splash into shoulder-high tracts of fernery . 
you arrive there in seersucker , and feel you be half-witted not to bring a mackintosh . 
vernon keep an account_book with a list of all the establishments that he think worthy of patronage . 
a_number_of them must have fall_into disfavor ; they were strike_out with remarks in red ink , denounce both the cooks and the management . 
he be copious in his praise of those that serve food that be good to eat . 
the horses seem to know these by instinct , he used_to say : such places invariably have stables with superior feed bins . 
there be wright 's , for one , lose amongst trees , its wide verandas strew with rockers . 
many_of its sojourners be devoted_to seclusion and quiet , and live there to the end of their days . 
it be the haunt of writer ambrose_bierce , who admire its redwoods . 
acorns from the great oaks feed the small black pigs ( akin to berkshires ) , whose `` carcass sweepstakes '' be renowned . 
their ham butts , cure in oak-log smoke , were also esteem when roast or boil , and serve with this original sauce . 
put into a saucepan a cupful of the baked ham gravy , or of the boiled ham liquor , with a half stick of butter , three teaspoonfuls of made mustard , and two mashed garlic_cloves . 
contribute also an onion , a peeled tomato and two pickled gherkins , and a mashed lime . 
after this has simmer an hour , add two tablespoons each of worcestershire , catsup , and chutney , two pickled walnuts , and a pint of sherry . 
then simmer fifteen minutes longer . 
every winter a kegful of_this sauce was make and place at the end of a row of four other kegs in the cellar , so_that when its turn come , it be properly mellowed . 
vineyards and orchards also grow around wright 's , and deer be rather a nuisance ; they leap six-foot fences with the agility of panthers . 
but no one complain when they wind_up , regardless_of season , in venison pies . 
no one complain of the white_wine either : at this altitude of two thousand feet , grapes acquire a dryness and the tang of gunflint . 
( the almaden vineyards have now climb to this height . ) 
apple trees grow there also . 
though creeks in the santa_cruz mountains flow brimful the year round and it is forever spring , the apples that grow there have a wintry crackle . 
dwellers thereabouts prefer to get their apple_pies at the local bakery , which have a brick oven fire with redwood billets . 
the merit of the pie , vernon believe , be_due more to its making than to the waning heat of the oven . 
the recipe , which he get from the baker , and write_down in his ledger , be basically this . 
peel , core , and slice across enough apples to make a dome in the pie tin , and set_aside . 
in a saucepan put sufficient water to cover them , an equal amount of sugar , a sliced lemon , a tablespoonful of apricot preserve or jam , a pinch each of clove and nutmeg , and a large bay_leaf . 
let this boil gently for twenty minutes , then strain . 
poach the apples in_this syrup for twelve minutes , drain them , and cool . 
set the apples in the pastry-lined tin , spread over them three tablespoonfuls of softened butter , with as much brown_sugar , a sprinkling of nutmeg , and a fresh bay_leaf , then lay on a cover of pastry , and gild it with beaten yolk of egg . 
those who have never travel the width and length of_this land cannot conceive , on the basis of textbook description alone , the overwhelming space and variety of_this country hold together under one government . 
the miracle of democratic america come_home to one most strongly only when one has see the endless great_plains of the midwest ; the sky-reaching peaks of the northwest mountains ; the smoke-filled , art-filled , drama-filled life of the great cities of the east ; the lush and historic charm of the south .

rich_in christian and moslem art , istanbul be today a fascinating museum of east and west that recently become a seaside resort as_well with the development of new beaches on the bosphorus and the sea of marmara only a short distance from the center of town . 
easy to get to , and become more popular every_year , it be only fourteen hours from new_york by pan_american_world airways jet , four hours from rome . 
most_of the sights lie_in the old section across the golden_horn from the modern hotels . 
i start my tour of them at the turkish government_tourist_office , next to pan_american 's office on_the_left as you enter the driveway that lead to the hilton_hotel . 
from there i turn left along cumhuriyet_cadesi past more hotels and a park on_the_left , republic gardens , and come_in a_few moments to taksim_square , one of the hubs of the city , with the monument of the republic , erect in 1928 , in its center . 
directly across from the gardens i find a bus_stop sign for t 4 and ride it down to the bosphorus , with the sports center on my left just before i reach the water and the entrance to dolmabahce_palace immediately after_that . 
there the bus turn right_along the bosphorus , past ocean_liners at anchor , to galata bridge over the entrance to the golden_horn , a brown sweep of water that empty into the bosphorus . 
across the bridge on_the_left i see st._sophia with its sturdy brown minarets and to the right of them the slenderer spires of the_blue mosque . 
on the other side of the golden_horn i ride through eminonu_square , with yeni_cami , or the new_mosque , which date_from the seventeenth century , just across from the entrance to the bridge . 
pass it , the bus climb a hill , with the covered spice bazaar on_the_right and pandelli 's , a famous and excellent restaurant , above it . 
at the top of the hill the buildings on_the_left give_way to a park . 
i get_off there , cross the street , walk ahead with st._sophia on my left , the_blue mosque on my right , and in_a_moment come to the entrance of st._sophia . 
erect on the site of pagan temples and three previous st._sophias , the first of_which was begin by constantine , this fourth church was start by justinian in 532 and complete twenty years later . 
on his first trip to the finished structure he boast that he had build a temple grander than solomon 's in jerusalem . 
a_few years later the dome fall_in . 
nevertheless , it remain one of the_most splendid churches of the eastern_empire , where the byzantine emperors were crown . 
after the turks conquer the city in 1453 they convert it to a mosque , add the stubby minarets . 
in the second_half of the sixteenth_century , sinan , the great architect who be the michelangelo of the east , design the massive buttresses that now help support the dome . 
with the birth of the turkish republic after the first_world_war , st._sophia become a museum , and the ancient mosaics , which were plaster_over by the moslems , whose religion forbid pictures in holy_places , have been_restored . 
inside over the first door i see one of these , which show constantine offer the city to the_virgin mary and justinian offer the temple . 
on the columns around the immense dome be round plaques with arabic writing . 
the eight green columns , i learn , come from the temple of artemis at ephesus , the others , red , from the temple of the sun at heliopolis . 
beneath the dome i see the spot where the byzantine emperors were crown , a_bit of floor protect now by a wooden fence . 
behind this be a minber or moslem pulpit and near it a raised platform with golden grillwork , where the emperors and , after them , the sultans , sit . 
directly opposite be the emperor 's door , through which they enter the building . 
outside st._sophia i walk through the flower_garden in_front of_it , with the_blue mosque ahead on my left . 
across the street on my right i see the hippodrome , now a park . 
it was lay_out in 196 for chariot_races and other public games . 
statues and other monuments that stand there were steal , mostly by the waves of crusaders . 
at the beginning of the hippodrome i see the kaiser 's fountain , an ugly octagonal building with a glass dome , build in 1895 by the german emperor , and on my left , directly across from_it , the tomb of sultan_ahmet , who construct the_blue mosque , more properly known by his name . 
just before come to the mosque entrance i cross the street , enter the hippodrome , and walk ahead to the obelisk of theodosius , originally erect in heliopolis in egypt about 1600 b._c. by thutmose , who also build those now in new_york , london and rome at the lateran . 
this one was set_up here in 390 a._d. on a pedestal , the faces of_which are carve with statues of the emperor and his family watch games in the hippodrome , do so realistically that the obelisk itself is_included_in them . 
beyond it i note a small green column , about twelve feet below the present ground_level - the serpentine column , three entwined serpents , which once stand at the temple of apollo at delphi , greece . 
near the end of the hippodrome i come_upon the built column , a truncated obelisk of blocks , all that remain of a monument that once rival the colossus of rhodes . 
retrace my steps to the mosque of sultan_ahmet , only one with six minarets , i enter the courtyard , with a gallery support by pointed_arches run around it and a fountain in_the_middle . 
one of the_most beautiful buildings in istanbul , it was_constructed in the early years of the seventeenth century , with a huge central dome , two half domes that seem to cascade_down from_it , and smaller full domes around the gallery . 
the round minarets , tall and graceful , rise from rectangular bases and have three platforms from which the muezzin can chant his call to prayer . 
inside , the walls are cover with blue and white tile , the floor with red and cream carpets . 
back at the kaiser 's fountain , i walk left to the streetcar stop and ride up the hill - any car will do - past the column of constantine , also_known_as the burnt column , at the top on my right . 
it stand in the middle of_what be once the forum of constantine , who bring it from rome . 
i stay on the car for a_few minutes until , turn right , it enter a huge square , bayezit , with the bayezit_mosque on_the_right and the gate to the university just beyond it . 
there i get_off , cross the square , and on_the_side directly opposite the gate find a good restaurant , hard to come_by in_this part of the city . 
called the marmara_gazinosu , it be on the third floor , with signs point_the_way there , and have a terrace overlook the sea of marmara . 
after lunch , in the arcade on my left just before reach the street i find a pastry shop that sell some of the best baklava - a sweet , flaky cake - in istanbul . 
it be a great favorite of the university_students , and i join them there for dessert . 
take the streetcar back to kaiser 's fountain , i walk ahead , then left down the street opposite st._sophia and just beyond the corner come to a small , one-story building with a red-tile roof , which be the entrance to the sunken_palace . 
actually an underground cistern , its roof support by rows and rows of pillars , it was_built by justinian in the sixth_century to supply the palace with water . 
there be still water in it . 
i find it fairly depressing and emerge almost immediately . 
outside i walk past the entrance to st._sophia , turn left at the end of_it , and continue toward a gate in the wall ahead . 
just before reach it i come to a grey and brown stone building that look somewhat like an oriental pagoda , with arabic lettering in gold and colored tile decorations - the fountain of sultan_ahmet . 
go through the imperial_gate in the wall , i enter the grounds of topkapi_palace , home of the sultans and nerve_center of the vast ottoman_empire , and walk along a road toward another gate in the distance , past the church of st._irene , complete by constantine in 330 a._d. on my left , and_then , just outside the second gate , i see a spring with a tap in the wall on my right - the executioner 's spring , where he wash his hands and his sword after behead his victims . 
pass_through the gate , with towers on either side once use as prisons , i enter a huge square surround by buildings , and on the wall to my right find a general plan of the grounds , with explanations in english for each building . 
there be a good many_of them . 
at_one_time about 10000 people live there . 
follow arrowed signs , i veer right toward the former kitchens , complete with chimneys , which now house one of the world 's greatest collections of chinese porcelain and a fabulous array of silver dinner_services . 
next to_it be a copper section , with cooking_utensils and a figure of the chief cook in an elaborate , floor-length robe . 
in the court once_more , i go right toward the reception house , a long one-story building with a deep portico . 
go through a door into another small court , i had the throne room directly in_front . 
i walk to the right around it to buildings contain illuminated manuscripts and come to the treasury , which house such things as coffee_cups cover with diamonds , jewelled swords , rifles glitter with diamonds and huge divan-like thrones as large as small beds , on_which the sultans sit cross-legged . 
they are make of gold and cover with emeralds , pearls and other jewels . 
take the path behind the throne room to the building directly beyond it , the portrait gallery , i go right at the end of_it , through a garden to a small building at the back - a sitting_room furnished with low blue divans , its floor covered with carpets , its ceiling painted with gold squares and floral designs . 
do start fires one or two hours ahead_of_time to obtain a lasting bed of glowing coals . 
keep ashes from one barbecue to the next to sprinkle over coals if they be too hot , and to stop flames that arise from melt grease . 
do line barbecue fire bowl with heavy foil to reflect heat . 
do n't forget to buy a plastic pastry brush for baste with sauces . 
clean it meticulously in boiling water and detergent , rinse thoroughly . 
do build a wall of glowing coals six to eight inches in_front of meat that_is barbecue on an electric spit . 
make use of the back of the barbecue or of the hood for heat vegetables , sauces and such . 
do n't fail to shorten cooking time by the use of aluminum_foil cut slightly larger than the surface of steaks and chops . 
sear on both sides then cover meat loosely with heat reflecting foil for juiciest results . 
do avoid puncture or cut into meats to test them . 
if doubtful about a steak , boldly cut it in half . 
if necessary to replace both halves on grill , sear cuts and allot extra_time . 
for roasts , insert meat_thermometer diagonally so it does not rest_on bone . 
also make sure thermometer does not touch the revolving spit or hit the coals . 
do n't practice a new recipe on guests . 
have a test-run on the family first , to be sure timing and seasoning be right . 
do buy meat the day or the day before you intend to cook it . 
keep it no_longer than 36 hours before cook , and keep it in the coldest ( but non-freezing ) compartment of the refrigerator . 
do n't plan meals that be too complicated . 
limit yourself to good meat and drink , with bread , salad , corn or potatoes as accessories . 
keep the desserts simple ; fruit do nicely . 
do whatever kitchen work , such_as fix a salad , prepare garlic_bread , or make a marinade sauce , ahead_of_time . 
when you start the outdoor performance , you can stay outdoors without a dozen running trips into the kitchen . 
( this go_for get a drink tray ready , and for have a big cooler full_of ice on_hand long before the party begin . ) 
do n't think you have_to start with the_most expensive equipment in the world . 
the simplest grill ( pan type ) or inexpensive hibachi can make you a chef . 
you need tongs to handle meat ; long forks for turn potatoes and corn ; heavy foil on_hand at_all_times . 
and lots_of hot_pads ! 
do keep the grill high enough above the fire so_that when fat from meat drip down and flare_up , flames cannot reach the meat . 
do n't forget to have a supply of melamine plates , bowls , cups , saucers , and platters for outdoor use . 
make of the world 's toughest unbreakable plastic , melamine dinnerware come in almost 400 different patterns and dozens of colors . 
there be even one set that have `` barbecue '' written on it . 
do without fancy tablecloths . 
it 's cheaper to buy wall-tex and cover your outdoor table . 
or buy half_a_dozen lengths of oilcloth and change patterns for different kinds of barbecues . 
oilcloth only cost about 79 c a yard for the very best . 
tougher than plastic , it wear well . 
do n't forget - when you take to the hills or the beach - that your cooler , which you might have use for wine - or beer-cooling on your terrace or back yard , be indispensable for carry liquid refreshments . 
there be many varieties of coolers and they serve many purposes . 
with them , you can carry steaks and hamburgers at refrigerator temperatures , and also get your frozen_food for stews and chowders , to the marina or picnic , in a-1 condition . 
do use paper napkins ; lots_of them . 
except when you prepare `` do_it_yourself '' shish kebob or a lobster roast . 
then you 'll want terry cloth towels for mop_up . 
do n't think barbecue cooking be just sometimes , or seasonal . 
it 's year-round , and everywhere . 
in the winter , hibachi in the kitchen or grill over the logs of the fireplace . 
even use your portable electric or gas grill in the winter , inside . 
summertime supper , outside , be a natural . 
you 'll find , once your technique is perfect , that you can cook on a boat with a simple bernz-o-matic . 
do buy all-purpose mugs or cups . 
get copper or earthenware mugs that keep beer chilled or soup hot . 
be sure to get a_few_more than you need . 
you will discover you keep the sauce for baste meat in one , use six for drinks , serve soup or coffee in another half-dozen - and need one more to mix the salad_dressing . 
do n't forget the joys of a meal on_the_road . 
if you travel over the vast u._s._a. you will , no_doubt , discover that feeding be an expensive business . 
decide in_the_beginning to put_to_work your barbecue equipment to work . 
you can take it with you - a picnic bag , a grill , a cooler for soft_drinks and beer , and for frozen convenience_foods . 
eat in a restaurant or motel mornings and evenings ; or just evenings . 
turn_off at any one of the marked picnic_areas ( gasoline companies have touring service_bureaus that issue booklets on national_parks to tell you where you have barbecue facilities ) and - with soft_drinks cool from morning loading_up , hamburger , buns , an array of relishes , and fresh fruit - your lunch be 75  cheaper than at a restaurant , and 100  more fun . 
you need a_little stove , a coffee_pot and a stew pot ; maybe a skillet , a basket of essentials like salt , pepper , plates , forks , knives and a can_opener . 
as you pull_out of your motel or national_park home-for-the-night , visit a market and buy just what you need for the next meal . 
for 25 c load_up the cooler with ice and keep cool pop_in the car . 
spice be a fact of life in the u._s._a. . 
you only have_to think_of franks and sausages to know what i mean . 
go a step further and list all the wonderful barbecue basics - cervelat , salami , vienna_sausages , mettwurst , bratwurst , bockwurst , knackwurst , bologna , pepperoni , blutwurst - and you have a long list of easy specialties . 
threaded on a skewer with new boiled potatoes , a_bit of green_pepper , a fresh white mushroom - any one of these spiced meats make a man a cook , and a meal a feast . 
sure , for the_most of us , a frankfurter be the favorite . 
a story go that a certain herr_feuchtwanger of st._louis , around 1883 serve his sausages ( grilled ) and mustard to his fancy customers . 
so_that his customers should not soil their hands , feuchtwanger issue white gloves . 
discovery that the gloves frequently leave with the customers make the wise peddler of spiced sausage-meat come_upon a compromise . 
he have a bakery make buns sized to fit his franks . 
years later , franks-in-buns were accept as the `` first to go '' at the new_york polo grounds . 
the nations 's number_one picnic treat be the skinless frankfurter - toast over a bonfire on the beach or , more sedately , charcoal broil on a portable grill . 
either way it 's hard to beat in flavor as_well as ease of preparation . 
to make the picnic frank come_close to perfection , remember these tips : 
- score each frankfurter in four or five places about a third of the way through . 
this permit the juices to permeate the meat during cook . 
- relishes be as vital to the success of the frank as be buns . 
bring along the conventional ones - catsup , pickle relish , mustard , mayonnaise - plus a_few extras , such_as tangy barbecue_sauce , chive cream_cheese , or horse-radish for the brave ones in the crowd . 
- use a portable grill permit you to toast the buns , too . 
watch closely while brown them , as it does n't take long . 
- an unusual flavor can be achieve by marinate the franks in french_dressing or a mixture of honey , lemon_juice and brown_sugar prior to the picnic . 
broil or toast as_usual .

clean wooden molds and presses thoroughly ; they must be free_of oil , wax and dust . 
the size of wooden mold will determine the amount of clay need . 
roll clay to thickness indicate in individual instructions . 
whenever possible , use the wooden mold as a pattern for cut clay . 
when mold have more_than one design cavity , make individual paper patterns . 
place mold or paper pattern on rolled clay and cut clay by hold knife in vertical position ( cut more pieces than require for project to make allowance for defects ; experiment with defects for decoration techniques of glazes and colors ) . 
place the cut clay piece loosely over the carved cavity design side of wooden mold . 
to obtain clear impression of mold , press clay gently but firmly into mold cavity , start at center and work to outer edges . 
trim excess clay away from outer edges . 
check thickness of clay and build_up thin areas by moisten surface with a_little water and add small pieces of clay . 
be sure to press the additional clay firmly into place without lock_in air_bubbles . 
allow project to stand for about five minutes ( if wooden press mold be a good antique , do not leave clay in too long as the dampness may cause mold to crack ) . 
to release clay from mold , place hands in a cupped position around project ; gently lift the edge on far side , then continue to release edge completely around mold . 
slight tapping on the underside of mold will help release the clay , but too_much agitation will cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with removal of clay from mold . 
place a_piece of plaster wall board or plaster bat on clay and reverse bat , clay and mold in one action . 
this will prevent the clay from twist or bend , cause warping when fire . 
place project on table and carefully lift the mold off . 
study surface of clay for defects or desired corrections . 
if clay be slightly out of shape , square straight sides with guide sticks or rulers press against opposite sides , or smooth round pieces with damp fingers . 
if the background of design be too smooth , or you wish to create a wood-grained effect , it may be_added at this time with a dull tool such_as the handle of a fine paintbrush . 
make slight , smooth grooves rather_than cuts for the texture ( cuts could cause air_pockets under the glaze create pinholes or craters in the glaze during firing ) . 
leave the clay on plaster board to dry slowly , cover lightly with a loose piece of plastic or cloth to prevent warping .

hotei be 23 feet long with an 8 - 1 2 - foot beam and every_inch a family boat . 
menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the helmsman have a clear view . 
youngsters can sleep or amuse themselves safely in the large cabin which have 5 - foot 11 - inch headroom , bunks for three , galley and marine toilet . 
the gals can sun themselves in the roomy aft cockpit . 
all be well distributed , not crowded_together near the stern . 
and with passenger weight shift forward , hotei level_off for speed under power of a merc 800 . 
the 80 - hp motor drive her at 25 mph with six aboard ! 
with only two aboard , hotei do better than 27 mph - and she give a comfortable ride at this speed even in a three-foot chop . 
she also bank into a turn like a fine runabout - not dig in on_the_outside to throw passengers all_over the boat like many_a small cabin_cruiser . 
nor be she a wet boat . 
we 've be out in five-foot waves and stay dry . 
a_lot_of thought go into storage_space construction . 
there 's a large compartment in the forward cockpit for charts and other items . 
the cabin have several shelves for small items and storage under the bunks for water skiis , life_jackets , etc. . 
the aft cockpit have a * * f storage bin over six feet long that double as a seat . 
on each side of the motor well there 's storage for battery , bumpers , line and spare props with six-gallon gas_tanks below . 
the well itself is design to take two merc 800 's or 500 's if you wish and there 's room for a 25 - gallon long-cruise gas_tank below it . 
needless to say , you can n't build hotei in a_couple_of weeks . 
our building time be slightly over 400 hours - but the total cost for the hull with fiberglas bottom , sink , head and hardware be under $ 800 . 
a comparable manufactured boat would cost close_to $ 3000 . 
consider what you have_to earn to be able to spend the $ 3000 and your building time be well worth it . 
a gator trailer , model 565 , is use to transport the boat to the waterways . 
this piece of equipment cost a_little over $ 600 but it will save you that in mooring and hauling fees in a_few years . 
all framing in hotei be one-inch mahogany which , in the dressed state you buy it , be about the 13 16 - inch thickness specify in the drawings . 
therefore , the lumber is buy in planks and rip to size for battens , etc. , on a table saw . 
besides flathead bronze screws , silicon bronze stronghold nails ( make by independent_nail + packing_co. , bridgewater , mass . ) are use extensively in assembly and weldwood resorcinal glue is use in_all the joints . 
construction follow a thorough study of the drawings . 
start by lay_out the six frames and the transom on a_level floor . 
draw each outline in a different-color chalk , one on top of the other . 
in_this_way you will be able to detect any obvious mistakes . 
the transom frame is make first with the joints lap , glue and fasten with one-inch , no. 12 stronghold nails . 
after notch it for the keelson , chines and battens , the half-inch plywood transom is secure to_it with glue and the same type nails . 
all frames are butt at the joints and 3 8 - inch plywood gussets are glue and nail on each side of each joint , again use the one-inch , no. 12 nails . 
the frames are notch only for the keelson and the chines . 
if notch for the battens , they would require more work , be weaken and limber holes would have_to be bore so_that bilge water could flow through . 
nowhere in the boat do the frames come in contact with the plywood planking . 
the jig is_erected after the frames and transom be complete . 
this be an important step because any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull as you advance in construction . 
be sure all members be parallel , vertical and level as_required . 
after the frames and transom are set_up on the jig and temporarily brace , a_piece of three-inch-wide mahogany ( only widths will be give since the 13 16 - inch thickness is use throughout ) is butt between frames one and two below the line of the keelson . 
the frames are glue and screw to this piece . 
the joints are also reinforce on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated fiberglas cloth and nail . 
it be over this piece that the laminated stem and keelson are splice . 
the keelson , make of two three-inch widths , is_next instal . 
the first piece is glue and screw to the frames and transom and the piece butt between frames one and two . 
the second piece is in_turn glue and screw to the first . 
note , however , that it be six inches shorter at the forward end . 
one-inch , no .10 screws are use in both cases . 
a stem jig is_next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fasten to frame one . 
the stem is laminate from four pieces . 
take two three-inch-wide pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make the four . 
then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and bend them into place on the jig . 
the first two pieces butt_against the inner member of the keelson and are glue and screw to the brace between the first two frames . 
the second two pieces lap over the inner member of the keelson and butt_against the outer member . 
they 're glue and screw to the inner member of the keelson . 
a_number_of c clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue set . 
all bottom battens be two inches wide . 
the side ones be a half-inch narrower . 
the battens are carefully fasten in_place after some necessary fair on all frames . 
glue and 1 - 1 2 - inch , no. 10 screws are use . 
placement be important because the rear seat , bunks and front jump_seats rest_on or are fasten to many_of the side battens . 
with the exception of two battens , all run to the stem where they are glue and screw after careful bevel . 
the chines go_in the same way except that they are make of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength and easier bend . 
fairing be always a tedious job but the work can be cut_down considerably with a skill planer and a simple jig . 
i clamp a 30 - inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer with a pair of sure grips . 
the aluminum , flush against the battens , act_as a fairing stick and enable me to plane the chines and keelson to the proper bevels easily . 
if you do n't own a planer and do n't want to buy one , it 's well worth rent . 
the planking be five-ply , 3 8 - inch-thick weldwood_royal_marine plywood . 
this can be obtain in 42 - inch widths 24 feet long . 
the 42 - inch width leave very little waste . 
four pieces are use . 
plank the sides first , use glue and one-inch , no. 12 stronghold nails at_all battens , the stem and the transom . 
another person inside with a weight against each batten will help in the fastening . 
the best procedure be to have a_few friends hold the planking in_place while you mark it off . 
then trim the excess . 
i use a homemaster routo-jig make by porter_cable for this job . 
it 's good for cut all the planking because it cut with a bit-like blade at high rpm and does not chatter the plywood like a saber saw . 
when cut , the planking is clamp in_place for a final and careful trimming . 
then it is mark on_the_inside where it come in contact with the transom , frames , keelson and all the battens . 
it may then be pre drill for the fastenings . 
the next step be to remove it and spread glue where it has been mark at the contact points . 
then it is replace and fasten . 
the bottom planking is apply in the same manner . 
after plank , the bottom get a layer of fiberglas . 
the spray rails are first glue on_the_outside and fasten from the inside with screws . 
then the chines are round_off and the bottom is rough sand in preparation . 
since the sides are also cover up to the spray rails , they are also rough sand in_that area . 
the cloth is lay on one half of the bottom at_a_time . 
a 50 - inch width is use on each side and it lap the keel line by about three inches . 
lie the cloth in_place and trim it to size . 
then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin . 
when the resin has harden , mix up another batch with a pigment add if you wish . 
i use bright red , mix_in the pigment in thoroughly before add the hardener . 
use a cheap brush , coat one side of the bottom with the resin and_then apply the cloth . 
when the cloth be smooth , apply another coat of resin , spread it with a paint_roller . 
be sure it be well saturated and_then allow it to harden . 
when the whole bottom has harden , use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth at the keel line and near the spray rail . 
then lay a three-inch-wide strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to_the_point of the stem . 
before the resin has harden , screw a one-inch mahogany keel strip along the centerline . 
this protect the bottom in beaching . 
fiberglas materials be available from glass_plastic_supply_co. , 1605 w._elizabeth_ave. , linden , n._j. . 
they will also supply literature on application . 
the hull is now turn_over ( with the help of about seven friends ) and place in a_level , well-braced position . 
i set it on the gator trailer . 
i lay three layers of glass cloth on_the_inside of the stem , also instal a bow eye at this time . 
for added strength , i also fasten a small block on each side of every frame and batten joint . 
again , these blocks were set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nail . 
after trim off the excess on the frames and transom which was use to fasten them to the jig at a working height , the top of the side planking is_installed . 
this is make_up of scraps left_over from the sides and bottom . 
these flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry . 
when they 're on , the top edges are plane even with the sheer batten . 
the sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from frame six to the transom , form a real strong transom brace . 
note another piece of wood six inches wide is fasten to the transom between these pieces . 
the decking be quarter-inch mahogany marine plywood . 
all the flooring and the storage bin be half-inch exterior fir plywood . 
most floor battens are glue and screw to the flooring . 
the exception be where the flooring butt . 
these battens are glue and screw to the frames . 
with all deck battens in_place , the bilge is clean and paint up_to the floor line . 
use one coat of firzite and one coat of marine paint . 
bottoms of the floorboards are also paint and the flooring is then screw in_place . 
after the decking be on , the cabin sides are_installed . 
they 're follow by the front and rear bulkheads as illustrate . 
the windshield glass be shatterproof and plexiglas is use in the cabin . 
inside , bunks are frame_up and instal as indicate . 
a head be a handy thing to have and i instal one under a removable section of the port bunk . 
the sink in the hinged panel above the bunk drain into the head and a five-gallon water_tank is mount on the bulkhead above the sink . 
for padding the seats and bunks , i use ensolite , type m . 
lightweight , non-absorbent , fire resistant and dimensionally stable , it is easily bond to the wood with contact cement . 
available in * * f sheets , it cost about a dollar a square_foot . 
you can build this vacation cottage yourself . 
it be a full scale , small , but efficient house that can become a year ' round retreat complete in every detail . 
because of the unique design by the architect egils_hermanovski , you can build most_of it in your own home workshop in your spare_time . 
most_of it be panelized and utilize standard materials , and require the use of only simple tools . 
on the following pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to your vacation cottage , from choose the proper site to apply the final trim . 
in recognition of the growing trend for second homes , or vacation cottages , we have design this one specifically with the family handyman in mind . 
it be a big project , not to be take lightly . 
but each step has been break_down into easy stages , utilize standard materials and simple tools , well within the capabilities of the handyman . 
the idea behind our design be modular units , or panelization . 
everything possible has been scale to standard sizes and measurements of materials . 
wall panels and structural timbers be standard as be windows and doors , make_for a minimum of cutting . 
we have develop an ingenious method of interlock these so_that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop , panel by panel , according to plan . 
thus , when you have prepare your foundation and lay the floor , these can be truck to the site and erect with a small crew of friends in a weekend . 
the roof timbers be precut and the panels standard so_that the house can be completely enclose in a matter of three or four days . 
then you can do the finishing touches at your leisure . 
due_to the fact that building_codes and regulations vary so_much throughout the country , the first thing to do be to find_out what , if any , they be . 
close_to a large city they might even specify the size of the nails use ; in a remote section there might be no restrictions at_all . 
this can usually be find_out at the nearest town_hall . 
at_the_same_time check the electrical , plumbing , and sanitary requirements , as_well as possible zoning regulations . 
whether electricity and public water and sewers be available or not , check the local customs in the use of bottled or l-p gas ( we give you alternatives later_on ) . 
be sure that this information be reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion . 
if there be any major restrictions , they usually can be obtain in printed form . 
where a building_permit is require , find_out what you must present when apply for one . 
in many cases , you must file a complete set of plans with the local building inspector . 
these will be available at cost from our plans department . 
some general things to look_for in a site , if you have n't already buy one , be accessibility , water drainage , and orientation . 
how be the roads , and_how will they stand_up ? 
is_there evidence of wash-outs on the property ; swampy areas or intermittent springs ? 
a visit in the early spring after a thaw will be very informative . 
note where the sun rise and set , and ask which direction the prevailing_winds and storms come from . 
will the view be something you can live with ? 
do n't worry too_much about rocky or sloping terrain ; we will take_up alternative foundations later_on . 
with this first issue we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic ( a version ) and the expandable ( b version ) . 
this will be for the shell of the house only ( roof , walls , and floor ) , and does not include the carport or balcony . 
this will permit you to get a rough estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost . 
bear_in_mind that this does not include interior panels for partitions , fancy flooring , appliances and fixtures , electrical wiring , and plumbing , all_of which will be take_up in_detail in later issues . 
the wall panels are_constructed of a framework of standard * * f and * * f of a good grade , free from structural faults . 
they should be as straight as possible , as this will affect their ability to mesh properly when the walls are_erected . 
the outside surface of the solid units shall be of an exterior grade of panel board such_as plywood , plastic coated panel board , high density particle board , asbestos-cement board , or any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building supply dealer . 
the inner panels do not have_to be weatherproof , and the choice will depend_on the quality of finish desire . 
all panel board come in standard * * f foot size . 
it is recommend that panels be both glue as_well as nail to the frame . 
the fixed window panels with louvers should have a good grade of 1 8 - inch double-strength glass set in a mastic glazing compound . 
the louvers are_constructed as show in the detail , with a drop door for ventilation . 
there be standard sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels require them . 
the door panels are design to accommodate standard doors which should be of exterior grade . 
the filler panels for the gable_ends are cut from full * * f sheets as show , leave no wastage . 
the battens cover the joints be of * * f stock and are apply after the walls are_erected . 
all nails should be rustproof , and aluminum is highly recommend . 
note : if 1 2 - inch panel board is use inside and out , or 5 8 - inch one side and 3 8 - inch the other , and 1 8 - inch glass is use , stock lumber in * * f , * * f , and * * f can be use in make the glass panels . 
other thicknesses may necessitate rip a special size lumber for the glass trim . 
in_any_case , there be no special milling or rabbeting require for the panels . 
with modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting_tools , fixtures , and attachments available , the drill press has become a basic home workshop tool . 
the drill press consist_of a vertical shaft ( spindle ) which be tapered or threaded on one end to hold a drill chuck , a tubular housing ( quill ) in_which the spindle is mount , a head in_which the quill is mount , a feed lever which move the quill up or down , a power source , and a movable table upon_which the work is place . 
there be often a means of lock the quill and , on larger presses , the table can be tilt . 
the size of the press is usually express in_terms_of chuck capacity ( the maximum diameter tool shank it will hold ) or distance between the spindle center and the column . 
a press with an 11 inch capacity let you drill to the center of a 22 inch board or circle . 
a new radial drill press with a 16 inch capacity have a tilt head that allow drilling to be do at any angle . 
the head is mount on a horizontal arm that swivel on the supporting column to position the drill_bit instead of the work . 
the drill press should be level and , depending_on whether it be a bench or floor model , bolt securely to a sturdy bench or stand or screw to the floor with lag or expansion screws . 
this will reduce vibration and increase accuracy . 
a coat of paste wax or a rubdown with a_piece of wax_paper will protect the polished surface of the table ; wipe with a slightly oiled cloth will discourage rust of the column and quill . 
presses not fit with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now_and_then in the lubrication holes in the quill . 
the rest of the press should be keep clean by dust with a clean rag or brush . 
be careful to keep the drive belt free_of oil and grease . 
belt tension is adjust by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount . 
keep the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won n't slip when pull by_hand ; excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle bearings . 
most drill presses have a quill return spring that raise the spindle automatically when the feed lever is_released and hold the quill in the raised position . 
the return spring tension may be adjust to suit individual requirements by grip the spring housing with a pair of pliers ( to prevent the spring from unwind when it is_released ) , loosen the lock nut or screw , and rotate the housing until the desired tension is achieve . 
turn the housing clockwise will reduce tension , counter-clockwise will increase it . 
some manufacturers have have the foresight to provide a socket for the chuck key ; otherwise , you 'll have_to spend a_few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the bottom of the motor mount so_that the key be out_of_the_way when not in_use . 
drill speeds be important if you want a good job . 
each cutting_tool will operate best at a given speed , depending_on the material work . 
on most drill presses , it be impossible to get the exact speed , but you can come close_by adjust the drive belt on the step-cone pulleys . 
you will find a chart give the various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere in the instruction booklet that come_with the tool . 
see the table on page 34 for exact recommended speeds . 
generally , the larger the tool and the harder the material , the slower the speed . 
feed pressure be also of major importance . 
too_much pressure will force the tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed or broken tools . 
too light a feed , particularly with metal or other hard material , cause overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting_edge . 
the best results will be obtain by match the correct speed with a steady feed pressure that let the tool cut easily at an even rate . 
there be numerous types and styles of tools to drill holes . 
the_most common be the twist_drill , the solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades , the double spur bit , and the power wood bit . 
all will do a good job if sharp , but the twist_drills do n't cut quite as smoothly as the others , since they do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual boring start . 
the adjustable fly cutter be very useful for cut large diameter holes and can be use to cut exact-size discs by reverse the cutter blade . 
since fly cutters be one sided and not balanced , they should be use at the slowest speed available , and feed very slowly to avoid binding . 
fly cutters can fool you into put your hand too_close to the tool , so if you want to avoid nicked fingers , keep your hands well_out of the way . 
when drill all_the_way through a workpiece , always place a_piece of scrap wood underneath . 
this will not_only protect the work_table , but also assure a clean breakthrough . 
another method of assure a clean hole be to first drill a small pilot hole all_the_way through , then drill half_way with the dimensional bit , turn the piece over , and finish from the other side . 
in soft woods with pronounced grain , there be sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander , due_to the varying hardness of the wood . 
in_this case , drill a small pilot hole or clamp the work will do much to improve accuracy . 
when a hole be to be bore to a predetermined depth , mark the depth on_the_side of the stock , then run the bit down so_that it be even with the mark . 
the depth gauge rod can now be set , and any number of holes bore to exact and identical depth . 
the old-time bridges over the merrimac_river in massachusetts be of unusual interest in many respects . 
for their length , their types of construction , their picturesque settings , and their literary associations , they should be know and remember . 
in_this sequence i shall write_about them in the order of their erection . 
the first bridge known to have been cover wholly or in_part , - and perhaps the_most interesting one , connect newbury ( now newburyport ) with salisbury_point . 
its building was first propose in 1791 , when a group of citizens , mostly newburyport men , petition the general_court for an act of incorporation . 
this document begin : 
'' whereas , a bridge over merrimack_river , from the land of hon ' ble jonathan_greenleaf , esquire , in newbery , to deer_island , and from said island to salisbury , would be of very extensive utility , by afford a safe conveyance to carriages , teams and travellers at_all seasons of the year , and at_all_times of tide . 
`` we , the subscribers , do agree , that as soon as a convenient number of persons have subscribe to this , or a similar writing , we will present a petition to the hon ' ble general_court of the commonwealth of massachusetts , pray for an act incorporate into a body_politic the subscribers to such writing with liberty to build such a bridge , and a right to demand a toll equal_to that receive at malden_bridge , and on like terms , and if such an act shall be obtain , then we severally agree each with the others , that we will hold in the said bridge the several shares set against our respective names , the whole into two hundred shares being divide , and that we will pay such sums_of_money at such times and in such manners , as by the said proposed corporation , shall be direct and require '' . 
this paper was sign by forty-five persons , subscribe a total of two hundred shares . 
a month later the general_court serve notice to the town of newbury that the bridge was to be_built . 
the_matter was consider and reconsider , and finally oppose , but in_spite_of many objections , the court grant a charter on january 9 , 1792 . 
on november 26 of_that year the bridge was complete and open . 
timothy_palmer , who invent and later patent the arch type of construction for wooden bridges , be the genius who plan and supervise the building of the essex , or `` deer_island '' bridge although the actual work was carry_out under the direction of william_coombs , who receive 300 as recompense . 
this two-part bridge is best describe by rev._timothy_dwight , president of yale_college , in his `` travels in new-england and new-york '' , publish in new_haven in 1821 . 
he say of_it : 
`` it consist_of two divisions , separate by an island at a small distance from the southern shore . 
the division between the island and this shore , consist_of principally of an arch ; whose chord be one_hundred and sixty feet , and whose vortex be forty feet ( it be actually 37 feet ) above the high-water_mark . 
in appearance and construction it resemble the pascataqua bridge . 
the whole length of essex bridge be one_thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four . 
i have already mention that mr._timothy_palmer of newburyport be the inventor of the arched bridges in_this country . 
as mr._palmer was educate to house-building only , and had never see a structure of_this nature ; he certainly deserve not a_little credit for the invention '' . 
it be hardly necessary to remind students of covered bridges that timothy_palmer be_born in 1751 in nearby rowley ; that he move with his parents to west_boxford when he be sixteen years old ; and was_there apprentice to a builder and architect , moody_spofford . 
it be indeed a remarkable feat that a man who had have no experience of bridge building should have apply the principle of the arch , which appear in his famous bridges at portsmouth , haverhill , and philadelphia . 
the essex_merrimack_bridge when first build be not cover . 
as far as we know , no american bridge had been thus protect in 1792 . 
richard_s._allen be the authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roof by 1810 . 
its original appearance is_shown in an engraving publish in the `` massachusetts_magazine '' in may 1793 , which is reproduce herewith ( fig. 1 ) . 
a brief description accompany the picture say that the bridge contain more_than 6000 tons of timber . 
between the abutments on the newbury shore and the south bank of deer_island there be one span or arch measure 160 feet ; between the north shore of deer_island and the salisbury side there be an arch of 113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long . 
a dinner and celebration in honor of_this piece of engineering take_place july 4 , 1793 , in a tavern erect by the corporation on the island . 
it is say that the eccentric timothy_dexter , who be one of the first share-holders , stand on the table and made a speech worthy of the occasion . 
the `` essex_journal '' say that he `` deliver an oration on the bridge , which for elegance of style , propriety of speech or force of argument , be truly ciceronian '' . 
the reporter must have write this with tongue in cheek , because dexter 's oration could hardly be_understood ; and , although he later explain that he was talk french , it seem rather more likely that he had succumb to the joys of the evening . 
the north portion of the essex bridge be well worth the cost of construction , although it prove to be twice what was estimate in_the_beginning . 
it stand in its original form until 1882 . 
the southern half , however , on account of its underbracing , was consider by boat owners a menace to navigation . 
in 1810 it was tear_down and replace by a chain suspension_bridge . 
this was_built by john_templeman from plans submit by james_finley of fayette_county , pennsylvania . 
timothy_palmer have general supervision of the work . 
an advertisement in the `` newburyport_herald '' , december 21 , 1810 , show palmer in a new light as an expert on chain bridges . 
it read : 
'' information is hereby give that mr._timothy_palmer of newburyport , mass. has agree to take_charge of the concerns of the patentees of the chain bridge , in the states of massachusetts , new_hampshire , vermont , rhode_island , and connecticut , so_far as relate to the sale of patent_rights and the construction of chain bridges . 
`` mr. palmer will attend_to any applications relate to bridges and if desire will view the proposed site , and lay_out and superintend the work , or recommend a suitable person to execute it . 
john_templeman `` approve , timothy_palmer '' this chain bridge prove less durable than the wooden arch on the salisbury end . 
it fall , february 6 , 1827 , carry with_it a horse and wagon , two men and four oxen . 
the horse and men were save , but the oxen drown . 
in_spite_of this catastrophe , the bridge was rebuild on the same plan and open again on july 17 , 1827 . 
this second chain bridge be 570 feet long , have two thirty-foot towers and a draw , and a double roadway . 
the essex bridge be a toll crossing until 1868 , when the county commissioners lay_out all the merrimack bridges as highways . 
sturdy and strong after more_than a century of continuous use , the old covered , wooden bridge that span the tygartis_valley_river at philippi will have a distinctive part in the week-long observance of the first land battle of the civil_war at its home site , may 28 th to june 3 rd . 
colonel_frederick_w._lander , impersonate , will again make his break-neck ride down the steep declivity of talbott 's ( now college ) hill and thunder across the bridge to join colonel_benjamin_f._kelley 's ( west ) virginia_infantry , then swarm through the streets in pursuit of the retreating confederates . 
he was closely follow by the ohio and indiana troops - thus the old bridge have another distinction ; that of be the first such structure secure by force of arms in the war of the ' 60 s . 
the bridge has survive the natural hazards of the elements , war , fire , and floods , as_well as injuries incident to heavy traffic , for more_than a_hundred years . 
twice during the civil_war it was save from destruction by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister . 
it still stand as a monument to the engineering skills of the last century and still serve in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic on u._s._route 250 - the old beverly and fairmont_turnpike . 
it be one of the very_few , if_not the only surviving bridge of its type to serve a main artery of the u._s. highway_system , thus it be far more_than a relic of the horse and buggy days . 
this covered , wooden bridge is so closely identify with the first action in the early morning of june 3 , 1861 , and with subsequent troop movements of both armies in the philippi area that it has become a part and parcel of the war story . 
so frequently has pictures of the bridge appear in books and in national publications that it vie with the old john_brown_fort at harpers_ferry as the two nationally best known structures in west_virginia . 
complete and open for traffic in 1852 , the bridge was design and build by lemuel_chenoweth and his brother , eli , of beverly . 
the chenoweth brothers be experienced bridge builders , and against the competition of other , and better known , bridge designers and builders they had construct nine of the covered , wooden bridges on the parkersburg and staunton_turnpike a dozen years before , as_well as_many other bridges for several counties . 
the philippi bridge , however , be the chenoweth master piece , with its 139 - foot , dual lane , span - and it stand today as a monument to its builders . 
never rebuild , the bridge was strengthen in 1938 by two extra piers , a concrete floor , and a walk-way along the upper_side in_order_to care for modern traffic . 
during the war it be in constant use by the wagon_trains transport supplies from the railhead at grafton to the troops operate in the interior . 
union soldiers at_times use it for sleeping quarters to escape_from the rain or other inclement weather , and some of them leave momentoes of their stay by carve their names and small tokens on its walls and beams . 
but what the elements could not do was seriously threaten when brigadier_general william_e. ( grumble ) jones reach philippi while on the famous jones-imboden raid in may , 1863 . 
general_jones be fresh from a long series of bridge burnings , include the long bridge at fairmont , and , after see a great drove of horses and cattle he had collect safely across the bridge , he send his men to work pile combustibles in and around it . 
reverend_joshual_corder , a baptist minister , gather a_few citizens of southern sympathies , to call_on jones and plead with him to spare the structure ; he reason and argue , point_out that jones or other confederate commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat . 
jones relent , he did not order his men to apply the torch - the drove of livestock was drive up the valley , via beverly , and across the mountains to feed and serve the confederate army , while jones and his raiders turn toward buckhannon to join forces with imboden . 
again reverend_corder save the bridge when union soldiers plan to destroy it , after fill its two lanes with hay and straw - but for what reason is not record nor remember , certainly not because of pressure from an opposing confederate force . 
on the second occasion it take prayers as_well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their purpose . 
center around this historic old structure , a group of public-spirited barbour_county citizens have organize and plan a week-long series of events , begin on may 28 th and continue through june 3 rd , to observe most appropriately the centennial of the first land engagement of the civil_war at philippi . 
it be a good eight years now since each of us acquire a swimming_pool - eight enlightening , vigorous , rigorous , not wholly unrewarding years . 
we have learn a_lot - a dash of hydrochemistry here , a_bit about plumbing and pump-priming there . 
we have have sound grounding in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy . 
we have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard birds . 
true , our problems have lessen a_bit as more_and_more of our neighbors have build their own pools , thereby dilute our spectacular attractions . 
but problems cling_to pools , as any pool owner know . 
so our innate generosity of spirit prompt us to share our trials , errors and solutions with any who are take the pool plunge for_the_first_time - in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience . 
position may not be everything , but in the case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties , social and / or physical . 
we speak from varying viewpoints . 
one of us have a pool set in a wooded area very near the house . 
the other have his pool far away from the house in a field high on a hill . 
if you are dream of a blue , shimmering pool right outside your living_room windows , close your eyes firmly and fill_in the picture with lots and lots_of children , damp towels , squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated plastic toys . 
you be likely to be nearer the truth . 
you can also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living_quarters , the greater the chance for violation of family privacy , annoying noise and the let 's - make-your-house-our-club attitude . 
on_the_other_hand , out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind when children cannot be easily observe and you have_to make a long trek to reach the pool . 
another dilemma : as picturesque as a sylvan pond in the forest may be , trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being of a pool . 
yet a grassy approach can turn_into a pool into a floating lawn every time the grass is mow . 
as in choose a wife , it be only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is_likely to be in bad_weather as_well as in good . 
in the colder climes , for_instance , you will have_to live through the many unglamorous winter months when your pool will hardly look its best . 
it may be a big hole_in_the_ground filled with salt hay , or an ice_floe stud with logs . 
even a neat , plastic-covered plunge be not exactly a joy to behold . 
( we do , however , recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk - flora and fauna generally - from accidentally winter in the pool . ) 
probably no location for a pool be perfect on all counts . 
naturally it will be dictate to a large extent by the shape and size of your land . 
but if space and money be no problem and small children be not on_hand every_day , it be certainly more restful to have your pool and entertainment area remove from the immediate environs of the house . 
and a good several feet around the pool should be neither greensward nor woods , but good hard pavement . 
the placement of your pool , however , will not of itself solve the two major problems of pool owning - those that involve your social life and those pertain to safety . 
cope_with them demand stern discipline - of yourself as_well as of your family , neighbors , friends and anyone you ever talk to on a transoceanic jet . 
eight years ago while we were go_through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period , we were each solace by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings to a cool family collect around the pool with a buffet table lay_out nearby for the lord and master 's delectation . 
but not even our first pool-side gatherings come anywhere near those rosy fantasies . 
we seem to be witness the population explosion right in our own backyards . 
our respective families look as if they had quadruple . 
had we take a lien on a state park ? 
not_at_all . 
we had merely been discover by the pool sharks . 
we were in business ! 
from proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen be a short step - no_more_than the change from city clothes to trunks . 
nai ^ ve of us , maybe , but the results of our impulsive invitations to `` come over next summer and swim in our new pool '' be both unexpected and unsettling . 
after the first few weeks , it be obvious that rules had_to be make , lay_down and obey - even if our popularity ratings become subnormal as a result . 
so rules we make , in unabashed collusion . 
since our viewpoints in_this respect coincide precisely , we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single social code for pool owners . 
first_and_foremost : no one - no , not anyone - in the family is allow to issue blanket invitations to his or her own circle . 
just short of forty lashes we finally managed to coerce our children to this view . 
their friends and ours be welcome to share the pool , but on our terms and at our times . 
no friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at_least telephone beforehand . 
no ringers , either - even if they are trail legitimate invitees . 
we want_to know when the potlatches telephone exactly how many they are planning to bring , so_that we won n't end_up with a splashing mob that look_like coney_island in august . 
no young children may come without adults except for a specific , organized , chaperoned party . 
and accompanying adults are urge to keep_an_eye_on an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities . 
a gaggle of gabbling mothers , backs to the pool , be no safeguard . 
no bottle pool is tolerate - bottle pool be our lingo for those who come to swim and sink into our bar while protest that they can only dunk and run . 
( sanity , solvency and relations with our wine_merchant take a beating that first summer as we inadvertently become the neighborhood free-drink stop . ) 
we designate one_day a week as the time when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours . 
this has save us from constant requests seven days a week and make us feel less brutal to the young `` less fortunate '' than ours . 
we also work_out logistics for sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoy an alfresco lunch en_famille . 
we gently usher them to an island of tables and chairs strategically place on_the_far_side of the pool where they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides . 
all dressing ( undressing to be more exact ) must be do in our small bath house or at the swimmers ' homes . 
( to avoid any possible excuse for a dripping parade through your house , it be a good idea to have a telephone_extension near the pool as_well as a direct outdoor route between the pool and the parking_area . ) 
we do , however , provide a limited number of extra suits , mainly for children , and we stock extra towels and a_few inexpensive bathing conveniences . 
life-preservers , the buckle-on kapok-filled kind , are hold in readiness , too , for the very young . 
safety rules , of_course , be more important than all the others put_together . 
in many localities , now , the law require all pools to be fence , usually to a minimum height of 5 feet . 
but fenced or unfenced , no pool-side be the place for running or horseplay . 
we allow no underwater endurance_contests , either , or inexpert versions of water_polo . 
diving_boards must have non-skid surfaces ( coco matting take an awful beating from chlorine and rot quickly , but grit-impregnated paints be excellent ) . 
and divers must be enjoin to look before they leap , either on top of someone else or onto a pool edge . 
our pools also have wide , shallow steps - for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus be introduce to the water with far greater safety than a ladder afford . 
all bottles must be keep a safe distance away from the pool and drinking_glasses are ban in favor of plastic or metal cups . 
when you first acquire a pool , we earnestly recommend - for your own mental_health - a good long chat with your insurance_agent . 
you should be prepared to cope_with any pitfall such_as plunges into empty pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as_well as summer lawsuits . 
soignee pools , alas , do not just happen . 
they be the result of a constant and careful contest with the elements . 
unless you want_to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many_of your leisure hours nurse your pool 's pristine purity , its care and feeding - from ph content to filter and vacuum - is best leave to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service . 
of_course , if your pool be close_to the house , your wife can always add it to her housekeeping chores ( you hope ) . 
or you can make pool care the price of swimming for teen-agers . 
even_so , every pool owner , in_case of emergency , should have some idea of_what make things work . 
a brief course in hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciate in a future crisis . 
a sudden high rise in temperature will turn your pool poison green overnight . 
you need more chlorine . 
the walls feel slippery . 
you need algaecide . 
with or without professional help , you will have_to be able to do some of these jobs yourself unless you have a full-time pool nurse . 
you should see_to_it that the trap , the dirt-catcher in_front of the filter , be always clean . 
a pool be no place for a shut trap . 
you should firmly insist that no bobby_pins or hair pins be wear in the water . 
when shed , they leave rust marks . 
you can hope against hope that come spring_cleaning , your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing and furbishing . 
it has happen . 
many hours of spring_cleaning will be save , however , if you remove the main drain grate when you close the pool season in the fall . 
as the pool is empty , stand_by to brush down the walls and bottom while they be still wet . 
much of the dirt and leaf stain is easily remove when damp , but require dynamite if allow to dry . 
if you have a 6 - to 8 - inch drain pipe , you may easily wash_out all the debris when the grate be out . 
of_course , when your 6 - inch torrent of water is release , it may cause a_lot_of comment as it pass_through or by neighboring properties . 
do not forget this possibility . 
if your pool be located on or near sloping ground , it may have natural drainage which be certainly more desirable than to be face with the annual expense and labor of first pump out the water and_then scoop_out all the debris . 
it may be true that pool lighting dramatize an evening scene , but lights also attract all the insect life for miles around . 
once on the water , these little visitors seldom leave , and this add to your filter and vacuum problems as_well as provide a slap good time for all those present . 
often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light you need at much less expense . 
our experience has teach us that it pay to buy the best equipment possible , from pipes to brushes . 
follow pool-care instructions to_the_letter , and be sure that one person ( in the family or not ) be regularly responsible_for each aspect of the job , with no chance for claim , `` it be n't my turn '' . 
never let anyone not in the know take_turns a turn at the valves - even if the little boys do want to play space_ship . 
you may find yourself hit bottom , literally , as you discover that water is run_out even while you are put it in . 
draw a line across_the_country at the latitude of lower pennsylvania . 
any house build now below that line without air conditioning will be obsolete in 10 years . 
fortunately , it be the fha which has arrive_at this conclusion , for it mean that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be include in a mortgage , and thus acquire with a minimum of financial stress . 
even if you live above that line , the fha will back you , for they have decide that the inclusion of air conditioning in_all new homes be a good thing and should be encourage . 
new simplified packaged units , recently devised prefabricated glass-fiber ducts , and improved add-on techniques make it possible to acquire a system for an 1800 - square-foot house for as little as $ 600 to $ 900 . 
two men can often do the installation in a day . 
you can install it yourself - this be a central system that will cool every part of your house . 
its upkeep ? 
no less an authority than the fha concur that the savings air conditioning make possible more_than offset its operating_costs . 
home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflict . 
we know now that a 15 - degree differential in temperature be the maximum usually desirable , and accurate controls assure the comfort we want . 
we know , too , that health is never harm by summer cooling . 
on_the_contrary , there be fewer colds and smaller doctor bills . 
the filtered air benefit allergies , asthma , sinus , hay_fever . 
control of temperature and humidity be a godsend to the aged and the invalid . 
heart_conditions and high_blood_pressure escape the stresses bring_on by oppressive heat . 
housekeeping be easier . 
the cleaner air mean less time spend push a vacuum , fewer trips to the dry_cleaners , lighter loads for the washing_machine . 
the need for reupholstering , redecorating , repainting become more infrequent . 
clothes hold their shape better , and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words . 
it will improve your disposition . 
when you be less fatigued , things just naturally look brighter . 
the children can have their daytime naps and hot meals , and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms . 
you 'll sleep longer and better , too , awake refreshed and free_of hot_weather nerves . 
you can forget about screens , and leave the storm_windows up all year around . 
best_of_all , central air conditioning be something you can afford . 
like its long-lived cousin , the refrigerator , a conditioner can be expect to last 20 to 25 years or more . 
that bring its per-year cost down mighty low . 
no_matter what style your home be , ranch , two-story , colonial or contemporary , central air conditioning is easily install . 
the equipment won n't take_up valuable space either . 
it can go_in out-of-the-way waste space . 
but there 's no denying that the easiest and most economical way to get year - ' round whole-house air conditioning be when you build . 
if that 's done , the house can be design and orient for best operation , and this can mean savings both in the size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself . 
if you can n't see_your_way_clear to have summer cooling include when build , by_all_means make provision for its easy adding later . 
manufacturers have design equipment for just such circumstances , and your savings over start from_scratch will be substantial . 
if your house is to have a forced warm air system , cooling can be a part of_it . 
this cost less_than have a completely separate cooling_system , for your regular heating ductwork , filters and furnace blower do double duty for cooling . 
you can get year - ' round air conditioners in the same variety of styles in_which you buy a furnace alone - high or low boy , horizontal or counterflow . 
the units can be install in basement , attic , crawlspace , or in a closet located in the living area . 
the cooling coil is located in the furnace 's outlet . 
from the coil small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set in the yard , garage , carport , or basement . 
if you plan to add cooling later to your heating_system , there be things to watch for . 
be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are install . 
they may be inaccessible later . 
be sure your ducts and blower be big enough to handle cooling . 
this be especially important if you live in a mild-winter zone . 
be sure you get a perimeter heating_system , and diffusers that will work as_well for cooling as they do for heating . 
you can get a hot water_system that will also work for cool your house . 
for cooling , chilled water is circulate instead of hot water . 
instead of radiators you 'll have cooling-heating units , each with its own thermostat . 
these systems be more expensive than year - ' round forced air systems . 
the minimum cost for an average one-story , 7 - room house with basement , be likely to run $ 1500 above the cost of the heating alone . 
if the problems of combine cooling with your heating be knotty , it may be cheaper to plan on a completely separate cooling_system . 
the simplest kind_of separate system use a single , self-contained unit . 
it be , in_effect , an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts to distribute the cooled , cleaned , dehumidified air where it is want . 
in a long , rambling ranch , two such units can be install , one serve the living area , the other the sleeping zone . 
in a two-story house , one unit may be install in the basement to serve the first_floor , another in the attic to cool the second . 
in each case , have separate systems for living and sleeping areas have the advantage of permit individual zone control . 
one of the more remarkable of the new cooling_systems be one that can be switch to heating . 
as you know , a conditioner make indoor air cool by pump the heat out of_it and_then release this heat outdoors . 
a relatively simple switching arrangement reverse the cycle so_that the machine literally run backward , and the heat is extract from outdoor air and turn indoors . 
up until recently , this heat_pump method of warming air be efficient only in areas of mild winters and when outside temperatures be above 40 degrees . 
now , the machine has been improve to a point where it be generally more economical than oil heat at temperatures down to 15 degrees . 
you can get this added heating feature for as little as $ 200 more_than the price of cooling alone . 
consider it as a standby setup , at negligible cost , for those emergencies when the furnace quit , a blizzard hold_up fuel delivery , or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you do n't want to start_up your whole heating plant . 
how large a cooling unit you need , and the method of its installation , depend_on a variety of factors . 
among_other_things , besides the nature of your house and_how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from_the_outside , it will depend_upon your personal habits and the makeup of your family . 
families with children usually do n't want the house quite so cool . 
if you be a party thrower , you may need added capacity . 
the body be a heat machine , and 20 to 25 guests can easily double your cooling load . 
cooling requirements are best express in_terms_of btu 's . 
a btu be a unit of heat , and the btu rating of a conditioner refer to how much heat your machine can pump out of your house in an hour . 
a very rough rule_of_thumb be that , under favorable conditions , you 'll need 15 btu 's of cooling for every square_foot of your house . 
this be if outdoor temperatures have a high average of 95 degrees . 
you 'll need more if the high average be above that , less if it 's below . 
coolers are also rate by tons . 
a ton of cooling compare to the cooling you get by melt a ton of ice . 
by accepted definition , a 1 - ton conditioner will provide 12000 btu of cooling in one hour . 
you may find a conditioner rate by horsepower . 
it be generally an inaccurate method of rating , for the horsepower be that of the compressor motor , and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you 'll get . 
a 1 - hp conditioner , for_example , may vary in effectiveness from under 8000 btu to well over 10000 btu . 
the safest procedure be to let your builder estimate the size of the unit you need , rather_than try to do this yourself . 
do n't urge your builder to give you a_little extra cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough . 
better to have your equipment slightly undersized than too big . 
here 's why : 
reduce humidity be often as important as cool . 
an oversize unit will cool off your house quickly , then shut_down for a long period . 
before it cycle on again , humidity can build_up and make you uncomfortable even_though the temperature be still low . 
with a unit of the right size , a compressor will run continuously during hot_weather , reduce humidity as evenly as it does temperature . 
attention to details can cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately . 
a well-designed , 1200 - square-foot house can be comfortably cool and heat for as little as $ 128 a year , or $ 11 a month . 
if you have a house which heat does n't penetrate easily , your unit will have less heat to remove . 
keep the direct sun from reach the house and you 've win the first battle . 
in a new house , generous roof overhangs be a logical and effective solution . 
if the house you plan to buy or build won n't have big overhangs , you can still do a fair job of keep the sun off walls and windows with properly designed trellises , fences and awnings . 
shade_trees , too , be a big help , so keep them if you can . 
drawn blinds and draperies do some good , but not_nearly as much_as shading devices on_the_outside of the house . 
the more directly the sun strike walls and roof , the greater its heat impact . 
the way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling you 're going_to need . 
a shift in the walls , or a change in the roof slope , so the sun hit them more obliquely , can save you money . 
you can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun , double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation . 
restrict large glass areas to_the_north and south_sides of the house . 
they 're easier to shade there . 
an attic space above insulation make a house easier to cool . 
you 'll even gain by put your water_heater outside the conditioned space , and use an electric_range instead of a gas one . 
gas add to the moisture load . 
insulate , weatherstrip , double-glaze to the maximum . 
in insulation , the numbers to remember be 6 - 4 - 2 . 
they stand_for 6 inches of mineral_wool insulation in the ceiling , 4 inches in the side walls , 2 inches in the floors . 
such extra-thick insulation not_only permit a much smaller cooling installation , but will continue to reduce operating_expenses both in heating and cooling . 
a light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50 per_cent . 
it cost two to three_times as much to remove a btu in summer as it does to add one in winter , so every solitary btu be worth attention . 
you 'll foil them in droves , along with their pal humidity , by have and use a kitchen_range exhaust_fan , a bathroom ventilator for when you shower , and an outside vent for the clothes drier . 
it 's no use pretend that all conditioners be quiet , but the noise they produce can be keep to a minimum . 
good workmanship be important in the installation , so if you 're do your own contracting , do n't award the job on the basis of price alone . 
avoid attic placement directly above a bedroom . 
in american romance , almost nothing rate higher than what the movie men have call `` meeting cute '' - that_is , boy-meets-girl seem more adorable if it does n't take_place in an atmosphere of correct and acute boredom . 
just_about the_most enthralling real-life example of meeting cute be the charles_macarthur-helen_hayes saga : 
reputedly all he do be give her a handful of peanuts , but he say simultaneously , `` i wish they be emeralds '' . 
aside from the comico-romantico content here , a good linguist-anthropologist could readily pick_up a_few other facts , especially if he have a_little more of the conversation to go_on . 
the way macarthur say his line - if you have the recorded transcript of a professional linguist - would probably have go like this : primary stresses on emeralds and wish ; note pitch 3 ( pretty high ) on emeralds but with a slight degree of drawl , one degree of oversoftness . 
conclusions : the people involved ( and subsequent facts bear_out me out here ) know clearly the relative values of peanuts and emeralds , both monetary and sentimental . 
and the drawling , oversoft voice of flirtation , though fairly overt , be still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture . 
in_other_words , like automation machines design to work in tandem , they share the same programming , a mutual_understanding not_only of english words , but of the four stresses , pitches , and junctures that can change their meaning from black to white . 
at this point , unfortunately , romance become a regrettably small part of the picture ; but consider , if you can bear it , what might have happen if macarthur , for some perverse , undaunted reason , had make the same remark to an eskimo girl in eskimo . 
to her peanuts and emeralds would have be just_so much blubber . 
the point - quite simply - be this : words they might have have ; but communication , no . 
this basic_principle , the first in a richly knotted bundle , was convey to me by dr._henry_lee_smith , jr. , at the university of buffalo , where he head the world 's first department_of_anthropology and linguistics . 
a brisk , amusing man , apparently construct on an ingenious system of spring-joints attune to the same peppery rhythm as his mind , smith begin his academic career teach speech to barnard girls - a project considerably enliven by his devotion to a recording about `` a young rat named arthur , who never could make_up_one's_mind his mind '' . 
later , he become one of the central spirits of the army language program and the language_school of washington 's foreign_service_institute . 
it be there , in the course of try to prepare new men for the `` culture shock '' they might encounter in remote overseas posts , that he first begin to develop a system of chart the `` norms of human communication '' . 
to the trained ear of the linguist , talk has always reveal a staggering quantity of information about the talker - such things as geographical origin and / or history , socio-economic identity , education . 
it be only fairly recently , however , that linguists have develop a systematic way of chart voices on_paper in_a_way that tell even more about the speakers and about the success or failure of human communication between two people . 
this , for obvious reasons , make their techniques superbly useful in study the psychiatric interview , so useful , in_fact , that they have been successfully use to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy . 
in the early 1950 's , smith , together with his distinguished colleague , george_trager ( so austerely academic he sometimes fight his own evident charm ) , and a third man with the engaging name of birdwhistell ( ray ) , agree on some basic premises about the three-part process that make communication : ( 1 ) words or language ( 2 ) paralanguage , a set of phenomena include laughing , weeping , voice breaks , and `` tone '' of voice , and ( 3 ) kinesics , the technical name for gestures , facial_expressions , and body shifts - nod or shake the head , `` talk '' with one 's hands , et cetera . 
smith 's first workout with stresses , pitches , and junctures was base on mother , which spell , in our culture , a good_deal more_than bread alone . 
for_example , if you be a reasonably well-adjusted person , there be certain ways that be reasonable and appropriate for address your mother . 
the usual u._s. norm would be : middle pitches , slight pause ( juncture ) before mother , slight rise at the end . 
the symbols of mother 's status , here , be all usual for culture u._s._a. . 
quite other feelings are evidence by this style : note the drop to pitch 1 ( the lowest ) on mother with no rise at the end of the sentence ; this be a `` fade '' ending , and what you have here be a downtalking style of speech , express something less_than conventional respect for mother . 
even_less regard for mom and mom 's apple_pie go_with : in_other_words , the way the speaker relate to mother is clearly indicate . 
and while the meaning of the words is not in_this instance alter , the quality of communication in both the second and third examples is definitely impair . 
an accompanying record of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a throaty rasp . 
with this seven-word sentence - though the speaker undoubtedly think he was deal only with the subject of food - he was tell things about himself and , in the last two examples , reveal that he had depart from the customs of his culture . 
the joint investigations of linguistics and psychiatry have establish , in_point_of_fact , that no_matter what the subject of conversation be or what words are_involved , it be impossible for people to talk at_all without tell over_and_over_again what sort_of people they be and_how they relate to the rest of the world . 
since interviewing be the basic therapeutic and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry , the recording of interviews for playbacks and study has be a boost of redstone proportions in new research and training . 
some of the earliest recordings , make in the 1940 's , demonstrate that psychiatrists react immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track , whereas written_records of the same interview offer far fewer cues to therapy which - if they be at_all discernible in print - were pick_up only by the_most skilled and sensitive experts . 
in a general way , psychiatrists be able to establish on a wide basis what many_of them had always feel - that the_most telling cues in psychotherapy be acoustic , that such things as stress and nagging are transmit by sound alone and not necessarily by words . 
at a minimum , recording - usually on tape , which be now in wide professional use - bring the psychiatric interview alive so_that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explore repeatedly by the therapist or by a_battery of therapists . 
newest_to this high-powered battery be the experts in linguistics who have carry that minimum to a new level . 
by add a systematic analysis with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews , they have supply a new set of techniques for the therapist . 
linguistic charting of the transcribed interview flags point where the patient 's voice depart from expected norms . 
it flag such possible breakdowns of communication as rehearsed dialogue , the note of disapproval , ambivalence or ambiguity , annoyance , resentment , and the disinclination to speak at_all - this last often mark by a fade-in beginning of sentences . 
interpretation , naturally , remain the role of the therapist , but orientation - not_only the patient 's vocal giveaways of geographical and socio-economic background , but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways of danger spots in his relationship to people - can be considerably beef_up by the linguist . 
his esoteric chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties , make them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient . 
in one now-historic first interview , for_example , the transcript ( reproduce from the book , the first five minutes ) go like this : the therapist 's level tone be bland and neutral - he has , for_example , avoid stress `` you '' , which would imply disapproval ; or surprise , which would set_apart the patient apart from other people . 
the patient , on_the_other_hand , be far from neutral ; aside from her specifically regional accent , she reveal by the use of the triad , `` irritable , tense , depressed '' , a certain pedantic itemization that indicate she have some familiarity with literary or scientific language ( i. e. , she must have have at_least a high-school education ) , and she is tell a story she has mentally rehearse some time before . 
then she catapults_into `` everything and everybody '' , put particular violence on `` everybody '' , indicate to the linguist that this be a spot to flag - that_is , it be not congruent to the patient 's general style of speech up_to this point . 
consequently , it is refer to the therapist for attention . 
he may then very_well conclude that `` everybody '' be probably not the true target of her resentment . 
immediately thereafter , the patient fracture her rehearsed story , veer into an oversoft , breathy , sloppily articulate , `` i do n't feel_like talk right_now '' . 
within the first five minutes of_this interview it be apparent to the therapist that `` everybody '' truthfully refer to the woman 's husband . 
she say later , but still within the opening five minutes , `` i keep think_of a divorce but that 's another emotional death '' . 
the linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery be all present in the voice chart for this sentence ; so be certain signals that she does not accept divorce . 
by say `` another emotional death '' , she reveal that there has be a previous one , although she has not describe it in words . 
this the therapist may pursue in later questioning . 
the phrase , `` emotional death '' , interesting and , to a non-scientific mind , rather touching , suggest that this woman may have some flair for words , perhaps even something of the temperament regrettably called `` creative '' . 
since the psychiatric interview , like any other interview , depend_on communication , it be significant to note that the therapist in_this interview be a man of marked skill and long experience . 
his own communication apparatus operate superbly , and lillian_ross readers will note instantly its total lack of resemblance to the blunted , monumentally unmeshed mechanism of dr._blauberman . 
interestingly enough - although none of the real-life therapists involve could conceivably compare with blauberman - when groups of them begin play_back interviews , they discover any number of ways in_which they want to polish their own interview techniques ; almost everyone , on first hear one of his own sessions on tape , express some desire to take_over the whole_thing over_again . 
yet , in_spite_of this , intensive study of the taped interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid_bare the surprising fact that , in the first five minutes of an initial interview , the patient often reveal as_many as a dozen times just what 's wrong with him ; to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen . 
naturally , the patient does not say , `` i hate my father '' , or `` sibling rivalry be what bug me '' . 
what he does do be give_away himself away by communicate information over and above the words involve . 
some of the classic indicators , as describe by drs._pittenger , hockett , and danehy in the first five minutes , be these : 
stammering or repetition of i , you , he , she , et cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty . 
on_the_other_hand significant facts may be conceal - she may mean i ; or everybody , as it did with the tense and irritable woman mention before , may refer to a specific person . 
the word that_is not use can be as important as the word that_is use ; therapist and / or linguist must always consider the alternatives . 
when someone say , for_example , `` they took x_rays to see that there be nothing wrong with me '' , it pay to consider how this statement would normally be make . 
( this patient , in actuality , be a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accept the fact that it be not her soma but her psyche that be the cause of her difficulty . ) 
amateur linguists note here that pursewarden , in durrell 's alexandria_quartet , stammer when he speak of his wife , which be hardly surprising in_view of their disastrous relationship . 
she be just another freighter from the states , and she seem as commonplace as her name . 
she be the john_harvey , one of those atlantic sea-horses that had sail to bari to bring beans , bombs , and bullets to the u._s._fifteenth air_force , to field_marshal montgomery 's eighth_army then race up the calf of the boot of italy in_that early december of 1943 . 
the john_harvey arrive in bari , a port on the adriatic , on november 28 th , make for porto_nuovo , which , as the name indicate , be the ancient city 's new and modern harbor . 
hardly anyone ashore mark her as she anchor stern-to off berth 29 on the mole . 
if anyone think_of the john_harvey , it was to observe that she was straddle by a pair of ships heavily laden with high_explosive and if they were hit the john_harvey would likely be blow_up with her own ammo and whatever else it be that she carry . 
which be poison_gas . 
it had require the approval of president franklin_delano_roosevelt before the john_harvey could be load with 100 tons of mustard_gas and despatch to the italian warfront . 
for in a world as_yet unacquainted_with the horrors of the mushroom_cloud , poison_gas was still regard_as the ultimate in hideous weapons . 
throughout the early years of world_war 2 , , reports persist that the axis powers had use gas - germany in russia , japan in china again . 
they were always deny . 
influential people in america were warn the pentagon to be prepare against desperation gas attacks by the germans in future campaigns . 
some extremists go so_far as to urge our use it first . 
to silence extremists , to warn the axis , president_roosevelt issue this statement for the allies in august : 
`` from_time_to_time since the present war begin there have be reports that one or more of the axis powers were seriously contemplate use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices of warfare . 
i have be loath to believe that any nation , even our present enemies , could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such terrible and inhumane weapons . 
`` however , evidence that the axis powers are making significant preparations indicative_of such an intention is being report with increasing frequency from a variety of sources . 
`` use of such weapons has been outlaw by the general opinion of civilized mankind . 
this country has not use them , and i hope that we never will be compel to use them . 
i state categorically that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons unless they are first use by our enemies '' . 
the following month the invasion of italy was begin , and roosevelt gave effect to his warning by consent to the stockpiling of poison_gas in southern italy . 
bari was choose as a depot , not_only for its seeming safety , but because of its proximity to airfields . 
any retaliatory gas attack would be airborne . 
it would be make in three waves - the first to lay_down a smokescreen , the second to drop the gas bombs , the third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below . 
so the vile cargo go_into the hole of the john_harvey . 
a detachment of six men from the 701 st chemical_maintenance_company under first_lt._howard_d._beckstrom go aboard , follow by lt._thomas_h._richardson , the cargo_security_officer . 
secrecy be paramount . 
only a_few other people - very important people - know of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestle below decks . 
no one else must know . 
thus , in the immemorial way - in the way of the right_hand that know and the left that does not - was the stage set for tragedy at bari . 
it be the night of december 2 , 1943 , and it was grow dark in bari . 
it was get_on toward 7 o ' clock and the german me-210 plane had be and go on its eighth straight visit . 
capt._a._b._jenks of the office of harbor_defense be very worried . 
he know that german long-range bombers had been return to the attack in italy . 
on november 24 th , they had make a raid on la_maddalena . 
two days later , some 30 of them had strike at a convoy off bougie , sink a troopship - and it had been that very night that the me-210 had made its first_appearance . 
after it had reappear the next two nights , jenks go_to higher headquarters and say : 
`` for three days now a german reconnaissance plane has be over the city take pictures . 
they 're just wait for the proper time to come over_here and dump this place into the adriatic '' . 
but the older and wiser heads had dismiss his warning as alarmist . 
even_though it was know that the luftwaffe in_the_north was now being direct by the young and energetic general_peltz , the commander who would conduct the `` little_blitz '' on london in 1944 , a major raid on bari at this juncture of the war was not to be consider seriously . 
true , there had be raids on naples - but naples be pretty far north on the opposite coast . 
no , bari be out of range . 
more_than that , allied air have complete superiority in the eighth_army 's sector . 
so captain_jenks return to his harbor post to watch the scouting plane put_in five more appearances , and to feel the certainty of_this dread rise within him . 
for jenks know that bari 's defenses were make of paper . 
the royal air_force have but a single light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available . 
there be no r._a._f. fighter squadrons on bari airfield . 
the radar station with the best location be still not serviceable . 
telephone communication be bad . 
and everywhere in_evidence among the few remaining defensive units be that old handmaiden of disaster - multiple command . 
it had been make shockingly evident that very morning to ensign_kay_k._vesole , in charge of the armed guard aboard the john_bascom . 
a british officer had come aboard and tell him that in_case of enemy air_attack he was not to open_fire until bombs were actually drop . 
then he was to coordinate his fire with a radar-controlled shore gun fire white tracers . 
`` this harbor be a bomber 's paradise '' , the britisher had say with frank grimness . 
`` it 's up_to you to protect yourselves . 
we can n't expect any help from the fighters at foggia , either . 
they 're all being use on offensive missions '' . 
vesole had been stun . 
not fire until the bombs come_down ! 
he think_of the tons and tons of flammable fluid beneath his feet and shake his head . 
like_hell ! 
like_hell he 'd wait - and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knock_out ? 
what would his guns guide_on then - the north_star ? 
ensign_vesole decide that he would not tarry until he hear the whispering of the bombs , and when night begin to fall , he put seaman 2 / c donald_l._norton and seaman 1 / c william_a._rochford on the guns and tell them to start shoot the moment they see an enemy silhouette . 
below decks , seaman 1 / c stanley_bishop had begin to write a letter home . 
above decks on the john_harvey , lieutenant_richardson gaze at the lights still burn on the port wall and feel uneasy . 
there be lights glint in the city , too , even_though it was now dark enough for a_few stars to become visible . 
bari was asking_for_it , he think . 
for five days now , they had be in port and that filthy stuff be still in the hold . 
richardson wonder when it would be unload . 
he hope they would put it somewhere way , way down in the earth . 
the burden of his secret was press_down_on him , as it was_on lieutenant_beckstrom and his six enlisted_men . 
lieutenant_richardson could envy the officers and men of the john_harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contain nothing more dangerous than high_explosive bombs . 
they seem happy at the delay in unloading , glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty port such_as bari . 
nine of them had go down the gangplank already . 
deck_cadet_james_l._cahill and seaman_walter_brooks had be the first to leave . 
richardson had return their departing grins with the noncommittal nod that be the security officer 's stock in trade . 
the other half of the crew , plus beckstrom and his men , had remain aboard . 
richardson glance to sea and start slightly . 
damned if that be n't a sailing_ship stand_out of the old harbor - porto_vecchio . 
the night be so clear that richardson have no difficulty make_out the silhouette . 
then the thought of a cloudless sky make him shiver , and he glance upward . 
his eyes boggle . 
it be a clear night and it was rain ! 
capt._michael_a._musmanno , military_governor of the sorrentine_peninsula , had also see and feel the `` rain '' . 
but he had mistake it for bugs . 
captain_musmanno 's renovated schooner with the flamboyant name unsinkable had just leave porto_vecchio with a cargo of badly-needed olive_oil for the sorrentine 's civilian population . 
musmanno be on deck . 
at exactly 7 : 30 , he feel a fluttering object brush his face . 
he snatch at it savagely . 
he turn the beam of his flashlight on_it . 
he laugh . 
it be the silver foil from the chocolate_bar he had been eat . 
he frown . 
but how could - ? 
another , longer strip of tinsel whip his mouth . 
it be two feet long . 
it be not candy wrapping . 
it be `` window '' - the tinsel paper drop by bombers to jam radar sets , to fill the scope with hundreds of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers . 
`` fermate '' ! 
musmanno bellow to his italian crewmen . 
`` stop ! 
stop the engines '' ! 
unsinkable slow and stop , hundreds of brilliant white flares sway eerily down from the black , the air_raid sirens ashore rise in a keening shriek , the anti-aircraft guns coughed and chattered - and above it all motors roar and the bombs come whispering and wailing and crash down among the ships at anchor at bari . 
they had come from airports in the_balkans , these hundred-odd junkers 88 's . 
they had wing over the adriatic , they had take bari by complete surprise and now they were batter her , attack with deadly skill . 
they had ruin the radar warning system with their window , they had make themselves invisible above their flares . 
and they also have the lights of the city , the port wall lanterns , and a shore crane 's spotlight to guide_on . 
after the first two were black_out , the third light was abandon by a terrified italian crew , who leave their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring homing beacon until british mp 's shoot it out . 
in_that interval , the german bombers make a hell of bari harbor . 
merchant_ships illuminate in the light of the flares , make to seem like stones imbed in a lake of polished mud , be impossible to miss . 
the little unsinkable sink almost immediately . 
captain_musmanno roar at his men to lash_together three of the casks of olive_oil together for a raft . 
they get it over the side and clamber aboard only a_few minutes before their schooner go_under . 
john_bascom go_down early , too . 
ensign_vesole and his gunners had fight valiantly , but they had no targets . 
most_of the junkers be above the blinding light of the flares , and the radar-controlled shore gun had been knock_out by one of the first sticks of bombs . 
vesole rush from gun to gun , attempt to direct fire . 
he was wound , but fight on . 
norton and rochford fire wildly at the sounds of the motors . 
bishop rush on deck to grab a 20 mm gun , pump out 400 rounds before sticks of three bombs each crash into holds one , three and five . 
now the bascom was mortally wounded . 
luckily , she be not completely aflame and would go_down before the gasoline could erupt . 
the order to abandon ship was give , but cries of pain could be hear from the wounded below decks . 
`` the food be wonderful and it be a_lot_of fun to be here '' ! 
so write a ten year old student in a letter to his parents from north_country_school , lake_placid , new_york . 
in_this one sentence , he unwittingly reveal the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological programs in_operation at the school . 
because the food is select with thought for its nutritional value , care for its origin , and prepare in a manner that retain the_most nutrients , the food does taste good . 
when serve in a psychological atmosphere that allow young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from what they eat because they be free from tension , a foundation is lay for a high level of health that release the children from physical handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments , the athletic programs and the_most important phase , the educational opportunities . 
situate in a region of some of the loveliest mountain scenery in the country , the school buildings be located amid open fields and farm lands . 
these contemporary structures , beautifully adapt to a school in the country , be home to 60 children , ages eight to fourteen , grades four through eight . 
from fourteen states and three foreign countries they come to spend the months from mid-september to june . 
the director , walter_e._clark , believe that a school with children live full_time in its care must take full responsibility for their welfare . 
to him this mean care for the whole child , provide basic nutrition , and a spiritual attitude that lend freedom for the development of the mind . 
the concept of good nutrition really begin with the garden . 
the school has always maintain a farm to supply the needs of the school . 
in a climate hostile to agriculture , mr._clark has have to keep alert to the_most productive farm techniques . 
where a growing_season may , with luck , allow 60 days without frost , and where the soil be poor , sandy , quick-drying and subject_to erosion , many farmers fail . 
throughout the adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear_witness ghostly testimony that their owners meet defeat . 
mr._clark find that orthodox procedures of deep plowing , use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides , plus the application of conservation principles of rotation and contouring , did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato fields and depreciation of the soil . 
`` to give_up these notions require a revolution in thought '' , mr._clark say in reminisce about the abrupt_changes in ideas he experience when he begin read `` organic_gardening '' and `` modern_nutrition '' in a search for help with his problems . 
`` louis_bromfield 's writings excite me as a conservationist '' . 
by 1952 he be convinced he would no_longer spray . 
he lock his equipment in a cabinet where it still remain . 
after read `` plowman 's folly '' by edward_h._faulkner , he stop plow . 
the basis for compost materials already exist on the school farm with a stable of animals for the riding program , poultry for eggs , pigs to eat garbage , a beef herd and wastes of all kinds . 
separate pails were keep in the kitchen for coffee_grounds and egg shells . 
all these materials and supplementary manure and other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry farms make over 40 tons of finished compost a year . 
it was apply with a compost shredder make from a converted manure spreader . 
years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has change the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity . 
soon after the method change , visitors begin ask how he manage to irrigate his soil to keep it look moist , when in_reality , it be the soil treatment alone that accomplish this . 
to demonstrate the soil of his vegetable_gardens as_it be today , mr._clark stoop to scoop_up a handful of rich dark earth . 
sniff its sweet smell and let it fall to show its good crumbly consistency , he point to the nearby driveway and say , `` this soil used_to be like that hard packed road over there '' . 
`` people and soils respond slowly '' , say walter_clark , `` but the time has now come when the gardens produce delicious long-keeping vegetables due_to this enrichment program . 
no chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides and fungicides are use '' . 
the garden supply enough carrots , turnips , rutabagas , potatoes , beets , cabbage and squash to store for winter meals in the root_cellar . 
the carrots sometimes do n't make_it through the winter ; the cabbage and squash keep until march or april . 
there be never enough corn , peas or strawberries . 
mr._clark still have to use rotenone with potatoes grow on the_least fertile fields , but he has watch the insect damage decrease steadily and hope that continued use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in_the_future . 
a new project plan be the use of bio-dynamic_starter . 
new ideas for improve nutrition come_with the study of soil treatment . 
`` after the soil , the kitchen '' , say mr._clark . 
the first major change be that of provide wholewheat bread instead of white_bread . 
`` adults take a long_time to convince and you are thwart if you try to push '' . 
at_first the kitchen help be tolerant , but order their own supply of white_bread for themselves . 
`` you can n't make french_toast with whole-wheat bread '' , be an early complaint . 
of_course they learn in_time that they not_only could use whole-wheat bread , but the children like it better . 
mrs._clark , as house manager , plan the menus and care for the ordering . 
then miss_lillian_colman come from vermont to be kitchen manager . 
today whole grains are freshly grind every_day and bake into bread . 
mr._clark 's studies teach him that the only way to conserve the vitamins in the whole grain be prompt use of the flour . 
once the grains are grind , vitamin_e begin to deteriorate immediately and half of_it is lose by oxidation and exposure to the air within one week . 
a mill stand in a room off the kitchen . 
surround it be metal cans of grains order from organic farms in the state . 
miss_colman pour measures of whole wheat , oats , and soy_beans and turn_on the motor . 
she go_on about her work and listen for the completion of the grinding . 
the bread bake from this mixture be light in color and fragrant in aroma . 
it is well like by the children and faculty . 
there be one problem with the bread . 
`` lillian 's bread be so good and everything taste so_much better here that it be hard not to eat too_much '' , say the secretary ruefully eye her extra pounds . 
the school has not use cold prepared cereals for years , though at_one_time that be all they ever serve . 
when the chance come , they first eliminate cold_cereal once a week , then gradually convert to hot fresh-ground cereal every_day . 
they serve cracked wheat , oats or cornmeal . 
occasionally , the children find steamed , whole-wheat grains for cereal which they call `` buckshot '' . 
at the beginning of the school_year , the new students do n't eat the cereal right_away , but within a short_time they are eat it voraciously . 
when they leave for vacations they miss the hot_cereal . 
the school has receive letters from parents ask , `` what happen to johnny ? 
he never used_to like any hot_cereal , now that be the only kind he want . 
where can we get this cereal he like so_much '' ? 
salads are serve at_least once a day . 
vegetables are serve liberally . 
most come from the root_cellar or from the freezer . 
home-made sauerkraut is serve once a week . 
sprouted grains and seeds are use in salads and dishes such_as chop_suey . 
sometimes sprouted wheat is_added to bread and cause the children to remark , `` lillian , did you put nuts in the bread today '' ? 
milk appear twice a day . 
the school raise enough poultry , pigs , and beef_cattle for most_of their needs . 
lots_of cheese make from june_grass milk is serve . 
hens are keep on the range and roosters are keep with them for their fertility . 
organ meats such_as beef and chicken_liver , tongue and heart are plan once a week . 
also , salt water fish be on the table once a week . 
for deserts , puddings and pies are each serve once a week . 
most other desserts be fruit in some form , fresh fruits once daily at_least , sometimes at snack time . 
dried_fruits are purchase from sources where they are neither sulphur nor spray . 
apples come from a farm in vermont where they are not spray . 
oranges and grapefruit are ship from florida weekly from an organic farm . 
find sources for these high_quality foods be a problem . 
sometimes the solution come in unexpected ways . 
following a talk by mr._clark at the new_york state_natural_food associates convention , a man from the audience offer to ship his unsprayed apples to the school from vermont . 
wheat-germ , brewer 's yeast and ground kelp are use in bread and in dishes such_as spaghetti_sauce , meat_loaves . 
miss_colman hope to find suitable shakers so_that kelp can be available at the tables . 
raw wheat-germ be available on the breakfast_table for the children to help themselves . 
very_few fried foods are use and the use of salt and pepper is discourage . 
drinking with meals is also discourage ; pitchers of water merely appear on the tables . 
nothing is peel . 
the source is know so there be no necessity to remove insecticide residues . 
the cooking conserve a maximum of the vitamin_c content of vegetables by methods which use very little water and cook in the shortest time possible . 
since mr._clark believe firmly that the chewing of hard foods help develop healthy gums and teeth , raw_vegetables and raw whole-wheat grains are hand_out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat cookies at snack time in the afternoons . 
to solve the problem of the wheat grains spill on the floor and get underfoot , a ball of maple_syrup boil to candy consistency was invent to hold the grains . 
on their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains , the children carry whole grains to munch along the trail . 
they learn to like these so well that it be n't surprising to hear that one boy try the oats he was feed his horse at chore time . 
they taste good to him , so he bring some to breakfast to eat in his cereal_bowl with milk and honey . 
maple_syrup is make by the children in the woods on the school grounds . 
this and raw sugar replace ordinary refined_sugar on the tables and very little sugar is use in cooking . 
candy is not allow . 
parents are ask in the bulletin to send packages of treats consist_of fruit and nuts , but no candy . 
mr._clark believe_in a good full breakfast of fruit , hot_cereal , milk , honey , whole-wheat toast with real butter and eggs . 
the heavy meal come in the middle of the day . 
soup be often the important dish at supper . 
homemade of meat , bones and vegetables , it be rich_in dissolved minerals and vitamins . 
the school find that the children are satisfy with smaller amounts of food since all_of it be high in quality . 
the cost to feed one person be just under one dollar a day . 
even before he see the necessity of grow better food and plan good nutrition , mr._clark feel the school have a good_health program . 
rugged outdoor exercise for an hour and a half every_day in_all kinds of weather be the rule . 
a vigorous program exist in skiing , skating sports and overnight hiking . 
since the change to better nutrition , he feel he can report on improvements in health , though he consider the following statements observations and not scientific proof . 
visitors to the school ask what shampoo they use on the children 's hair to bring_out the sheen . 
the ruddy complexion of the faces also bring comment . 
buffet by swirling winds , the little green biplane struggle northward between the mountains beyond northfield_gulf . 
wires whine as a cold november blast rock the silver wings , but the engine roar was reassure to the pilot bundle in_the_open cockpit . 
he peer ahead and grin as the railroad_tracks come into view again below . 
`` good old iron compass '' ! he think . 
a plume of smoke rise from a central_vermont locomotive which idle behind a string of gravel cars , and little figures that be workmen labor to set the ruptured roadbed to rights . 
the girders of a shattered dog_river bridge lie strewn for half a mile downstream . 
vermont 's main railroad_line be prostrate . 
and in the dark days after the great_flood of 1927 - the worst natural disaster in the state 's history - the little plane be its sole replacement in carry the united_states mails . 
rain of near cloudburst proportions had fall for three full days and it was still rain on the morning of friday , november 4 , 1927 , when officials of the post_office_department 's railway_mail_service realize that their distribution system for vermont had been almost totally destroy overnight . 
clerks and postmasters shovel muck out of their offices - those who still have offices - and wonder how to move the mail . 
the state 's railroad system count miles of broken bridges and missing rights-of-way : it would obviously remain out of commission for weeks . 
and once medicine , food , clothing and shelter had been provide for the flood 's victims , communications and the mail be the next top problems . 
from burlington , outgoing mail could be ferry across lake_champlain to the railroad at port_kent , n._y. . 
but what come_in was pile_up . 
the nearest undisrupted end of track from boston be at concord , n._h. . 
when governor_al_smith offer new_york national_guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state , it seem a likely temporary solution , ease burlington 's bottleneck and that at montpelier too . 
the question be `` where to land '' ? 
there be no such thing as an airport in vermont . 
burlington aviator john_j._burns suggest the parade_ground southwest of fort_ethan_allen , and soon a dozen hastily-summoned national_guard pilots were bring their wide-winged `` jenny '' and dehaviland two-seaters to rest on the frozen sod of the military base . 
the only available field that could be use near flood-ravaged montpelier be on the towne farm off upper main_street , a narrow hillside where takeoffs and landings could be safely make only under light wind conditions . 
over in barre the streets had be deep in swirling water , and bridges be crumpled and gone . 
anticipate delivery of medicines and yeast by plane , granite_city citizens form an airfield committee and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172 nd infantry , vermont national_guard , lay_out runways on wilson flat , high on millstone_hill . 
the `` barre_aviation_field '' was set_to receive its first aircraft the sunday follow the flood . 
though the makeshift airports be ready , the york_state_guard flyers prove unable to keep any kind_of mail schedule . 
they have courage but their meager training consist_of weekend hops in good_weather , in and out of established airports , and the increasingly cold_weather soon raise hob with the water cooled engines of their world_war 1 , planes . 
it seem like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empower the post_office_department to contract for the transport of first_class mail by air . 
they had_to act fast , for letters were clog the terminals . 
down in concord , new_hampshire , be a flier in the right place at the right time : robert_s._fogg , a native new_englander , had be a world_war 1 , flying instructor , barnstormer , and one of the original planners of the concord_airport . 
tall , wiry , dark-haired bob_fogg had already rack_up one historical first in air_mail history . 
pilot a curtiss_navy_mf flying_boat off lake_winnipesaukee in 1925 , he had inaugurate the original rural delivery air service in america . 
during the excitement follow lindbergh 's flight to paris earlier in 1927 , dare devil aviators overnight become legendary heroes . 
in concord , bob_fogg be the_most prominent new_hampshire boy with wings . 
public-spirited backers stake him to a brand-new airplane , aim at put their city and state on the flying map . 
the ship be a waco biplane , one of the first two of its type to be fit with the air cooled , 225 hp_wright radial_engine known as the whirlwind . 
a trim green and silver-painted craft only 22 - 1 2 feet long , the waco was enter to compete in the `` on-to-spokane '' air_derby of 1927 . 
as_a_matter_of_fact , fogg and his plane did n't get beyond pennsylvania in the race - an engine oil leak force him down - but the flying service and school he start subsequently be first_steps in pay_off his wry-faced backers . 
so with all this experience , bob_fogg be a natural choice to receive the first emergency air_mail star_route contract . 
his work begin just six days after the flood . 
by airline from concord to burlington be a distance of about 150 miles , count a slight deviation for the stop at either barre or montpelier . 
the first few days bob_fogg set_down his plane down on towne field back of the state_house when the wind be right , and use wilson flat above barre when it be n't . 
between the unsafe towne field and the long roundabout back road haul that be necessary to gain access to wilson flat , arrangements at the state_capital be far from satisfactory . 
each time in , the unhappy pilot , push his luck , beg the postal officials that meet him to find a safer landing_place , preferably on the flat-topped hills across the winooski_river . 
`` but fogg '' , they counter , `` we can n't get_over there . 
and besides you seem to make_it all_right here '' . 
it take a tragedy to bring things to a head . 
after a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind takeoffs , fogg one_day look down at the shattered yellow wreckage of an army plane strew across snow-covered towne field . 
send to montpelier by secretary_herbert_hoover , red_cross aide_reuben_sleight had been kill , and his pilot , lt._franklin_wolfe , badly injure . 
with the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply fly into the hillside . 
face with this situation , postmaster_charles_f._mckenna of montpelier go with fogg on a burlington trip , and together they scout the terrain on the heights of berlin . 
a long flat known as the st._john field seem to answer their purpose , and since the winooski bridges be at_last passable , they decide to use it . 
with a wary eye on the farmer 's bull , fred_somers of montpelier and mr._st._john mark the field with a red table cloth . 
as a wind direction indicator , they tie a cotton rag to a sapling . 
with these aids , and a pair of skiis substitute for wheels on the waco , bob_fogg make the first landing on what be now part of the barre-montpelier_airport on november 21 , 1927 . 
each trip see the front cockpit fill higher with mail_pouches . 
during the second week of operations , fogg receive a telegram from the post_office_department , ask him to `` put_on two airplanes and make two flights daily , plus one sunday trip '' . 
since fogg 's be a one-man , one-plane flying service , this mean that he would have to do both trips , fly alone 600 miles a day , under sub-freezing temperature conditions . 
over the weeks , america 's first star_route air_mail settle into a routine pattern despite the vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation . 
each morning at five fogg crawl out_of_bed to bundle into flying togs over the furnace register of his home . 
always trouble by poor circulation in his feet , he experiment with various combinations of socks and shoes before finally adopt old-style felt farmer 's boots with his sheepskin flying boots pull over them . 
a sheep-lined leather flying suit , plus helmet , goggles and mittens complete his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit . 
the airman 's stock answer to `` were n't you cold '' ? become `` yes , the first_half hour be tough , but by then i be so numb i do n't notice it '' ! 
as daylight begin to show through the frosty windows , fogg would place a call to william_a._shaw at the u._s. weather_station at northfield , vermont , for temperature and wind-velocity readings . 
shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility by a visual check of the mountains to be see from his station . 
`` ceilings '' were judge by comparison with known mountain heights and cloud positions . 
later_on in the day fogg could get a better weather picture from the burlington weather_bureau supervise by frank_e._hartwell . 
out at the airport each morning , fogg 's skilled mechanic caleb_marston would have the waco warm_up and run in the drafty hangar . 
( he 'd get the engine oil flow with an electric_heater under a big canvas cover . ) 
wish to show that aviation be dependable and here to stay , bob_fogg always make a point of take_off each morning on the dot of seven , disregard rain , snow and sleet in true postal tradition . 
concord learn to set its clocks by the rackety bark of the whirlwind 's exhaust overhead . 
sometimes the pilot had_to turn_back if fully block by fog , but 85  of his trips were complete . 
plane radios be not_yet available , and once in_the_air , fogg fly his ship by compass , a good memory for landmarks as see from above , and a capacity for dead_reckoning and quick computation . 
often , thread through the overcast , he was force to fly close_to the ground by a low ceiling , skim above the winooski or the white_river along the line of the broken railroad . 
when driving rain or mist sock in one valley , fogg would chandelle up and over to reverse course and try another one , range from the ottauquechee up_to danville in search of safe passage through the mountain_passes . 
the dependable wright engine was never stop on these trips . 
it tick over smoothly , idle while fogg exchange mails with the armed messenger from burlington at fort_ethan_allen , and one from montpelier and barre at the st._john field . 
sometimes , on a return trip , the aviator would `` go upstairs '' high over the clouds . 
there he 'd take a compass heading , figure his air speed , and deduce that in a certain number of minutes he 'd be over the broad meadows of the merrimack_valley where it would be safe to let_down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him . 
bob_fogg did n't have today 's advantages of instrument_flight and ground_control_approach systems . 
at the end of the calculated time he 'd nose the waco down through the cloud_bank and hope to break_through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable . 
usually back in concord by noon , there be just time to get partially thawed out , refuel , and grab a_bit of mrs._fogg 's hot broth before start the second trip . 
day_after_day fogg shuttle back_and_forth on his one-man air_mail route , until the farmers in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen come to recognize the stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country . 
the flyer have his share of near-misses . 
at fort_ethan_allen the ever-present wind off lake_champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing like an airplane if the pilot miscalculate . 
once the soldiers from the barracks had_to hold the ship from blow away while fogg rev the engine and get the tail up . 
at a nod of his head they let_go , turn to cup their ears against the icy slipstream . 
tracks in the snow show the plane be airborne in less_than a_hundred feet . 
one afternoon during a cold , powdery snowstorm , fogg take_off for concord from the st._john field . 
are you retire now ? 
if so , are you say , `` where did the last few years go ? 
how did i get to be sixty-five so fast ? 
what do i do now '' ? 
yes , retirement seem to creep upon you suddenly . 
somehow we old-timers never figure we would ever retire . 
we always think we would die with our boots on . 
out_of_the_blue come talk of pension plans . 
compulsory retirement at sixty-five loom on our horizon . 
still , it seem in the far future . 
suddenly , one_day , up it pop_up ! 
sixty-five years and you 've had_it ! 
so , now what ? 
oh sure ! 
you 've think_about it before in a hazy sort_of way . 
but ! 
it never seem real ; never seem as if it could happen to you ; only to the other fellow . 
now ! 
here it be ! 
how am i going_to live ? 
what am i going_to do ? 
where do i go from here ? 
a great many retired people be the so-called white collar workers . 
are you one of these ? 
if so , you be of the old_school . 
you be conscientious , hard working , honest , accurate , a good penman , and a stickler for a job well do , with no loose_ends . 
everything must balance to the last penny . 
also you can spell , without consult a dictionary for every_other word . 
you never be late for work and seldom absent . 
actually , you can take no special credit for this . 
it be the way you were teach and your way_of_life . 
all this be standard equipment for a man of your day ; your stock in trade ; your livelihood . 
however , the last few years of your life , things seem to be change . 
your way does n't seem to be so darned important any_more . 
you realize you are get_in the old fogy class . 
to put it bluntly , you are get out-moded . 
what 's happen ? 
the answer be a new era . 
now , loom on the horizon be such things as estimated totals , calculated risks and i._b._m. machines . 
the planning_dept. come into existence . 
all sorts of plans come_to_life . 
this is follow by a boom in conferences . 
yes sir ! 
conferences become very popular . 
when a plan burst its seams , hasty conferences supply the necessary patch , and life go_on merrily on . 
that be called progress ! 
the new way_of_life ! 
let 's face it ! 
you have your day and it be a good_day . 
let this generation have theirs . 
time march_on ! 
well , to get_back to the problem of retirement . 
every retiring person have a different situation face him . 
some have plenty of money - some have very little money . 
some be blest with an abundance of good_health - some be in poor health and many be invalids . 
some have lovely homes - some live in small apartments . 
some have beautiful gardens - some not even a blade of grass . 
some have serenity of mind , the ability to accept what they have , and make the most of it ( a wonderful gift to have , believe me ) - some see only darkness , the bitter side of everything . 
well , whatever you have , that 's it ! 
you 've got_to learn to live with_it . 
now ! 
the question be `` how are you going_to live with_it '' ? 
you can sit_back and moan and bewail your lot . 
yes ! 
you can do this . 
but , if you do , your life will be just one thing - unhappiness - complete and unabridged . 
it seem to me , the first thing you 've got_to do , to be happy , be to face_up to your problems , no_matter what they may be . 
make_up_one's_mind your mind to pool your resources and get the_most out of your remaining years of life . 
one thing , i be sure of , you must get an interest in life . 
you 've got_to do something . 
many_of you will say , `` well , what can i do '' ? 
believe me ! 
there be many , many things to do . 
find_out what you like to do most and really give_it_a_whirl . 
if you can n't think_of a thing to do , try something - anything . 
maybe you will surprise yourself . 
true ! 
we be not all great artists . 
i , frankly , can n't draw a straight_line . 
maybe you be not that gifted either , but how about putter_around with the old paints ? 
you may amaze yourself and acquire a real knack for it . 
anyway , i 'll bet you have a_lot_of fun . 
do you like to sew ? 
does make your own clothes or even doll clothes , interest you ? 
do you love to run_up a hem , sew on buttons , make neat buttonholes ? 
if you do , go_to_it . 
there be always a market for this line_of_work . 
some women can sit and sew , crochet , tat or knit by_the_hour , and look calm and relaxed and turn_out beautiful work . 
where sewing is_concerned , i be a total loss . 
when you see a needle in my hands you will know the family buttons have fall_off and i have_to sew them back on , or get_out the safety_pins . 
then_again , there 's always that lovely old pastime of hook or braid rugs . 
not for me , but perhaps just the thing for you . 
well ! 
how 's about mosaic tile , ceramics or similar arts and crafts ? 
some people love to crack tile and it 's amazing what beautiful designs they come_up with as a result of their cracking good time . 
how about the art of cooking ? 
do you yearn to make cakes and pies , or special cookies and candies ? 
there be always an open market for this sort_of delicacy , in_spite_of low calorie diets , cottage_cheese and hands-off-all-sweets to_the_contrary . 
some people can carve most anything out of a_piece of wood . 
some make beautiful chairs , cabinets , chests , doll houses , etc. . 
perhaps you could n't do that but have you ever try to see what you could do with a hunk of wood ? 
outside of cut your fingers , maybe you would come_up with nothing at_all , but then_again , you might turn_out some dandy little gadgets . 
some women get a real thrill out of housework . 
they love to dust , scrub , polish , wax floors , move the furniture around from_place_to_place , take_down the curtains , put_up new ones and have themselves a real ball . 
maybe that 's your forte . 
it certainly is n't mine . 
i can look at furniture in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure that 's where it belong . 
perhaps you would like to become a writer . 
this give you a wide and varied choice . 
will it be short_stories , fiction , nonfiction , biography , poetry , children 's stories , or even a book if you be really ambitious ? 
ever since i be a child , i have always have a yen to try my hand at writing . 
if you do decide to write , you will soon become acquainted_with rejection slips and dejection . 
do n't be discourage ! 
this be just be a normal writer . 
just let the rejection slips fall where they may , and keep_on plug , and finally you will make the grade . 
few new writers have their first story accept , so they tell me . 
but , it could happen , and it may happen to you . 
then there 's always hobbies , collect stamps , coins , timetables , salt and pepper shakers , elephants , dogs , dolls , shells , or shall we just say collect anything your heart desire ? 
i can hear some of you folks protest . 
you say , `` but it cost a_lot_of money to have a hobby . 
i have n't get that kind_of money '' . 
true ! 
it does cost a_lot_of money for most hobbies but there be hobbies that be for_free . 
how about a rock collection , or a collection of leaves from different trees or shrubs and in different colors ? 
then , take flowers . 
they be many and varied . 
also , there 's scrap books , collecting newspaper pictures and clippings , or any items of interest to you . 
it 's get interested in something that count . 
as for me , i am hold in reserve two huge puzzles ( i love puzzles ) to put_together when time hang heavy on my hands . 
so_far , the covers have never be off the boxes . 
i just do n't have time to do half the things i want to do now . 
so in closing , fellow retired members , i advise you to make the most of each_day , enjoy each one to the n't h degree . 
travel , if you can . 
keep occupied to_the_point you be not bored with life and you will truly find these final days and years of your lives to be sunshine sweet . 
good_luck ! 
to one and all - good_days ahead ! 
an important criterion of maturity be creativity . 
the mature person be creative . 
what does_it mean to be creative , a term we hear with increasing frequency these days ? 
when we turn_to noah_webster we find him helpful as_usual . 
`` to be creative be to have the ability to cause to exist - to produce where nothing be before - to bring_forth an original production of human intelligence or power '' . 
we be creative , it seem , when we produce something which has not previously exist . 
thus creativity may run all_the_way from make a cake , build a chicken_coop , or produce a book , to found a business , create a league of nations or , develop a mature character . 
all living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence the power of creativity , if it be only to reproduce a form like their own . 
while man share this procreative function with all his predecessors in the evolutionary process , he be the only animal with a true non-instinctive and conscious creative ability . 
an animal , bird or insect create either a burrow , or nest or hive in unending sameness according to specie . 
man 's great superiority over these evolutionary forbears be in the development of his imagination . 
this give him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories , ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and ever-changing forms . 
it has been truly say that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by project this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world . 
in our own time we have see the_most fantastic imagery of a jules_verne come into actuality . 
the vision of a lord_tennyson express in a poem 100 years ago take_form visible form over london in_the_air blitzes of 1941 . 
in_fact all_of our civilized world be the resultant of man 's projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more . 
it be in_this one aspect , at_least , that man seem to be make in the image of his creator . 
not_only can man project his imagination out into his environment in concrete forms , but even more importantly , he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself . 
we recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training can become athletes , acrobats , dancers , musicians and artists , develop many potentialities . 
we know that actors can learn to portray a wide variety of character roles . 
by this same combination of the will and the imagination , each one of us can learn to portray permanently the kind_of character we would like to be . 
we must realize with prof._charles_morris in his the open_self that `` man be the being that can continually remake himself , the artisan that be himself the material for his own creation '' . 
so_far in history man has be too greatly over-occupied with project things into his environment rather_than first create the sort_of person who can make the highest use of the things he has create . 
is not the present world crisis a race between things we have create which can now destroy us and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall the tragedy . 
is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend our weight to be creative on the character side and to hasten our own maturing process ? 
sir_julian_huxley in his book uniqueness of man make the novel point that just_as man be unique in be the only animal which require a long period of infancy and childhood under family protection , so be he the only animal who have a long period after the decline of his procreativity . 
some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples be a thing of the remote , victorian past ; that nowadays all honeymooners be thoroughly familiar_with the best sex-manuals and know enough from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all the anxiety and hazards out of the situation . 
perhaps - but extensive discussions with contemporary practitioners , family_doctors and gynecologists indicate that this be still an area of enormous ignorance . 
joking and talking may be freer and easier , but the important factual information be still lacking for far too many newly-married men and women . 
various factors in the setting can still be of great advantage in make the first intercourse a good rather_than a bad memory for one or both . 
privacy must be highly assure both in_time and place . 
that_is , lock the room or stateroom door give privacy of location , but it be equally important to be sure there be time enough for an utterly unhurried fulfillment . 
if the wedding_party last late , and the travel schedule mean there be only a_few hours before resume the trip or make an early start , the husband may forestall tensions and uncertainties by confide to his bride that lie in each other 's arms will be bliss enough for these few hours . 
the consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long private time ( day or night ) for that purpose . 
first intercourse for the bride bring with it the various problems connect with virginity and the hymen . 
one thing should be clear to both husband and wife - neither pain nor profuse bleeding has_to occur when the hymen is rupture during the first sex_act . 
ignorance on this point has cause a great_deal of needless anxiety , misunderstanding and suspicion . 
the hymen be , in_essence , a fragile membrane that more_or_less completely cover the entrance to the vagina in most female human_beings who have not have sex relations . 
( hymen , in_fact , be the greek word for membrane . ) 
often it be thin and fragile and give_way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse . 
as_might_be_expected , girls in_this situation bleed very little and perhaps not_at_all in the process of lose their virginity . 
it be also important to realize that many girls be_born without a hymen or at_most only a tiny trace of one ; so_that the absence of the hymen be by_no_means positive proof that a girl has have sex relations . 
but there be a basis in_fact for the exaggerations of the folk-lore beliefs . 
some hymens be so strongly developed that they cannot be tear without considerable pain to the girl and marked loss of blood . 
more rarely , the hymen be so sturdy that it does not yield to penetration . 
extreme cases be on record in_which the doctor has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital relations_to be consummate . 
these cases , for all their rarity , be so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen be a serious problem to newly-weds . 
in_recent_times , when sexual matters begin to be discuss more scientifically and more openly , the emotional aspects of virginity receive considerable attention . 
obviously , the bridal pair have many adjustments to make to their new situation . 
is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of make the loving husband the one who bring pain to his bride ? 
gynecologists and marriage manuals begin to advise that the bride should consult a physician before marriage . 
if he foresee any problem because of the quality of the hymen , it was recommend that simple procedures be undertake at_once to incise the hymen or , preferably , to dilate it . 
as a natural outgrowth of_this approach it was often suggest that the doctor should complete the preparation for painless intercourse by dilate the vagina . 
this recommendation was base on the fact that the hymen be not the only barrier to smooth consummation of the sex_act . 
the vagina be an organ capable_of remarkable contraction and dilation . 
this be obvious when it be remembered that , during childbirth , the vagina must dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby . 
the intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina be partly under voluntary control . 
but an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious intention of the woman . 
that_is , when first penetration take_place , the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent further pain . 
the advantages of dilatation by the physician be both physical and psychological . 
since it be a purely professional situation , none of the pain is associate with love-making or the beloved . 
by use instruments of gradually increasing size , the vagina is gently , and with minimum pain at each stage , teach to yield to an object of the appropriate shape . 
in_this process the vaginal muscles come under better conscious control by the girl . 
she learn how to relax them to accept - instead of contract them to repel the entering object . 
apart from the standard problem of control the vaginal muscles , other serious barriers may exist that need special gynecological treatment . 
it be far better to have such conditions treat in_advance than to have them show_up on the honeymoon where they can create a really serious situation . 
when no medical problems exist , the newly married_couple generally prefer to cope_with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves . 
special information and guidance about the possible difficulties be still of great value . 
folk-lore , superstition and remembered passages from erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly take as scientific facts and useful hints . 
the importance of loving tenderness be obvious . 
the long , unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels . 
under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relax and dilate and the local moisture greatly increase , provide an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration . 
extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have establish the fact that a single finger insert along the anterior wall ( the top line of the vagina as the woman lie on her back ) may cause a great_deal of distress in a virgin . 
but during the same examination , two fingers may be insert along the posterior wall ( the bottom of the vagina in the same position ) without any pain ; and in_fact without any difficulty if the pressure is keep downward at_all_times . 
these regional differences of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse . 
the husband and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in mind . 
they may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too_much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina ; at_least until repeated intercourse has dilate it and pain be no_longer a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making . 
in_fact , the technical procedure in medical_examinations may be wisely adapt to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon . 
locker-room talk often stress the idea that a man is do the girl a favor if he be forceful and ruthless during the first penetration . 
the false reasoning be that a gradual advance prolong the pain while a swift powerful act get it over with and leave the girl pleased with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settle the problem once_and_for_all . 
such talk be seriously in error . 
ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride , both physically and psychologically . 
the insistent , forceful penetration may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as_well as do excessive damage to the hymen . 
the pain and distress associate with the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital relations and cause her , unconsciously , to make the sex_act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercise her vaginal muscles to complicate his penetration instead of relax them to facilitate it . 
serious attention must also be give to the husband 's problems in the honeymoon situation . 
the necessity for keep alert to his bride 's hazards can act_as an interference with the man 's spontaneous desire . 
the emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience a premature climax . 
this be a very common experience and should in_no_way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife . 
or the frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period . 
the signals to proceed may therefore come when he be momentarily not able to take_advantage in them . 
the best course be to recover his physical excitement by a change of pace that make him ardent again . 
this may require imagination and remind himself that now he can be demanding and self-centered . 
he can take security from the fact that the progress he has make by his gentle approach will not be lose . 
now while he use talk , caresses or require caresses from her , his bride will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they both so eagerly desire . 
a final word . 
the accumulated information on this point show that first intercourse , even when it is achieve with minimum pain or difficulty , be seldom an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman . 
too many new things are happen for it to be a complete erotic fulfillment . 
only under rare circumstances would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse . 
both man_and_wife should be aware_of the fact that a lack of climax , and even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure be not a sign that the wife may be cold or frigid . 
if the early approaches be wise , understanding and patient , the satisfactions of marital fulfillment will probably be discover before the marriage be much older . 
write in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures , titled the nude : a study in ideal form , kenneth_clark declare : `` he human_body , as a nucleus , be rich_in associations . 
it be ourselves and arouse memories of all the things we wish to do with ourselves '' . 
perhaps this be a clue to the amazing variety and power of reactions , attitudes , and emotions precipitate by the nude form . 
the wide divergence of reactions is clearly illustrate in the kinsey studies in human sexuality . 
differences were_related to social , economic , and educational backgrounds . 
whereas persons of eighth grade education or less be more apt to avoid or be shock by nudity , those educate beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcome and approve nudity in sexual_relations . 
such understanding help to explain why one matron celebrate thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that her husband had `` never see her entirely naked '' , while another woman , boast an equal number of years of married life , be proud of having `` share the nudist way_of_life - the really free , natural nude life - for most_of that period '' . 
attempts at censorship always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions . 
the indignant crusader see the nude or semi-nude human form as `` lewd and pornographic , a threat and danger '' to all the young , or good , or religious , or moral persons . 
the equally ardent proponent of freedom from any kind_of censorship may find the nude human form the `` natural , honest , free expression of man 's spirit and the epitome of beauty and inspiration '' . 
one be always a_little surprised to bump into such individual distinctions when it be unexpected . 
i still recall the mild shock i experience in read material of an enthusiastic advocate of the `` clean , healthful , free way of natural life in nudism '' , who seem to brave much misunderstanding and persecution in fine spirit . 
she give herself a title - lady_diana_harrington . 
the new_york d._a. give her another-the golden_girl of cafe society . 
houston police give her a third , less flamboyant , title - prostitute . 
and houston police have the final say in the_matter since she die there on september 20 , 1960 , `` diane_harris_graham , 30 , d._o._a. circumstances - unusual '' . 
early in her life she had discover that where there be men , there be money , and with the two come luxury and liquor . 
she be still in the play for pay business when she die , a top trollop who had give the world 's oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour . 
she never hide the fact that she like to play . 
her neighbors in the expensive houston apartment_building tell reporters that the ash-blonde beauty had talk at_times about her past as `` the golden_girl of the mickey_jelke trial '' . 
it be the trial of oleomargarine heir minot ( mickey ) jelke for compulsory prostitution in new_york that put the spotlight on the international play-girl . 
( jelke later serve 21 months when he was find guilty of mastermind a ring of high-priced call_girls . ) 
diane was need as a material witness in the case and new_york police search three continents before they find her in their own back yard - in a swank hotel , of_course . 
she had been move in cafe society as lady_diana_harrington , a name that make some of the gossip columns . 
it be when she was seize as a material witness that she get the designation she like best . 
clothe in mink and diamonds , she listen to assistant district_attorney anthony_liebler describe her to the arraigning judge : 
`` this girl be the golden_girl of cafe society . 
`` in 1951 she be a prostitute in new_york county . 
in the spring and early summer of_that year she meet a wealthy foreign tycoon who take her to france , where she later meet a very wealthy_man and tour all europe with him . 
`` at deauville she meet an egyptian by the name of pulley_bey . 
he be the official procurer for king_farouk , now in exile . 
she be in egypt during the revolution and have passport difficulty . 
she lie in order to get it . 
`` we have check her in different parts of europe and egypt and finally back into this country . 
she has been act_as a prostitute . 
`` our information be that she give the proceeds of her acts to jelke '' . 
diane sobbingly deny this to the court . 
`` that 's a lie . 
i never give that boy a cent . 
i be not a prostitute , and i have only one very wealthy boy friend '' , she say . 
during the course of the trial , jelke back_up part of_that statement . 
`` diane be the type of girl '' , jelke say , `` who would n't get loving - even on her wedding night - unless you pile_up all your money in_the_middle of the floor '' . 
but she seem to have underestimate the number of her `` boy friends '' . 
she come to new_york from detroit as a teenager , but with a `` sponsor '' instead of a chaperone . 
as she tell it , `` he be a rich boy friend , an old guy about 60 '' . 
she be mary_lou_brew then , wide-eyed , but not naive . 
she had talk_into her `` boy friend '' into send her to new_york to take a screen_test . 
the screen_test was never make - but diane was . 
she quickly move into cafe society , possibly ease her conscience by talk constantly of her desire to be in show_business . 
she seem so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail circuit set_up a practical_joke . 
an ex-fighter was introduce to her in a bar as `` mr._warfield , the famous producer '' . 
the phony producer ask her if she would like to be in one of his shows . 
`` i 'd love to audition for you '' , she gush . 
the audition was hold a_few minutes later in somebody 's apartment . 
she think she have great possibilities in the ballet and want to show the eminent producer how well she could dance . 
after a_few minutes he say , `` i can n't use you if you dance like that . 
i 'd like to see you dance nude '' . 
she hastily comply . 
diane love to dance in the nude , something she was to demonstrate time_and_again . 
she develop another quaint habit . 
even among the fast set in which she was move , her method for keep an escort from depart too early be unique . 
when the date would try to bid her good-night at the door , she would tell him , `` if you go_home now , i 'll scream '' . 
more_often_than_not he would bow to the inevitable . 
one who need no such threats be a french financier . 
one of the blonde 's yearnings that he satisfy was for travel . 
she want to go around the world , but she settle for a french holiday . 
in an anonymous interview with a french newspaper the financier tell of spend several months with her . 
`` then she go to deauville where she meet a member of a powerful greek syndicate of gamblers '' . 
the greek evidently fall_for her , `` monsieur x '' recount , and to clinch what he think be an affair in the make he give her 100000 francs ( about $ 300 ) and lead her to the roulette tables . 
she could do no wrong at the tables that time . 
and in_short_order the croupier had push several million francs her way . 
smarter than most gamblers , she slip_away from the casino , pack her bag and take the night train to paris . 
no one ever learn what happen to the greek . 
the luxury of paris ' most fashionable hotel , the george 5 , , bore the beautifully-built blonde , so she high-tail it to rome . 
she team_up with another beauty , whose name has been lose to history , and commence with some fiddling that would have make nero envious . 
to climax her roman revels , she was throw_out of the swanky hotel_excelsior after she had run naked through its marble halls scream for help . 
it be a rugged finish for what must have be a very interesting night . 
discreet italian police describe it in a manner typically continental . 
`` there had be a threesome at the party in the suite 's bedroom : miss_harrington ( this be diane 's choice for a roman name ) , another woman who has figure in other very interesting events and one of your well-known american actors . 
`` the actor had have much to drink and apparently become very violent . 
the hotel staff , as_well as residents of the excelsior , tell us they see that both ladies were bleed from scratches as they were see flee down the hall . 
`` they were wear nothing but their scratches . 
they were ask to leave the hotel . 
no charges were file '' . 
the girls , after dress , be indignant . 
`` you can n't do this to us '' , diane scream . 
`` we be americans '' . 
in the morning she find rooms directly across from the excelsior at the equally luxurious hotel_ambassador . 
with the ambassador as headquarters , she continue to promote good_will abroad . 
of_course , her benevolence was limit to those who could afford it , but then there be a limit to what one person can do . 
by this time diane be a beguiling lass of 19 and still seek her place in the world . 
she think royal status might come her way when , while she be still in rome , she meet pulley_bey , a personal procurer to king_farouk of egypt . 
a close friend of hers in the roman days describe it this way : 
`` it be a strange relationship . 
pulley_bey speak no english . 
diane speak no italian or french . 
she have a hard_time make him understand that it be farouk she wish to meet . 
`` pulley_bey insist that she bestow her favors on him '' , the friend continue . 
it seem as though she were always audition . 
no believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors , the plump pulley break the language_barrier and lure her to cairo where she wait for nine months , vainly hope to see farouk . 
pulley had set_up her up at the semiramis_hotel , but she grow impatient wait for a royal reception and move to a luxurious apartment to_which the royal pimp have no key . 
she pick her own middle-eastern friends from the flock of ardent egyptians that buzz around her . 
tewfik_badrawi , mohammed_gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of cairo society enjoy her company . 
`` so extensive become her circle of admirers '' , egyptian police say , `` that her escapades cause distrust '' . 
the roof be about ready to fall_in on diane 's little world , but it take nothing less_than the egyptian revolution to bring it down . 
when farouk was overthrow , police pick_up his personal pimp , pulley_bey . 
they also call_upon diane with a request for a look at her passport . 
the cagey pulley_bey , who speak no english , had take the passport so_that diane could n't leave the country without his approval . 
officials provide a temporary passport , good only for return to the united_states . 
and return to the united_states she did , into waiting arms - the unromantic ones of the new_york district_attorney 's office . 
hold as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of mickey_jelke , the comely courtesan be unable to raise bail and was commit to the women 's house of detention , a terribly overcrowded prison . 
it be a tribute to her talents that she be able to talk_into the district_attorney into have her remove from the prison to a hotel_room , with her meals take at vesuvio 's , an excellent italian restaurant . 
newspapers at_the_time note that the move indicate that she was cooperate with the district_attorney . 
with the end of the trial diane disappear from new_york . 
it be no_longer fashionable to be see with fabulous `` lady_harrington '' . 
several years ago she marry a houston business man , robert_graham . 
she later divorce graham , who is believe to have move to bolivia . 
houston police get to know diane two years ago when the vice_squad pick_up her up for question about a call_girl ring . 
last may , they say , she admit be a prostitute . 
the next time the police see her she be dead . 
it be september 20 , 1960 , in a lavishly decorated apartment littered with liquor bottles . 
she had have a party with a regular visitor , dr._william_w._mcclellan . 
mcclellan , who had once lose his medical license temporarily on a charge of drug_addiction , be with her when she die . 
he had be in the apartment two days and be hazy about what had happen during that time . 
when he realize she be dead , he call two lawyers and_then the police . 
when the police arrive , they find mcclellan and the two lawyers sit and stare silently . 
the blonde 's nude body be in_bed , a green sheet and a pink blanket cover her . 
pictures of her in more glamorous days be on the walls . 
an autopsy disclose a large amount of morphine in diane 's body . 
police theorize that a combination of dope , drink and drugs kill her . 
`` i think that maybe she want it this way '' , a vice_squad cop say . 
`` a maid tell us that she still brag about get $ 50 a date . 
she be on the junk , and they slide fast when that happen . 
at_least she never know what the bottom be like '' . 
i be a carpet salesman . 
i work for one of the biggest chains of retail carpet houses in the east . 
we cater mostly to nice people in the $ 5 - 8000 annual income_bracket and we run a string of snazzy , neon-lit , chromium-plated suburban stores . 
i am sell the stuff of_which is make one of the great american_dreams - wall-to-wall carpeting . 
there be only one trouble with this big , beautiful dream . 
from_where i sit it look more like a nightmare . 
people come to me with_confidence . 
they depend_on my supposedly expert knowledge of a trade of_which they themselves know little . 
but i knowingly abuse their confidence . 
ten-year-old_richard_stewart had be irritable and quarrelsome for almost a year . 
his grades had go steadily downhill , and he had stop bring friends and classmates home from school . 
mr. and mrs._stewart be puzzled and concerned . 
then one_day dick 's classmate jimmy , from next_door , let_the_cat_out_of_the_bag . 
the youngsters in the boys ' class had nickname dick `` bugs_bunny '' because his teeth protrude . 
when richard 's parents tell him they want to take him to an orthodontist - a dentist who specialize in realign teeth and jaws - their young son be interested . 
during the year that follow , dick cooperate whole-heartedly with the dentist and be delighted with the final result achieve - an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely change his facial appearance . 
richard_stewart be no special case . 
`` the majority of children in the united_states could benefit by some form of orthodontic treatment '' , say dr._allan_g._brodie , professor and head of the department of orthodontics at the university of illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field . 
what do parents need_to know about those `` years of the braces '' in_order not to waste a child 's time and their money ? 
how can they tell whether a child need orthodontic treatment ? 
why and when should tooth-straightening be undertake ? 
what be it likely to cost ? 
occlusion be the dentist 's expression for the way teeth fit together when the jaws be closed . 
malocclusion , or a bad fit , be what parents need_to look_out for . 
one main type of malocclusion is characterize by a receding chin and protruding upper front_teeth . 
a chin too prominent in_relation_to the rest of the face , a thrust forward of the lower front_teeth , an overdeveloped lower jawbone , and an underdeveloped upper_jaw indicate the opposite type of malocclusion . 
these two basic malformations have , of_course , many variations . 
a child probably require some form of treatment if he have any of the following conditions : 
a noticeable protrusion of the upper or lower_jaw . 
crooked , overlapping , twisted , or widely_spaced teeth . 
front_teeth not meet when the back_teeth close . 
upper teeth completely cover the lowers when the back_teeth close . 
the eyeteeth ( third from the middle on top , count each front_tooth as the first ) begin to protrude like fangs . 
second teeth that have come_in before the first ones have fall out , make a double row . 
contrary to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago , when all malocclusion was blame on some unfortunate habit , recent studies show that most tooth irregularity have at_least its beginning in hereditary predisposition . 
however , this does not mean that a child 's teeth or jaws must necessarily resemble those of someone in his family . 
tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb - or finger-sucking , tongue-thrusting , or lip-sucking - but it be important to remember that there 's a difference between normal and excessive sucking habits . 
it 's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs , and no mother need worry if a child continue this habit until he be two or three years old . 
occasional sucking up to the fifth year may_not affect a youngster 's teeth ; but after_that , if thumb-sucking pressure be frequent , it will have an effect . 
malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lose too_soon or retain too long . 
if a child lose a molar at the age of two , the adjoining teeth may shift toward the empty space , thus narrow the place intended for the permanent ones and produce a jumble . 
if baby teeth are retain too long , the incoming second teeth may be prevent from emerge at the normal time or may have_to erupt in the wrong place . 
every orthodontist see children who are embarrass by their malformed teeth . 
some such youngsters rarely smile , or they try to speak with the mouth closed . 
in certain cases , as in dick_stewart 's , a child 's personality is affect . 
yet from the dentist 's point_of_view , bad-fitting teeth should be correct for physical reasons . 
bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through a breakdown of the bony structure that support their roots . 
this serious condition , popularly known as pyorrhea , be one of the chief causes of tooth loss in adults . 
then , too , misplaced or jammed-together teeth be prone to trap food particles , increase the likelihood of rapid decay . 
`` for these and other reasons '' , say dr._brodie , `` orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth '' . 
the failure of teeth to fit together when closed interfere with normal chewing , so_that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden on his digestive_system . 
because of these chewing troubles , a child may avoid certain foods he need for adequate nutrition . 
badly placed teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping . 
`` most orthodontic work is do on children between the ages of 10 and 14 , though there have be patients as young as two and as old as 55 '' , say dr._brodie . 
in the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth be usually completed , yet the continuing growth of bony tissue make moving badly placed teeth comparatively easy . 
orthodontic work be possible because teeth are hold firmly but not rigidly , by a system of peridontal membrane with an involved nerve network , to the bone in the jaw ; they are not anchor directly to the bone . 
abnormal pressure , apply over a period_of_time , produce a change in the bony deposit , so a tooth function normally in the new position into which it has been guide . 
what can 10 - year-old susan expect when she enter the orthodontist 's office ? 
on her first visit the orthodontist will take x-rays , photographs , tooth measurements , and `` tooth prints '' - an impression of the mouth that permit him to study her teeth and jaws . 
if he decide to proceed , he will custom-make for susie an appliance consist_of bands , plastic plates , fine wires , and tiny springs . 
this appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure on the bone . 
as the tooth move , bone_cells on the pressure side of_it will dissolve , and new ones will form on_the_side from which the tooth has move . 
this must be do at the rate at which new bony tissue grow , and no faster . 
`` if teeth are move too rapidly , serious injury can be done to their roots as_well as to the surrounding bone hold them in_place '' , explain dr._brodie . 
`` move one or two teeth can affect the whole system , and an ill-conceived plan of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child 's face '' . 
during the first few days of wear the appliance and immediately following each adjustment , susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness , but after a short_time this will disappear . 
parents are often concern that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay . 
when in_place , a well-cemented band actually protect the part of the tooth that be covered . 
next susie will enter the treatment stage and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month , depending_on the severity of her condition . 
during these visits the dentist will adjust the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth . 
last come the retention stage . 
susie 's teeth have now been guide into a desirable new position . 
but because teeth sometimes may drift back to their original position , a retaining appliance is use to lock them in_place . 
usually this be a thin band of wire attach to the molars and stretching across the teeth . 
susie may wear this only at night or for a_few hours during the day . 
then come the time when the last wire is remove and susie walk out a healthier and more attractive girl than when she first go to the orthodontist . 
how long will this take ? 
straighten one tooth that has come_in wrong may take only a_few months . 
align all the teeth may take a year or more . 
an added complication such_as a malformed jaw may take two or three years to correct . 
the charge for a complete full-banded job differ in various parts of the country . 
work that might cost $ 500 to $ 750 in the south could cost $ 750 to $ 1200 in new_york_city or chicago . 
an average national figure for two to three years of treatment would be $ 650 to $ 1000 . 
`` factors in the cost of treatment be the length of time involved and the skill and education of the practitioner '' , say dr._brodie . 
to become an orthodontist , a man must first be license by his state as a dentist , then he must spend at_least two years in additional training to acquire a license as a specialist . 
`` costs may seem high , but they used_to be even higher '' , say dr._brodie . 
`` fees be about half to a third of_what they be 25 years ago '' . 
the reason ? 
people today be aware_of the value of orthodontics , and as a result there be more practitioners in the field . 
most orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic materials and construction of the appliances , but usually the remainder of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years . 
in many cities in the united_states clinics associated with dental_schools will take patients at a nominal fee . 
some municipal agencies will pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents . 
growth studies have been carry_on consistently by orthodontists . 
dr._brodie have 30 - year records of head growth , start 20 minutes after children 's births . 
`` in_the_past anyone who say that 90  of all malocclusion be hereditary was scoff at ; now we know that family characteristics do affect tooth formation to a large extent '' , he say . 
`` fortunately through our growth studies we have be able to see what nature do , and that help us know what we can do '' . 
this knowledge both modify and dictate diagnosis and treatment . 
for_example , a boy may inherit a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another . 
in_the_past an orthodontist might have try , over four or five years , to straighten and fit the boy 's large teeth into a jaw that , despite some growth , would never accommodate them . 
now a dentist can recommend extraction immediately . 
in other cases , in_view of present-day knowledge of head growth , orthodontists will recommend wait four or five years before treatment . 
the child is keep on call , and the orthodontist watch the growth . 
`` nature often take care in the problem '' , say dr._brodie . 
`` a child with a certain type of head and teeth will outgrow tooth deformity '' . 
that be why dr._brodie ask parents not to insist , against their dentist 's advice , that their child have orthodontic work do too early . 
`` both because of our culture 's stress on beauty and our improved economic_conditions , some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it be wise_to do so . 
let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start treatment '' , he urge . 
superior new material for orthodontic work be another result of research . 
plastics be easier to handle than the vulcanized rubber formerly use , and they save time and money . 
plaster_of_paris , once utilize in making impressions of teeth , has been replace by alginates ( gelatin-like material ) that work quickly and accurately and with least discomfort to a child . 
as a rule , the earlier general dental treatment is start , the less expensive and more satisfactory it be likely to be . 
`` after your child 's baby teeth be all_in - usually at the age of two and one half to three - it 's time for that first dental appointment '' , dr._brodie advise . 
`` then see that your youngster have a routine checkup once a year '' . 
to help prevent orthodontic problems from arise , your dentist can do these things : 
he can correct decay , thus prevent early loss of teeth . 
if a child does lose his first teeth prematurely because of decay - and if no preventive steps are take - the other teeth may shift out of position , become overcrowded and malformed . 
in_turn the other teeth be likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them . 
from_time_to_time the medium mention other people `` around him '' , who be `` on the other side '' , and report what they are say . 
after a while there come initials and names , and he be interested to hear some rather unusual family nicknames . 
as the hour progress , the sensitive seem to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific statements . 
there be a_few prognoses of coming events . 
another medium , another sitter , would produce a somewhat different content , but in_general it would probably sound much like the foregoing reading . 
some mediums speak in practical , down-to-earth terms , while others may stress the spiritual . 
not all , as_a_matter_of_fact , consider themselves `` mediums '' in the sense of receive messages from the deceased . 
in_fact , some sensitives rule_out this out , prefer to consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception ( esp ) , on this side of the `` veil '' . 
however that may be , people be known to go_to mediums for diverse reasons . 
perhaps they are mourn a recent death and want comfort , to feel in touch with the deceased , or seek indications for future plans . 
they may , of_course , be curiosity seekers - or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship . 
the mediums with whom the parapsychology_foundation is work in_this experiment be in a waking or only slightly dissociated state , so_that the sitter can make comments , ask and answer questions , instead of talk with a `` control '' who speak through an entranced sensitive . 
what we have here be in some ways more like an ordinary conversation . 
but it be not really only a conversation . 
many_a sitter ( in a personal sitting ) has been amaze to realize that the medium was describe very vividly his state_of_mind . 
he himself might_not have be really aware_of his own mood ; it had be latent , unspecified , semi-conscious and only partly realized - until she describe it to him ! 
most striking indeed be this beyond-normal ability to put_a_finger_on `` pre-conscious '' moods and to clarify them . 
however , in the next visit that the researcher make to the medium , he did not receive a personal reading . 
instead he bring with him the names of some people he had never meet and of whom the medium know nothing . 
for this be to be a `` proxy sitting '' . 
as was note earlier , it be important that in valid , objective study of_this sort_of communication , the interested sitter should be separate from the sensitive . 
dr._karlis_osis , director_of_research at the parapsychology_foundation , describe the basis for the experiment in a tomorrow article , ( `` new_research on survival after death '' , spring 1958 ) . 
he remark : `` it has been clearly establish that in a_number_of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was receive telepathically by the medium from the sitter '' . 
the possibility has_to be rule_out that the medium 's esp may tap the memory of the sitter , and to do this , the two central characters in_this drama must be separate . 
one way to do this be by `` proxy sittings '' , wherein the person seek a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represent by a substitute , the proxy sitter . 
if the latter know nothing about the absent sitter except his name ( give by the experimenter ) , he cannot possibly give any clues , conscious or unconscious , far less ask leading questions . 
all he can do be to be an objective and careful questioner , seek to help the sensitive in clarify and make more specific her paranormal impressions . 
sometimes in these experiments `` appointment sittings '' are use . 
here the absent sitter makes a `` date '' with a communicator ( someone close_to him who be deceased ) , ask him to `` come_in '' at a certain hour , when a channel will be open for him . 
in_this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator , nothing else . 
he give this to the medium at the appointed time , and the reading then will be concern with material about or messages from the communicator . 
as always , a tape_recording or detailed notes are make , and a typescript of_this is send to the absent sitter . 
so this proxy situation has set_up at_least a partial barrier between the medium 's esp and the absent sitter 's mind . 
it be now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements - though research still does not know how far afield esp can range . 
now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statements be meaningful to him . 
here again laboratory approaches are being evolve , for it is recognize how `` elastic '' these readings can be , how they can apply to many people , and are often state in_general terms all_too easily apply to any individual 's own case . 
if you look_at a reading meant for someone else , you will probably see that many_of the items could be consider as applicable to you , even when you be not in the picture at_all ! 
an interested sitter may think the sensitive has make a `` hit '' , describe something accurately for him , but can he really be sure that another sitter , hear the same statement , would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances ? 
it be , of_course , easy to see how `` j '' will mean uncle_jack to one person and little jane to another . 
`` a journey '' , `` a_little white_house '' , `` a change of outlook '' , can apply to many people . 
and even more complex items can be interpret to conform_to one 's own point_of_view , which be by nature so personal . 
one sitter may think `` a leather couch '' identify a reading as surely direct to him ; to another , it seem that nobody but his father ever use the phrase , `` atta boy '' ! 
to get_around this quite difficult corner , there be one first_aid to objectiveness : prevent the distant sitter from know which reading be for him . 
if he is not tell which of four or five readings was meant for him , he can more readily assess each item in a larger frame : `` does that statement really sound as if it be for me , significant in my particular life ? 
or am i take something that could really apply to almost anybody , and forget that many other people probably have have a similar experience '' ? 
conversely , experimenters would consider as impressive such statements as the following , which , if they turn_out to be hits , be so unusual as to be really significant : 
`` he have four children , two sets of twins . 
after be a lawyer for twenty-five years he start study for the ministry . 
part of his house had been move to the other side of the road . 
he die of typhoid in 1921 '' . 
methods have been develop of assign `` weights '' to statements ; that_is , it is know empirically that names begin with r be more common than those begin with z ; that fewer women be named miranda than elizabeth ; that in the united_states more people die of heart_disease than of smallpox . 
so each reading can be give a weight and each reading a score by add_up these weights . 
specific dates would be important , as would double names . 
various categories have been explore to find_out about these `` empirical probabilities '' against which to measure the readings . 
in the parapsychology_foundation 's long-range experiment , readings are make by a variety of sensitives for a large_number of cooperating sitters , try to throw light on this question of the significance of mediumistic statements . 
it be very important indeed , in the field of extra-sensory perception and its relation_to the survival hypothesis , to know whether the statements be actually only those which any intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself . 
or , on_the_other_hand , are unlikely facts being state , facts which be in themselves significant and not easily applicable to everybody ? 
that be one thing the experiments are design to find_out . 
so , after the sitting has been hold , several readings at_one_time are mail , and the distant sitter ( whose name or whose communicator 's name was give to the medium ) must mark each little item as correct ( hit ) , incorrect ( miss ) , doubtful , or especially significant ( apply to him and , he feel , not to anyone else ) . 
he is require to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feel be actually his . 
all these evaluations are then tot_up and tabulate , by add_up the hits and significants , with the weight place on those in the sitter 's own reading . 
that_is , if he mark as most correct a reading not meant for him , the total experimental score fall . 
conversely , if he give a heavy rating to his own reading , and find more accurate facts in it than in the others , a point is chalk_up for the intrinsic , objective meaningfulness of_this type of mediumistic material . 
and there be some positive results , though the final findings will not be know for a long_time - and_then further research can be formulate . 
in another approach to the same procedure , the content of the readings is analyze so_as_to see how the particular medium be likely to slant her statements . 
does she often speak of locations , of cause of death ? 
does she accurately give dates , ages , kind_of occupation ? 
it be possible to find_out in_which categories most_of her correct statements fall , and where she make most_of her `` hits '' . 
now when , so_to_speak , the cream has been skim_off , and the items in the successful categories separate_out , the sitter can be ask to consider and rate only this concentrated `` cream '' , where the sensitive be at her best . 
mediumistic impressions be evidently of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses . 
`` i feel cold '' , the medium say , or `` my leg ache '' , `` my head be heavy '' . 
or perhaps she hear words or sounds : `` there 's such a noise of loud machinery '' , or `` i hear a child cry '' , or `` he say we be all here and glad to see you '' . 
maybe an entire scene come into consciousness , with action and motion , or a static view : `` a house under a pine_tree , with a_little stone path go up to the door '' . 
the sensitive often seem to smell definite odors , too , or subjectively feel emotions . 
sometimes she display amazing eidetic imagery and seem to see all details in perspective , as if the scene be actually there . 
if press by the sitter for more detail , she may be able to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply , almost as if she were physically go closer . 
if ask how she get her impressions , she probably can only say that she `` just get them '' - some more vividly than others . 
perhaps this be not so extraordinary after_all . 
even in normal experience one get impressions without know exactly how - of atmosphere , of one another 's personalities , moods , intentions . 
of_course , there be an element of training here : 
these gifted people , by concentration , study , guidance , have learn to develop their power . 
simply use it increase its intensity , i was tell by one sensitive . 
nor does a medium automatically know how to interpret her imagery . 
impressions often appear in a symbolic form and cannot be take at face_value . 
it be apparently by symbols that the unconscious speak_to the conscious , and the medium has_to translate these into meaning . 
if communication with an entity on the `` other side '' is take_place , this too may assume the form of clairvoyant symbolism . 
during one reading an image appear of a prisoner in irons . 
but this did not necessarily refer to an actual jail ; take with other details it could have refer to a state of mental or spiritual confinement . 
in_this connection it be worth note how names are sometimes obtain . 
though they are often hear clairaudiently , as if a voice were speak them , in other cases they are apprehend visually as symbols : a slope to signify the name `` hill '' , for_instance . 
one medium see two sheets flap on a line and find that the name shietz be significant to the sitter . 
in_the_past , the duties of the state , as sir_henry_maine note long_ago , be only two in number : internal order and external security . 
by prevail over other claimants for the loyalties of men , the nation-state maintain an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial borders . 
outside those limits it assert , as against other states , a position of sovereign equality , and , as against the `` inferior '' peoples of the non-western world , a position of dominance . 
it become the sole `` subject '' of `` international_law '' ( a term which , it be pertinent to remember , was coin by bentham ) , a body of legal_principle which by_and_large was make_up of what western nations could do in the world arena . 
( that corpus of law be a reflection of the power_system in existence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . 
speak generally , it further - and still tend to further - the interests of the western powers . 
the enormous changes in world politics have , however , throw it into confusion , so_much so_that it be safe to say that all international_law be now in need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions of the present era . ) 
beyond the two basic tasks mention above , no attention was pay_attention by statesman or scholar to an idea of state responsibility , either internally or externally . 
this be particularly true in the world arena , which be an anarchical battleground characterize by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires . 
that any sort_of duty was owe by his nation to other nations would have astonish a nineteenth-century statesman . 
his duty be to his sovereign and to his nation , and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial boundaries was not to be contemplate . 
thus , to cite but one example , the pax_britannica of the nineteenth century , whether with the_british navy rule the seas or with the city of london rule world finance , be strictly national in motivation , however much other nations ( e._g. , the united_states ) may have incidentally benefit . 
at_the_same_time , all suggestions that some sort_of societal responsibility exist for the welfare of the people within the territorial state was strongly resist . 
social_darwinism be able to stave_off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century . 
however , in recent decades , for what doubtless be multiple reasons , an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has occur in both facets of national activity . 
a concept of responsibility be in process of articulation and establishment . 
already firmly implant internally , it be a growing factor in external matters . 
a_little more_than twenty years ago the american people turn an important corner . 
in_what has aptly be call a `` constitutional revolution '' , the basic nature of government was transform from one essentially negative in nature ( the `` night-watchman state '' ) to one with affirmative duties to perform . 
the `` positive state '' come into existence . 
for lawyers , reflect perhaps their parochial preferences , there has be a special fascination since then in the role play by the supreme_court in_that transformation - the manner in_which its decisions alter in `` the switch in_time that save nine '' , president_roosevelt 's ill-starred but in_effect victorious `` court-packing plan '' , the imprimatur of judicial approval that was finally place upon social legislation . 
of greater importance , however , be the content of those programs , which have have and are have enormous consequences for the american people . 
labor relations have been transform , income security has become a standardized feature of political_platforms , and all the many facets of the american version of the welfare_state have become part of the conventional wisdom . 
a national consensus of near unanimity exist that these governmental efforts be desirable as_well as necessary . 
ratify in the republican_party victory in 1952 , the positive state is now evidence by political_campaigns being wage not on whether but on how much social legislation there should be . 
the general acceptance of the idea of governmental ( i. e. , societal ) responsibility for the economic well-being of the american people be surely one of the two most significant watersheds in american constitutional history . 
the other , of_course , be the civil_war , the conflict which a century ago insure national unity over fragmentation . 
a third , one of at_least equal and perhaps even greater importance , is now being traverse : american immersion and involvement in world affairs . 
internal national responsibility , now a truism , need not be document . 
nevertheless , it may be helpful to cite one example - that of employment - for , as will be show below , it cut_across both facets of the new concept . 
thirty years ago , while the nation was wallow in economic depression , the prevailing philosophy of government be to stand aside and allow `` natural forces '' to operate and cure the distress . 
that guiding principle of the hoover_administration fall to the siege guns of the new_deal ; less_than a score of years later congress enact the employment_act of 1946 , by which the national government assume the responsibility of take action to insure conditions of maximum employment . 
hands-off the economy was replace by conscious guidance through planning - the economic side of the constitutional revolution . 
in 1961 the first important legislative victory of the kennedy_administration come when the principle of national responsibility for local economic distress win out over a `` state 's - responsibility '' proposal - provision was make for payment for unemployment relief by nation-wide taxation rather_than by a levy only on those states afflicted with manpower surplus . 
the american people have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961 . 
internal national responsibility be a societal response to the impact of the industrial_revolution . 
reduce to its simplest terms , it be an assumption of a collective duty to compensate in the inability of individuals to cope_with the rigors of the era . 
national responsibility for individual welfare be a concept not limit to the united_states or even to the western nations . 
a measure of its widespread acceptance may be derive from a statement of the international_congress of jurists in 1959 . 
meet in new_delhi under the auspices of the international_commission of jurists , a body of lawyers from the free_world , the congress redefine and expand the traditional rule_of_law to include affirmative governmental duties . 
it be noteworthy that the majority of the delegates to the congress be from the less developed , former colonial nations . 
the rule_of_law , historically a principle accord everyone his `` day in court '' before an impartial tribunal , was broaden substantively by make it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare . 
recognize that the rule_of_law be `` a dynamic concept which should be employ not_only to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society '' , the congress assert that it also include the responsibility `` to establish social , economic , educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realize '' . 
the idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the non-soviet world . 
for better or for worse , we all now live in welfare_states , the organizing principle of_which be collective responsibility for individual well-being . 
whether a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility operate in a nation 's external relations be less obvious and more difficult to establish . 
the hypothesis venture here be that it does , and that evidence is accumulate validate that proposition . 
the content be not the same , however : rather_than individual security , it be the security and continuing existence of an `` ideological group '' - those in the `` free_world '' - that be basic . 
external national responsibility involve a burgeon requirement that the leaders of the western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability of other friendly nations . 
if internal responsibility suggest acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality , then external responsibility imply adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism . 
reference_to two other concepts - nationalism and sovereignty - may help to reveal the contours of the new principle . 
in its beginnings the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself - internally , against feudal groups , and externally , against the power and influence of such other claimants for loyalty as the church . 
the breakup of the holy_roman_empire and the downfall of feudalism lead , not more_than two centuries ago , to the surge of nationalism . 
( since the time-span of the nation-state coincide roughly with the separate existence of the united_states as an independent entity , it be perhaps natural for americans to think_of the nation as representative of the highest form of order , something permanent and unchanging . ) 
the concept of nationalism be the political principle that epitomize and glorify the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure . 
but it be more_than that . 
for it include the emotional ties that bind men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large group of people together as a unit . 
today , as new nations rise from the former colonial empires , nationalism be one of the hurricane forces loose in the world . 
almost febrile in intensity , the principle has become worldwide in application - unfortunately at the very time that nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm . 
historically , however , the concept be one that has be of marked benefit to the people of the western civilizational group . 
by subdue disparate lesser groups the nation has , to_some_degree at_least , broaden the capacity for individual liberty . 
within their confines , moreover , technological and industrial growth has proceed at an accelerated pace , thus increase the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfy . 
while the pattern be uneven , some having gain more_than others , nationalism has in_fact serve the western peoples well . 
( whether historical nationalism help the peoples of the remainder of the world , and whether today 's nationalism in the former colonial areas have equally beneficial aspects , be other questions . ) 
it be one of the ironic quirks of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the territorial state are rapidly dissipate at precisely the time that the nation-state attain its highest number ( approximately 100 ) . 
but it be more_than irony : one of the main reasons why nationalism be no_longer a tenable concept be because it has spread throughout the planet . 
in_other_words , nationalism work well enough when it have limited application , both as to geography and as to population ; it become a perilous anachronism when adopt on a world-wide basis . 
complement the political principle of nationalism be the legal_principle of sovereignty . 
the former receive its legitimacy from the latter . 
operate side_by_side , together they help shore_up the nation-state . 
while sovereignty have roots in antiquity , in its present usage it be essentially modern . 
jean_bodin , write in the sixteenth century , may have be the seminal thinker , but it be the vastly influential john_austin who set_out the main_lines of the concept as now understand . 
austin 's nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty still dominate much of today 's legal and political thinking . 
to him , law be the command of the sovereign ( the_english monarch ) who personify the power of the nation , while sovereignty be the power to make law - i. e. , to prevail over internal groups and to be free from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations . 
these fundamental ideas - the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual ( internal-external ) aspects - still remain the core of_that concept of ultimate political power . 
the nation-state , then , exemplify the principle of nationalism and exercise sovereignty : supreme power over domestic affairs and independence from outside control . 
in_fact , however , both principles have always be nebulous and loosely defined . 
high-level abstractions be always difficult to pin_down with precision . 
that be particularly true of sovereignty when it is apply to democratic societies , in_which `` popular '' sovereignty is say to exist , and in federal nations , in_which the jobs of government be split . 
nevertheless , nationalism and sovereignty are repute , in the accepted wisdom , to describe the modern_world . 
is_there a different reality behind the facade ? 
does the surface hide a quite different picture ? 
the short answer to those questions be `` yes '' . 
both concepts are undergo alteration ; to_some_degree they are being supplant by a concept of national responsibility . 
as evidence to support that view , consider the following illustrative instances . 
can thermonuclear war be set_off by_accident ? 
what steps have been take to guard against the one sort_of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continents ? 
be we as safe as we should be from such a disaster ? 
is anything being do to increase our margin of safety ? 
will the danger increase or decrease ? 
i have just ask these questions in the pentagon , in the white_house , in offices of key scientists across_the_country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater , with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain polaris missiles and which be affectionately known as `` sherwood_forest '' . 
i ask the same questions inside the launch-control rooms of an atlas missile base in wyoming , where officers who wear sidearms are man the `` commit buttons '' that could start a war - accidentally or by_design - and in the command centers where other pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons . 
to the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits , submarine compartments and the antiseptic , windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrow 's impersonal intercontinental wars , the questions seem farfetched . 
there be unceasing pressure , but its sources be immediate . 
`` readiness exercises '' be almost continuous . 
each could be the real_thing . 
in the command centers there be special clocks ready_to tick off the minutes elapse since `` e hour '' . 
`` e '' stand_for `` execution '' - the moment a `` go order '' would unleash an american nuclear strike . 
there be little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks . 
they be preoccupied ride_herd_on control_panels , switches , flashing colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look_like business machines . 
they know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details . 
accidental war be so sensitive a subject that most_of the people who could become directly involved in one are tell just enough so they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks . 
among the policy makers , generals , physicists , psychologists and_others charge with control the actions of the button pushers and their `` hardware '' , the answers to my questions vary partly according to_a_man 's flair for what the professionals in_this field call `` scenarios '' . 
as an air_force psychiatrist put it : `` you can n't have dry_runs on this one '' . 
the experts are thus force to hypothesize sequences of events that have never occur , probably never will - but possibly might . 
only one rule prevail in my conversations with these men : the more highly placed they be - that_is , the more they know - the more concerned they have become . 
already accidental war be a silent guest at the discussions within the kennedy_administration about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions of national security . 
only recently new `` holes '' were discover in our safety measures , and a search be now on for more . 
work be under_way to see whether new restraining devices should be_installed on all nuclear_weapons . 
meanwhile , the experts speak of wars trigger by `` false pre-emption '' , `` escalation '' , `` unauthorized behavior '' and other terms that will be discuss in_this report . 
they inhabit a secret world center on `` go codes '' and `` gold phones '' . 
their conversations were , almost invariably , accompany by the same gestures - arms and pointed forefingers dart toward each other in arclike semicircular motions . 
one arm represent our bombers and missiles , the other arm `` theirs '' . 
yet implicit_in each movement be the death of millions , perhaps hundreds of millions , perhaps you and me - and the experts . 
these men be not callous . 
it be their job to think_about the unthinkable . 
unanimously they believe that the world would become a safer place if more of us - and more russians and communist chinese , too - think_about accidental war . 
the first systematic thinking about this pandora 's box within pandora 's boxes was do four years ago by fred_ikle , a frail , meek-mannered swiss-born sociologist . 
he be , and be , with the rand_corporation , a nonprofit pool of thinkers finance by the u._s. air_force . 
his investigations make him the paul_revere of accidental war , and safety procedures were enormously increase . 
in recent weeks , as a result of a sweeping defense_policy reappraisal by the kennedy_administration , basic united_states strategy has been modify - and large new sums allocate - to meet the accidental-war danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible . 
the chain start at bmews ( ballistic_missile early_warning_system ) in thule , greenland . 
its radar screens would register soviet missiles shortly after they are launch against the united_states . 
bmews intelligence is simultaneously flash to norad ( north_american air_defense command ) in colorado_springs , colorado , for interpretation ; to the sac command and control post , forty-five feet below the ground at offutt air_force base , near omaha , nebraska ; to the joint_war_room of the joint chiefs_of_staff in the pentagon and to the president . 
telephones , teletypes , several kinds of radio systems and , in some cases , television , link all vital points . 
alternate locations exist for all key command centers . 
for last-ditch emergencies sac have alternate command_posts on kc-135 jet tankers . 
multiple circuits , routings and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible . 
the same principle of `` redundancy '' apply to all communications on these special networks . 
and no messages can be transmit on these circuits until senders and receivers authenticate in_advance , by special codes , that the messages actually come from their purported sources . 
additional codes can be use to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications . 
only the president is permit to authorize the use of nuclear_weapons . 
that 's the law . 
but what if somebody decide to break it ? 
the president cannot personally remove the safety devices from every nuclear trigger . 
he make the momentous decision . 
hundreds of men are require to pass the word to the button pushers and to push the buttons . 
what if one or more of them turn irrational or suddenly , coolly , decide to clobber the russians ? 
what if the president himself , in the language of the military , `` goes_ape '' ? 
or singlehandedly decide to reverse national policy and hit the soviets without provocation ? 
nobody can be absolutely certain of the answers . 
however , the system is design , ingeniously and hopefully , so_that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war . 
even the president cannot pick_up his telephone and give a `` go '' order . 
even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike - the `` go code '' . 
in an emergency he would receive available intelligence on the `` gold-phone circuit '' . 
a system of `` gold '' - actually yellow - phones connect him with the offices and action stations of the secretary of defense , the joint chiefs_of_staff , the sac commander and other key men . 
all can be_connected with the gold circuit from their homes . 
all could help the president make his decision . 
the talk would not be in code , but neither would it ramble . 
vital questions would be quickly answer according to a preprepared agenda . 
officers who participate in the continual practice drills assure me that the president 's decision could be made and announce on the gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from bmews . 
if communications work , his decision would be instantly know in_all command_posts that would originate the actual go order . 
for these centers , too , be on the gold circuit . 
they include the navy 's atlantic_command at norfolk , virginia , which be in_contact with the polaris subs ; nato headquarters in europe ; air_force forward headquarters in europe and in the pacific , which control tactical fighters on ships and land bases ; and sac , which control long-range bombers and atlas missiles . 
let us look in on one of these nerve_centers - sac at omaha - and see what must still happen before a wing of b-52 bombers could drop their h-bombs . 
in a word , plenty . 
the key man almost certainly would be col._william_w._wisman , sac 's senior controller . 
he or his deputy or one of their seven assistants , all full colonels , man the heart of the command_post twenty-four_hours a day . 
it be a quiet but impressive room - 140 feet long , thirty-nine feet wide , twenty-one feet high . 
movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts be crammed with intelligence information . 
and bill_wisman , forty-three , a farmer 's son from beallsville , ohio , be a quiet but impressive man . 
his eyes be steady anchors of the deepest brown . 
his movements and speech be precise , clear and quick . 
no question ruffle him or cause him to hesitate . 
wisman , who has have the chief controller 's job for four years , call the signals for a team operate three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights , switches and buttons . 
at_least a dozen men , some armed , be never far away from him . 
in_front of him be a gold phone . 
in emergencies the sac commander , gen._thomas_power , or his deputies and their staff would occupy a balcony that stretch across the length of the room above wisman and his staff . 
at general_power 's seat in the balcony there be also a gold phone . 
general_power would participate in the decision_making . 
wisman , below , would listen_in and act . 
his consoles can give him instant contact with more_than seventy bases around the world and with every sac aircraft . 
he need only pick_up one of the two red telephone_receivers at his extreme left , right next to the big red button marked `` alert '' . 
( there be two receivers in_case one should be drop and damage . ) 
but wisman , too , does not know the go code . 
he must take it from `` the red box '' . 
in_point_of_fact , this be a beige box with a bright red door , about one and a half feet square and hang from the wall about six feet from the door to wisman 's right . 
the box is internally wire so the door can never be open without set_off a screeching klaxon ( `` it 's real obnoxious '' ) . 
now we must become vague , for we are approach one of the nation 's most guarded secrets . 
the codes in the red box - there be several of them cover various contingencies - are contain in a sealed x-ray-proof `` unique device '' . 
they are supply , a batch at_a_time , by a secret source and are continually change by wisman or his staff , at_random intervals . 
but even the contents of wisman 's box cannot start a war . 
they be mere fragments , just one portion of preprepared messages . 
what these fragments be and_how they activate the go order may_not be_revealed . 
the pieces must be place in the context of the prepared messages by wisman 's staff . 
in_addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures which precede and follow the sending of the go messages , again in special codes , each message also contain an `` internal authenticator '' , another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is get the real_thing . 
i ask wisman what would happen if he break_out the go codes and try to start transmit one . 
`` i 'd wind_up full_of .38 bullet_holes '' , he say , and there be no question that he was talk_about bullets fire by his coworkers . 
now let us imagine a wing of b-52 's , on alert near their `` positive control ( or fail-safe ) points '' , the spots on the map , many miles from soviet territory , beyond which they are forbid to fly without specific orders to proceed to their targets . 
they , too , have fragments of the go code with them . 
as wisman put it , `` they have separate pieces of the pie , and we have the whole pie . 
once we send_out the whole pie , they can put their pieces into it . 
unless we send_out the whole pie , their pieces mean nothing '' . 
why does wisman 's ever-changing code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers ? 
the answer be a cryptographic secret . 
at_any_rate , three men out of a six-man b-52 crew are require to copy down wisman 's go-to-war message . 
each must match wisman 's `` pie '' with the fragment that he carry with him . 
all three must compare notes and agree to `` go '' . 
after_that , it require several minutes of concentrated work , include six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum of three men sit at three separate stations in a bomber , each with another man beside him to help , for an armed bomb to be_released . 
unless all gadgets are properly operate - and the wires and seals from the handles remove first - no damage can be do . 
suddenly , however , their posture change and the game end . 
they go as rigid as black statuary - six figures , lean and tall and angular , go still . 
their heads be in_the_air sniff . 
they all swing at the same instant in the same direction . 
they see it before i did , even with my binoculars . 
it be nothing more_than a tiny distant rain squall , a dull gray sheet which reach from a layer of clouds to the earth . 
in the 360 degrees of horizon it obscure only a degree , no_more . 
a white_man would not have see it . 
the aborigines fasten upon it with a concentration beyond pathos . 
watch , they wait until the squall thicken and begin to move in a long drifting slant across the dry burning land . 
at_once the whole band set_off at a lope . 
they were chase a rain_cloud . 
they go_after the squall as mercilessly as a wolf_pack after an abandoned cow . 
i follow them in the jeep and now they did not care . 
the games be over , this be life . 
occasionally , for no reason that i could see , they would suddenly alter the angle of their trot . 
sometimes i guess it was because the rain squall had change direction . 
sometimes it was to skirt a gulley . 
their gait be impossible to convey in words . 
it have nothing of the proud stride of the trained runner about it , it be not a lope , it is not do with style or verve . 
it be the gait of the human who must run to live : arms dangle , legs barely swing over the ground , head hang down and only occasionally swing up_to see the target , a loose motion that be just short of stumble and yet be wonderfully graceful . 
it be a barely controlled skimming of the ground . 
they run for three hours . 
finally , avoid hummocks and seek low ground , they intercept the rain squall . 
for ten minutes they run beneath the squall , raise their arms and , for_the_first_time , shout and caper . 
then the wind die and the rain squall hold steady . 
they were study the ground . 
suddenly one of them shout , run a_few feet , bend forward and put his mouth to the ground . 
he had find a depression with rain water in it . 
he bend down , a black cranelike figure , and put his mouth to the ground . 
with a lordly and generous gesture , the discoverer stand_up and beckon to the closest of his fellows . 
the other trot over and swoop at the tiny puddle . 
in an instant he had suck it dry . 
the aborigine live_on the cruelest land i have ever see . 
which does not mean that it be ugly . 
part of_it be , of_course . 
there be thousands of square_miles of salt pan which be hideous . 
they be huge areas which have been sweep by winds for so many centuries that there be no soil left , but only deep bare ridges fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty feet deep and the only thing that move be a scuttle layer of sand . 
such stretches have an inhuman moonlike quality . 
but much of the land which the aborigine wander look as if it should be hospitable . 
it is soften by the saltbush and the bluebush , have a peaceful quality , the hills roll softly . 
the malignancy of such a landscape has been beautifully describe by the australian charles_bean . 
he tell of three men who start_out on a trip across a single paddock , a ten-by-ten-mile square own by a sheep grazer . 
they go well-equipped with everything except knowledge of the `` outback '' country . 
`` the countryside look_like a beautiful open park with gentle slopes and soft gray tree-clumps . 
nothing appalling or horrible rush upon these men . 
only there happen - nothing . 
there might have be a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps : only - there be not . 
it might have rain , any time ; only - it did not . 
there might have be a fence or a house just over the next rise ; only - there be not . 
they lie , with the_birds hop from branch to branch above them and the bright sky peep down at them . 
no one come '' . 
the white_men die . 
and countless others like them have die . 
even today range riders will come_upon mummified bodies of men who attempt nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly lose direction , were torture by the heat , drive mad by the constant and unfulfilled promise of the landscape , and who finally die . 
the aborigine is not deceive ; he know that the land be hard and pitiless . 
he know that the economy of life in the `` outback '' be awful . 
there be no room for error or waste . 
any organism that falter or misperceive the signals or weaken be done . 
i do not know if such a way_of_life can come to be a self-conscious challenge , but i suspect that it can . 
perhaps this be what give the aborigine his odd air of dignity . 
see an aborigine today be a difficult thing . 
many_of them have drift into the cities and towns and seaports . 
others are confine to vast reservations , and not_only does the australian government justifiably not wish them to be view_as exhibits in a zoo , but on their reservations they be extremely fugitive , shun camps , come together only for corroborees at which their strange culture come to its highest pitch - which be very low indeed . 
i persuade an australian friend who had live `` outback '' for years to take me to see some aborigines live in the bush . 
it be a difficult and ambiguous kind_of negotiation , even_though the rancher was say to be expert in his knowledge of the aborigines and their language . 
finally , however , the arrangements were make and we drive out into the bush in a land_rover . 
we follow the asphalt road for a_few miles and_then swing off onto a smaller road which be nothing more_than two tire marks on the earth . 
the rancher go a mile down this road and_then , when he reach a big red boulder , swing off the road . 
at_once he start to glance toward the instrument_panel . 
it take me a moment to realize what be odd about that panel : there be a gimbaled compass weld to_it , which rock gently back_and_forth as the land_rover bounce about . 
the rancher was navigate his way across the flatland . 
`` do you always navigate like this '' ? 
i ask . 
`` damned right '' , he say . 
`` once i get out on the flat i do . 
some chaps that know an area well can make their way by landmarks - a tree here , a wash here , a boulder there . 
but if you do n't know the place like the palm of your hand , you 'd better use a compass and the speedometer . 
two miles northeast , then five miles southwest - that sort_of thing . 
very simple '' . 
he be right . 
the landscape keep repeat itself . 
i would try to memorize landmarks and see in a half-hour that it be hopeless . 
finally we approach the bivouac of the aborigines . 
they were camp beside a large column-shaped boulder : a man , his lubra , and two children . 
the sun be not_yet high and all_of them be in the small area of shade cast by the boulder . 
there be also a dog , a dingo dog . 
its ribs show , it be a yellow nondescript color , it suffer from a variety of sores , hair had scab off its body in patches . 
it lie with its head on its paws and only its eyes move , watch us carefully . 
it strike me as a very bright and very malnourished dog . 
no one pat the dog . 
it be not a pet . 
it be a worker . 
`` the buggers love shade '' , the rancher say . 
`` i suppose because it save them some loss of body water . 
they 'll move around that rock all day , follow the shade . 
during the hottest part of the day , of_course , the sun come straight down and there is n't any shade '' . 
we drive close_to the boulder , stop the land_rover , and walk over toward the family . 
the man was lean_against the rock . 
he gaze away from us as we approach . 
he be over six feet tall and very thin . 
his legs be narrow and very long . 
every bone and muscle in his body show , but he did not give the appearance of starve . 
he have long black hair and a wispy beard . 
the ridges over his eyes be huge and his eyelids be half shut . 
there be something about his face that disturb me and it take several seconds to realize what . 
it be not merely that flies were crawl over his face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawl into his eye_sockets . 
a fly would crawl down the bulging forehead , into the socket of the eye , walk along the man 's lashes and across the wet surface of the eyeball , and the eye did not blink . 
the australian and i both were wear insect_repellent and were not badly bother by insects , but my eyes water as we stand watch the aborigine . 
i turn to look at the lubra . 
she remain squat on her heels all_the_time we be there ; like the man , she be entirely naked . 
her long thin arms move in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family possessions which were place in_front of her . 
there be two rubbing sticks for make fire , two stones shaped roughly like knives , a woven-root container which hold a_few pounds of dried worms and the dead_body of some rodent . 
there be also a long wooden spear and a woomera , a spear-throwing device which give the spear an enormous velocity and high accuracy . 
there be also a boomerang , elaborately carved . 
everything was burnish with sweat and grease so_that all_of the objects seem to have been carve from the same material and to be ageless . 
the two children , both boys , wander around the australian and me for a_few moments and_then return to their work . 
they squat on their heels with their heads bend far forward , their eyes only a_few inches from the ground . 
they had locate the runway of a colony of ants and as the ants come_out of the ground , the boys pick them up , one at_a_time , and pinch them dead . 
the tiny bodies , drop onto a dry leaf , make a pile as big as a small apple . 
the odor here be more powerful than that which surround the town aborigines . 
the smell at_first be more surprising than unpleasant . 
it be also subtly familiar , for it be the odor of the human_body , but multiply innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathe . 
one 's impulse be to say that the smell be a stink and unpleasant . 
but that be a cliche and a dishonest one . 
the smell be sexual , but so powerfully so_that a civilized nose must deny it . 
their skin was cover with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which have almost the consistency of a second skin . 
they roll at night in ashes to keep warm and their second skin have a light dusty cast to_it . 
in_spots such_as the elbows and knees the second skin be wear_off and i realize the aborigines be much darker than they appear ; as if the coating of sweat , dirt , and ashes be a cosmetic . 
the boys have beautiful dark eyes and unlike their father they brush constantly at the flies and blink their eyes . 
`` that smell be something , eh , mate '' ? the australian ask . 
`` they swear that every person smell different and every family smell different from every_other . 
at the corroborees , when they get_to dance and sweat , you 'll see them rub up against a man who 's supposed to have a specially good smell . 
idje , here '' , and he nod at the man , `` is say to have great odor . 
the stink be all_the_same to me , but i really think they can make_out one another out blindfolded '' . 
`` here , idje , you fella like tabac '' ? he say sharply . 
idje still stare over our shoulders at the horizon . 
the australian stop try to talk a pidgin i could understand , and speak strange words from deep in his chest . 
it be a fortunate time in_which to build , for the seventeenth century be a great period in persian art . 
the architects , the tile and carpet makers , the potters , painters , calligraphers , and metalsmiths work through abbas 's reign and those of his successors to enrich the city . 
travelers enter from the desert were confound by what must have seem an illusion : a great garden fill with nightingales and roses , cut by canals and terraced promenades , stud with water_tanks of turquoise tile in_which were reflect the glistening blue curves of a_hundred domes . 
at the heart of all_of this be the square , which one such traveler declare to be `` as spacious , as pleasant and aromatick a market as any in the universe '' . 
in_time isfahan come to be known as `` half the world '' , isfahan_nisf-i-jahan . 
in the early eighteenth century this fantastic city , then the size of london , start to decline . 
the afghans invade ; the safavids fall from power ; the capital go elsewhere ; the desert encroach . 
isfahan become more of a legend than a place , and now it be for many people simply a name to_which they attach their notions of old persia and sometimes of the east . 
they think_of it as a kind_of spooky museum in_which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor . 
those who actually get there find that it be n't spooky at_all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight . 
but even for them it remain a museum , or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb , a tomb in_which persia lie well preserved but indeed dead . 
everyone be ready to grant the persians their history , but almost_no one be willing to acknowledge their present . 
it seem that for persia , and especially for this city , there be only two_times : the glorious past and the corrupt , depressing , sterile present . 
the one apparent connection between the two be a score of buildings which somehow or other have survive and which naturally enough are_called `` historical monuments '' . 
however , just_as all the buildings have not fall and flow back to their original mud , so the values which want them and see that they were_built have not all disappear . 
the values and talents which make the tile and the dome , the rug , the poem and the miniature , continue in certain social institutions which rise above the ordinary life of_this city , as the great buildings rise above blank walls and dirty lanes . 
often , too , the social institutions are house in these pavilions and palaces and bridges , for these great structures be not simply `` historical monuments '' ; they be the places where persians live . 
the promenade , for_example , continue to take_place on the chahar_bagh , a mile-long garden of plane and poplar_trees that now serve as the city 's principal street . 
? 
t take_place as_well along the terraces and through the arcades of the khaju bridge , and also in the gardens of the square . 
on fridays , the day when many persians relax with poetry , talk , and a samovar , people do not , it be true , stream into chehel_sotun - a pavilion and garden build by shah_abbas 2 , in the seventeenth century - but they do retire into hundreds of pavilions throughout the city and up the river valley , which be smaller , more humble copies of the former . 
and of_course religious life continue to center in the more famous mosques , and commercial life - very_much a social institution - in the bazaar . 
those three other great activities of the persians , the bath , the teahouse , and the zur khaneh ( the latter a kind_of club in_which a leader and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics , dance , chanted poetry , and music ) , do not take_place in buildings to_which entrance tickets are sell , but some of them occupy splendid examples of persian domestic architecture : 
long , domed , chalk-white rooms with daises of turquoise tile , their end walls cut_through to the orchards and the sky by open arches . 
but more important , and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often do not see , be that these places and activities be often the settings in_which persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities . 
water , air , fruit , poetry , music , the human form - these things be important to persians , and they experience them with an intense and discriminating awareness . 
i should like , by_the_way , to make it clear that i am not use the word `` persians '' carelessly . 
i do n't mean a_few aesthetes who play about with sensations , like a young prince in a miniature dabble his hand in a pool . 
these things be important to almost all persians and perhaps most important to the_most ordinary . 
the men cry love poems in an orchard on any summer 's night be as often as not the lutihaw , mustachioed toughs who spend most_of their lives in and out of the local prisons , brothels , and teahouses . 
a_few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord who in the dead of night lug me up a mountainside to drink from a spring famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor . 
not_long ago an acquaintance , a slick-headed water_rat of a lad up from the maw of the city , stand on the balcony puff his first cigarette in weeks . 
the air , he say , be just_right ; a cigarette would taste particularly good . 
i really did n't know what he mean . 
it be a nice day , granted . 
but he know ; he sniff the air and lick it on his lip and know as a vintner know a vintage . 
the natural world then , plus poetry and some kinds of art , receive from the_most ordinary of persians a great_deal of attention . 
the line of an eyebrow , the color of the skin , a ghazal from hafiz , the purity of spring_water , the long afternoon among the boughs which crowd the upper story of a pavilion - these things are notice , judge , and value . 
nowhere in isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the persians show so well as during the promenade at the khaju bridge . 
there has probably always be a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the city . 
for_one_thing , there be a natural belt of rock across the river_bed ; for another , it was here that one of the old caravan routes come_in . 
it was to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans , and also to make a pleasance for the city , that shah_abbas 2 , in about 1657 build , of sun-baked brick , tile , and stone , the present bridge . 
it be a splendid structure . 
from upstream it look_like a long arcaded box lay across the river ; from downstream , where the water_level be much lower , it be a high , elaborately facaded pavilion . 
the top story contain more_than thirty alcoves separate from each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile . 
at either end and in_the_center there be bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed and capacious as church apses . 
here , in the old days - when they had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks - sit the king and his court while priests , soldiers , and other members of the party lounge in the smaller alcoves between . 
below , twenty vaults tunnel through the understructure of the bridge . 
these are traverse by another line of vaults , and thus rooms , arch on all four sides , are form . 
down through the axis of the bridge there be a long diminishing vista like a visual echo of piers and arches , while the vaults front upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise , the mountains and river pools . 
here , on the hottest day , it be cool beneath the stone and fresh from the water flow in the sluices at the bottom of the vaults . 
on the downstream , or `` pavilion '' , side these vaults give out onto terraces twice_as wide as the bridge itself . 
from the terraces - eighteen in_all - broad flights_of_steps descend into the water or onto still more terraces barely above the level of the river . 
out of water , brick , and tile they have make far more_than just a bridge . 
on spring and summer evenings people leave their shops and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge . 
it be a great spectacle . 
the bridge itself rise up from the river , light-flared and enormous , like the outdoor set for an epic opera . 
crowds press along the terraces , down the steps , in and out of the arcades , mass against it as though it be a fortress under siege . 
all kinds come to walk in the promenade : 
merchants from the bazaar bicker over a deal ; a bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket ; dervishes who stand with the stillness of the blind , their eyes filmed with rheum and visions ; the old kajar princes arrive in their ancient limousines ; students , civil_servants , beggars , musicians , hawkers , and clowns . 
families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit on carpets around a samovar . 
below , people line the steps , as though on bleachers , to watch the sky and river . 
above , in the tiled prosceniums of the alcoves , boys sing the ghazals of hafiz and saadi , while at the very bottom , in the vaults , the toughs and blades of the city hoot and bang their drums , drink arak , play dice , and dance . 
here in an evening persians enjoy many_of the things which be important to them : poetry , water , the moon , a beautiful face . 
to a stranger their delight in these things may seem paradoxical , for persians chase the golden_calf as much_as any people . 
many_of them , moreover , are begin to complain about the scarcity of western amusements and to ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant , the mullah , and the peasant . 
nonetheless , they take time_out - much time - from the game of grab and these new western experiments to go_to the gardens and riverbanks . 
above_all , they will stop in_the_middle of anything , anywhere , to hear or quote some poetry . 
poetry in persian life be far more_than a common ground on_which - in a society deeply fissured by antagonisms - all may stand . 
it contain , in_fact , their whole outlook on life . 
and it is express , at_least to their taste , in a perfect form . 
poetry for a persian be nothing less_than truth and beauty . 
in most western cultures today these twins have been send away to the libraries and museums . 
in persia , where practically speak there be no museums or libraries or , for_that_matter , hardly_any books , the twins run free . 
it be perhaps difficult to conceive , but imagine that tonight on london bridge the teddy_boys of the east end will gather to sing marlowe , herrick , shakespeare , and perhaps some lyrics of their own . 
that , at_any_rate , be what happen at the khaju bridge . 
boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the top arcade . 
here in these little rooms - or stages arched open_to the sky and river - they choose a_few lines out of the hundreds they may know and sing them according to one of the modes into which persian music be divided . 
each mode is believe to have a specific attribute - one induce pleasure , another generosity , another love , and_so_on , to include all_of the emotions . 
the singer simply match the poem to a mode ; for_example , the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk poem : `` they bring me news that spring be in the plains and ahmad 's blood the crimson tulip stain ; go , tell his aged mother that her son fight with a_thousand foes , and he be one '' . 
or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet : `` know ye , fair folk who dwell on earth or shall hereafter come to birth , that here , with dust upon his eyes , iraj , the sweet-tongued singer , lie . 
in_this true lover 's tomb inter a world of love lie sepulchred '' . 
these songs ( practically all persian music , for_that_matter ) be limited to a range of two octaves . 
yet within this limitation there be an astonishing variety : design as intricate as that in the carpet or miniature , with the melodic_line like the painted or woven line often flow into an arabesque . 
die frist ist um , und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben jahr , the maestro quote the flying_dutchman , as he tell of his career and wanderings , explain that the number seven had significantly recur in his life several_times . 
the music_director of the pittsburgh symphony_orchestra , william_steinberg , has mold his group into a prominent musical_organization , which be his life . 
when he add to his pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the london_philharmonic_orchestra in 1958 , he conduct one_hundred fifty concerts within nine months , `` commute '' between the two cities . 
this schedule become too strenuous , even for the energetic and conscientious mr._steinberg . 
his london contract was rescind , and now , he explain cheerfully , as a bright smile lighten his intense , mobile face , `` i conduct only one_hundred and twenty concerts '' ! 
our meeting take_place in may , 1961 , during one of the maestro 's stop-overs in new_york , before he leave for europe . 
as we begin to converse in the lounge of his fifth_avenue hotel , his restlessness and sensitivity to light and sound become immediately apparent . 
seek an obscure , dark , relatively quiet corner in the airy room otherwise suffuse with afternoon sunshine , he ask if the soft background music could be turn_off . 
unfortunately , it be muzak , which automatically is pipe_in the public rooms , and which nolens volens had to be endure . 
as he talk_about himself , time_and_again stuff and drag on his pipe , steinberg begin to relax and the initial hurried feeling grow faint and was dispel . 
did he come from a musical family ? 
yes : though not professional musicians , they be a music-loving family . 
in his native cologne , where his mother teach him to play the piano , he be able to read notes before he learn the alphabet . 
she even devise a system of colors , whereby the boy could easily distinguish the different note values . 
when he start school at the age of five-and-a-half , he could not understand why the alphabet begin with the letter a , instead of c , as in the scale . 
because , like many other children , he intensely dislike practice czerny_etudes , he compose his own studies . 
when he be eight he begin violin_lessons . 
soon he was play in the cologne_municipal_orchestra , and during world_war 1 , , when musicians be scarce , he join the opera orchestra as_well . 
steinberg claim that these early years of orchestra participation be of invaluable help to his career . 
`` by observe the conductor '' , he say with a twinkle in his eyes , `` i learn how not to conduct '' . 
the musician run_away from school when he be fifteen , but this escapade did not save him from the gymnasium . 
simultaneously , he pursue his musical studies at the conservatory , receive sound training in counterpoint and harmony , as_well in the violin and piano . 
his professional career begin when he be twenty ; he become otto_klemperer 's personal assistant at the cologne_opera , and a year later was promote to the position of regular conductor . 
was n't this an unusually young age to fill such a responsible post ? 
yes , the maestro assent . 
had he always wish to be a conductor ? 
no , originally he had hope to become a concert pianist and had even perform as_such . 
however , when he assume the duties of a conductor , he relinquish his career as a pianist . 
five years were spend with the cologne_opera , after which he was call to prague by alexander_von_zemlinsky , teacher of arnold_scho ^ nberg and erich_korngold . 
in 1927 he succeed zemlinsky as opera director of the german theater at prague . 
during his tenure he also fulfill guest engagements at the berlin_state_opera . 
two years later he become director of the frankfurt_opera , where he remain until he lose this position in 1933 through the rise of the hitler regime . 
during these years the youthful conductor had contribute greatly to the high level of musical life in germany . 
he had present the first german performances of puccini 's manon_lescaut and de falla 's la_vida_breve . 
the frankfurt years be particularly noteworthy for his performance of berg 's wozzek soon after the berlin premiere under erich_kleiber , and the world premiere of scho ^ nberg 's von heute auf morgen . 
at the outset of his career , steinberg had dedicate himself to the advancement of contemporary music by vow to do a scho ^ nberg work every_year . 
in frankfurt , too , he direct the museum and opera_house concerts which , in_addition to the standard repertoire , feature novelties like erdmann 's piano_concerto and mahler 's sixth_symphony . 
because of the political upheaval in germany in the 1930 's , steinberg was force to restrict his activities to the jewish community . 
through the frankfurt_jewish_kulturbund he begin to give sonata recitals in synagogues , with cellist_emanuel_feuermann . 
as more_and_more jewish musicians lose their jobs with professional organizations steinberg unite them into the frankfurt_kulturbund_orchestra , which also give guest performances in other german cities . 
in 1936 he accept the leadership of the berlin_kulturbund . 
in the fall of_that year the best musicians of the berlin and frankfurt_kulturbund orchestras join under the combined efforts of bronislaw_hubermann and steinberg to become the palestine_orchestra - now known as the israel_philharmonic_orchestra - with steinberg as founder-conductor . 
in 1938 , at the insistence of arturo_toscanini , steinberg leave germany for the united_states , by way of switzerland . 
after he had spend the first three years in new_york as associate conductor , at toscanini 's invitation , of the nbc_orchestra , he make numerous guest appearances throughout the united_states and latin_america . 
in 1945 he become conductor of the buffalo_philharmonic . 
seven years later he was ask to become director of the pittsburgh_symphony . 
since 1944 he has also conduct regularly at the san_francisco opera , where he make his debut with a memorable performance of verdi 's falstaff . 
in recent years he has travel widely in europe , conduct in italy , france , austria , and switzerland . 
he return to germany for_the_first_time in 1953 , where he has since conduct in cologne , frankfurt , and berlin . 
where in europe was he go now ? 
first_of_all , to italy for a short vacation - forte_dei_marmi , a place he love . 
since it be not far from viareggio , he will visit puccini 's house , as he never fail to do , to pay his respects_to the memory of the composer of la_boheme , which he consider one of puccini 's masterpieces . 
steinberg speak with warmth and enthusiasm about italy : `` rome be my second home . 
i consider it the center of the world and make it a point to be there once a year '' . 
he will conduct two concerts at the accademia_di_santa_cecilia , as_well as concerts in munich and cologne . 
`` then i return to the united_states for engagements at the hollywood_bowl and in philadelphia '' , he add . 
the forthcoming season in pittsburgh also promise to be of unusual interest . 
there will be premieres of new works , make possible through ford_foundation commissions : carlisle_floyd 's mystery , with phyllis_curtin as soprano soloist . 
other world premieres will be gardner_read 's third_symphony and burle_marx 's samba_concertante . 
`` and next year we will do - also a ford commission - a piano concerto by elliott_carter , with jacob_lateiner as soloist . 
of_course , i shall conduct mahler and bruckner works in the coming season , as_usual . 
we 'll play bruckner 's fifth_symphony in the original version , and mahler 's seventh - the_least accessible , known , and played of mahler 's works . 
my pittsburghers have become real addicts to mahler and bruckner '' . 
he add that he also stress the works of these favorite masters on_tour , especially mahler 's first and fourth symphonies , and das_lied_von_der_erde , and bruckner 's sixth - which is rarely play - and seventh . 
bruckner 's eighth he refer to as `` my travel symphony '' . 
he recall that in california after a critic had attack him for `` still try to sell bruckner to the americans '' , the public 's response at the next concert be a standing_ovation . 
`` now that bruno_walter be virtually in retirement and my dear friend dimitri_mitropoulos be no_longer with us , i be probably the only one - with the possible exception of leonard_bernstein - who have this special affinity for and champion the works of bruckner and mahler '' . 
since he introduce so_much modern music , i could not resist ask how he feel about it . 
`` there be always and at_all_times a contemporary music and it express the era in_which it was create . 
but i usually stick_to the old phrase : ' ich habe ein amt , aber keine meinung ( i hold an office , but i do not feel entitle to have an opinion ) . 
i consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being write today '' . 
with all his musical activities , did he have the time and inclination to do anything else ? 
he had just pay a brief visit to the frick_collection to admire his favorite paintings by rembrandt and franz_hals . 
he be not enthusiastic over the newly acquired claude_lorrain , but reminisce with pleasure over a poussin exhibit he had be able to see in paris a year ago . 
and_how did he feel about modern art ? 
again steinberg be cautious and reply with a smile that he was not expose to_it enough to hazard comments . 
`` as my wife put it '' , he say , again with a twinkle in his eyes , `` all you know be your music . 
but after_all , you never learn anything else '' ! 
what did he do for relaxation ? 
like his late colleague , mitropoulos , he read mystery_stories , in_particular sir_arthur_conan_doyle . 
he cite heine and stendhal as favorites in literature . 
but his prime interest , apart from music , he insist seriously , be his family - his wife , daughter and son . 
at the moment he be excited about his son 's having receive the prix de rome in archaeology and was look_forward to be present this summer at the excavation of an etruscan tomb . 
`` both children be musical and my wife be a music_lover of unfailing instinct and judgment '' . 
`` is the attitude of german youth comparable_to that of '' the angry young_men ' of england '' ? be the topic for a round-table discussion at the bayerische_rundfunk in munich . 
i be chairman , the only not youthful participant . 
since attack serve to stimulate interest in broadcasts , i add to my opening statement a sentence in_which i claim that german youth seem to lack the enthusiasm which be a necessary ingredient of anger , and might be classify as uninterested and bored rather_than angry . 
i be far from convinced of the truth of my statement , but could not think_of anything that might evoke responses more_quickly . 
`` it be easy for you to talk '' ; counter a twenty year old law_student , `` you travel around the world . 
we would like to do that too '' . 
`` but you want a job guarantee when you return '' , i continue my attack . 
`` you must have some security '' , say a young clerk . 
when i mention that for my first long voyage i did not even have the money for the return fare , but had trust to luck that i would earn a sufficient amount , the young people look at me doubtingly . 
one girl express what be obviously in their minds . 
`` would you advise us to act the same way ? 
you might have fail . 
i think it be rather foolhardy to trust to luck '' . 
others mention that i might have had to ask friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in_a_foreign_country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international understanding . 
the debate need no additional controversy and soon i could ask each individually what he expect from life , what his hopes be and what his fears . 
though the four boys and two girls , the youngest nineteen years of_age , the oldest twenty-four , come from varying backgrounds and have different professional and personal interests , there be surprising agreement among them . 
what they wish for most be security ; what they fear most be war or political instability in their own country . 
the ideal home , they agree , would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms , just enough for a family consist_of husband , wife , and two children . 
no one want a larger family or no children , and none hoped_for a castle or say that live in less settled circumstances would be satisfactory . 
all express interest in world affairs but no one offer to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest . 
once_again , as in the days of the founding fathers , america face a stern test . 
that test , as president_kennedy forthrightly depict it in his state of the union message , will determine `` whether a nation organized and governed such_as ours can endure '' . 
it be well then that in_this hour both of `` national peril '' and of `` national opportunity '' we can take_counsel with the men who make the nation . 
incapable_of self-delusion , the founding fathers find the crisis of their time to be equally grave , and yet they have confidence that america would surmount it and that a republic of free peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world ache for liberty . 
seven founders - george_washington , benjamin_franklin , john_adams , thomas_jefferson , alexander_hamilton , james_madison and john_jay - determine the destinies of the new nation . 
in certain respects , their task be incomparably greater than ours today , for there be nobody before them to show them the way . 
as madison comment to jefferson in 1789 , `` we be in a wilderness without a single footstep to guide us . 
our successors will have an easier task '' . 
they think_of themselves , to use jefferson 's words , as `` the argonauts '' who had live in `` the heroic_age '' . 
accordingly , they take_pains special pains to preserve their papers as essential sources for posterity . 
their writings assume more_than dramatic or patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in_which they were involve be neither selfish nor parochial but , rather , as washington in his last wartime circular remind his fellow countrymen , that `` with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involve '' . 
strong men with strong opinions , frank to_the_point of be refreshingly indiscreet , the founding seven be essentially congenial minds , and their agreements with each other be more consequential than their differences . 
even_though in most cases the completion of the definitive editions of their writings be still years off , enough documentation has already been assemble to warrant draw a new composite profile of the leadership which perform the heroic dual feats of win american independence and found a new nation . 
before merge them into a common profile it be well to remember that their separate careers be extraordinary . 
certainly no other seven american statesmen from any later period achieve so_much in so concentrated a span of years . 
eldest of the seven , benjamin_franklin , a new_englander transplant to philadelphia , wrote the_most dazzling success story in our history . 
the young printer 's apprentice achieve greatness in a half-dozen different fields , as editor and publisher , scientist , inventor , philanthropist and statesman . 
author of the albany_plan of union , which , had it been adopt , might have avoid the revolution , he fight the colonists ' front-line battles in london , negotiate the treaty of alliance with france and the peace that end the war , head the state_government of pennsylvania , and exercise an important moderating influence at the federal_convention . 
on a military_mission for his native virginia the youthful george_washington touch_off the_french and indian_war , then guard his colony 's frontier as head of its militia . 
command the continental_army for six long years of the revolution , he be the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory . 
retire to his beloved mount_vernon , he return to preside over the federal_convention , and be the only man in history to be unanimously elect president . 
during his two terms the constitution was test and find workable , strong national policies were inaugurate , and the traditions and powers of the presidential office firmly fix . 
john_adams fashion much of pre-revolutionary radical ideology , write the constitution of his home state of massachusetts , negotiate , with franklin and jay , the peace with britain and serve as our first vice_president and our second president . 
his political opponent and lifetime friend , thomas_jefferson , achieve immortality through his authorship of the declaration_of_independence , but equally notable be the legal and constitutional reforms he institute in his native virginia , his role as father of our territorial system , and his acquisition of the louisiana_territory during his first term as president . 
during the greater part of jefferson 's career he enjoy the close collaboration of a fellow virginian , james_madison , eight years his junior . 
the active sponsor of jefferson 's measure for religious liberty in virginia , madison play the_most influential single role in the drafting of the constitution and in secure its ratification in virginia , found the first political_party in american history , and , as jefferson 's secretary_of_state and his successor in the presidency , guide the nation through the troubled years of our second war with britain . 
if franklin be an authentic genius , then alexander_hamilton , with his exceptional precocity , consuming energy , and high ambition , be a political prodigy . 
his revolutionary pamphlets , publish when he be only 19 , quickly bring him to the attention of the patriot leaders . 
principal author of `` the federalist '' , he swing new_york over from opposition to the constitution to ratification almost single-handedly . 
his collaboration with washington , begin when he be the general 's aide during the revolution , was resume when he enter the first cabinet as secretary of the treasury . 
his bold fiscal program and his broad interpretation of the constitution stand as durable contributions . 
less dazzling than hamilton , less eloquent than jefferson , john_jay command an equally high rank among the founding fathers . 
he serve as president of the continental_congress . 
he play the leading role in negotiate the treaty with great_britain that end the revolution , and direct america 's foreign affairs throughout the confederation period . 
as first chief_justice , his strong nationalist opinions anticipate john_marshall . 
he end his public career as a two-term governor of new_york . 
these seven founders constitute an intellectual and social elite , the_most respectable and disinterested leadership any revolution ever confessed . 
their social_status was achieve in some cases by birth , as with washington , jefferson and jay ; in others by business and professional acumen , as with franklin and adams , or , in hamilton 's case , by an influential marriage . 
unlike so many_of the power-starved intellectuals in underdeveloped nations of our own day , they command both prestige and influence before the revolution start . 
as different physically as the tall , angular jefferson be from the chubby , rotund adams , the seven be striking individualists . 
ardent , opinionated , even obstinate , they be amazingly articulate , write their own copy , and be masters of phrasemaking . 
capable_of enduring friendships , they be also stout controversialists , who could write with a drop of vitriol on their pens . 
john_adams dismiss john_dickinson , who vote against the declaration_of_independence , as `` a certain great fortune and piddling genius '' . 
washington castigate his critic , general_conway , as be capable_of `` all the meanness of intrigue to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity '' . 
and hamilton , who feel it `` a religious duty '' to oppose aaron_burr 's political ambitions , would have be a better actuarial risk had he show more literary restraint . 
the seven founders be completely dedicated_to the public_service . 
madison once remark : `` my life has be so_much a public one '' , a comment which fit the careers of the other six . 
franklin retire from editing and publishing at the age of 42 , and for the next forty-two years devote himself to public , scientific , and philanthropic interests . 
washington never have a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he love best , plantation management . 
he serve as commander_in_chief during the revolution without compensation . 
john_adams take_to_heart the advice give him by his legal mentor , jeremiah_gridley , to `` pursue the study of the law , rather_than the gain of_it '' . 
in take account of seventeen years of law_practice , adams conclude that `` no lawyer in america ever do so_much business as i did '' and `` for so little profit '' . 
when the revolution break_out , he , along with jefferson and jay , abandon his career at the bar , with considerable financial sacrifice . 
hamilton , poorest of the seven , give_up a brilliant law_practice to enter washington 's cabinet . 
while he was handle the multi-million-dollar funding operations of the government he had_to resort to borrow small sums from friends . 
`` if you can conveniently let me have twenty dollars '' , he write one friend in 1791 when he be secretary of the treasury . 
to support his large family hamilton go_back to the law after each spell of public_service . 
talleyrand pass his new_york law office one night on_the_way to a party . 
hamilton was bend over his desk , draft a legal paper by the light of a candle . 
the frenchman be astonished . 
`` i have just come from view a man who had make the fortune of his country , but now is work all night in_order_to support his family '' , he reflect . 
all seven combine ardent devotion to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality . 
john_adams assert in the continental_congress ' declaration of rights that the demands of the_colonies be in_accordance_with their charters , the_british constitution and the common_law , and jefferson appeal in the declaration_of_independence `` to the tribunal of the world '' for support of a revolution justify by `` the laws_of_nature and of nature 's god '' . 
they fight hard , but they be forgiving to former foes , and seek to prevent vindictive legislatures from confiscate tory property in violation of the treaty of 1783 . 
this sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplify in an exchange of letters between john_jay and a tory refugee , peter_van_schaack . 
jay had participate in the decision that exile his old friend van_schaack . 
yet when , at_war 's end , the ex-tory make the first move to resume correspondence , jay write him from paris , where he was negotiate the peace settlement : 
`` as an independent american i consider all who be not for us , and you amongst the rest , as against us , yet be assured that john_jay never cease to be the friend of peter_van_schaack '' . 
the latter in_turn assure him that `` were i arraign at the bar , and you my judge , i should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause '' . 
all seven recognize that independence be but the first_step toward build a nation . 
`` we have now a national character to establish '' , washington write in 1783 . 
`` think continentally '' , hamilton counsel the young nation . 
this new force , love_of_country , superimpose upon - if_not displace - affectionate ties to one 's own state , was epitomize by washington . 
his first inaugural_address speak of `` my country whose voice i can never hear but with veneration and love '' . 
all seek the fruition of_that nationalism in a federal_government with substantial powers . 
save jefferson , all participate in the framing or ratification of the federal_constitution . 
they support it , not as a perfect instrument , but as the best obtainable . 
historians have traditionally regard the great debates of the seventeen nineties as polarize the issues of centralized vs. limited government , with hamilton and the nationalists support the former and jefferson and madison uphold the latter position . 
the state 's rights position was formulate by jefferson and madison in the kentucky and virginia resolves , but in their later careers as heads_of_state the two prove themselves better hamiltonians than jeffersonians . 
in purchase louisiana , jefferson had_to adopt hamilton 's broad construction of the constitution , and so did madison in advocate the rechartering of hamilton 's bank , which he had so strenuously oppose at its inception , and in adopt a hamiltonian protective_tariff . 
indeed , the old jeffersonians be far more atune to the hamilton-oriented whigs than they be to the jacksonian democrats . 
when , in 1832 , the south_carolina nullifiers adopt the principle of state interposition which madison had advance in his old virginia_resolve , they elicit no encouragement from_that senior statesman . 
in his political testament , `` advice to my country '' , pen just before his death , madison express the wish `` that the union of the states be cherish and perpetuate . 
let the open enemy to_it be regard_as a pandora with her box opened ; and the disguised one , as the serpent creep with his deadly wiles into paradise '' . 
nostalgic yankee readers of erskine_caldwell are today inform by proud georgians that tobacco_road is bury beneath a four-lane super highway , over which travel each_day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the dow-jones average than with the cotton crop . 
thus we are compel to face the urbanization of the south - an urbanization which , despite its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the southern culture , has been utterly ignore by the bulk of southern writers . 
indeed , it seem that only in today 's southern fiction does tobacco_road , with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint_juleps , continue to live - but only as a weary , overexploited phantom . 
those writers known collectively as the `` southern school '' have receive accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize ; according to many critics , in_fact , the south has lead the north in literature since the civil_war , both quantitatively and qualitatively . 
such writers as william_faulkner and robert_penn_warren have lead the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort_of post-bellum renaissance . 
it is interesting , however , that despite this strong upsurge in southern writing , almost none of the writers has forsake the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel sip a mint_julep as he silently recount the revenue from the season 's cotton and tobacco crops ; of the stereotyped negro servants chant hymns as they plow the fields ; of these and a host of other antiquated legends that deny the south its progressive leaps of the past century . 
this be not to say that the south be no_longer agrarian ; such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification . 
but the south is , and has been for the past century , engage in a wide-sweeping urbanization which , oddly_enough , is not reflect in its literature . 
in 1900 the south be only 15  urban ; in 1950 it had become 47.1  urban . 
in a mere half-century the south has more_than triple its urban status . 
there is a new_south emerge , a south lose the folksy traditions of an agrarian society with the rapidity of an avalanche - especially within recent decades . 
as the new_south snowball toward further urbanization , it become more_and_more homogeneous with the north - a tendency which willard_thorp term `` yankeefication '' , as evidence in such cities as charlotte , birmingham , and houston . 
it is say that , even at the present stage of southern urbanization , such a city as atlanta be not distinctly unlike columbus or trenton . 
undoubtedly even the old southern stalwart richmond has feel the new wind : william_styron mention in his latest novel an avenue name for bankhead_mcgruder , a civil_war general , now rename , in typical california fashion , `` buena_vista_terrace '' . 
the effects of television and other mass_media are erase regional dialects and localisms with a startling force . 
as for progress , the `` backward south '' can boast of baton_rouge , which increase its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred and sixty-two percent , to 126000 , the second largest growth of the period for all cities over 25000 . 
the field , then , be ripe for new southerners to step_to_the_fore and write_of this twentieth-century phenomenon , the southern_yankeefication : the new urban economy , the city-dweller , the pains of transition , the labor problems ; the list be , obviously , endless . 
but these sources have not been tap . 
truman_capote is still revel in southern_gothicism , exaggerate the old southern legends into something beautiful and grotesque , but as unreal as - or even more unreal than - yesterday . 
william_styron , while face the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance , insist he is not to be classify as a southern writer and yet include traditional southern concepts in everything he publish . 
even the great god faulkner , the south 's one probable contender for literary immortality , has little concern himself with these matters ; such be simply not within his bounded province . 
where be the writers to treat these changes ? 
has the agrarian tradition become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism be somehow dreaded or unwanted ? 
perhaps present writers hypnotically cling_to the older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated testings over the decades . 
lack the pioneer spirit necessary to write_of a new economy , these writers seem to be content themselves with an old one that be now as defunct as confederate money . 
an example of the changes which have creep over the southern region may be see in the southern_negro 's quest for a position in the white-dominated society , a problem that has been reflect in regional fiction especially since 1865 . 
today the negro must discover his role in an industrialized south , which indicate that the racial aspect of the southern dilemma has n't change radically , but rather has gradually come to be reflect in_this new context , this new coat_of_paint . 
the negro face as much , if_not more , difficulty in fit himself into an urban economy as he did_in an agrarian one . 
this represent a gradual change in an ever-present social problem . 
but there have be abrupt_changes as_well : the sit-ins , the picket_lines , the bus strikes - all_of these be unheard-of even ten years ago . 
today 's evidence , such_as the fact that only three southern states ( south_carolina , alabama and mississippi ) still openly defy integration , would have astound many_of yesterday 's southerners into speechlessness . 
other examples of gradual changes that have affect the negro have be his move up , row by row , in the busses ; his request , and often get , higher wages , better working conditions , better schools - changes that were slowly emerge even before the supreme_court decision of 1954 . 
then come this decision , which speed the process of gain equality ( or perhaps hinder it ; only historical evolution will determine which ) : 
an abrupt_change . 
since 1954 the negro 's desire for social justice has lead to an ironically anarchical rebellion . 
he has frequently refuse to move from white lunch counters , refuse to obey local laws which he consider unjust , while in other cases he has appeal_to federal laws . 
this bold self-assertion , after decades of humble subservience , be indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon , an abrupt_change in the southern way of existence . 
a new order is thrust itself into being . 
a new south is emerge after the post-bellum years of hesitation , uncertainty , and lack of action from the negro in define his new role in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations of the white_man . 
the modern negro has not make a decisive debut into southern fiction . 
it is clear that , while most writers enjoy picture the negro as a woolly-headed , humble old agrarian who mutters `` yassuhs '' and `` sho ' nufs '' with blissful deference to his white employer ( or , in old_south terms , `` massuh '' ) , this stereotype is doom to become in_reality as obsolete as caldwell 's lester . 
while there may still be many faulknerian lucas beauchamps scattered through the rural south , such men appear to be a vanish breed . 
writers openly admit that the negro be easier to write than the white_man ; but they obviously mean by this , not a negro personality , but a negro type . 
present an individualized negro character , it would seem , be one of the_most difficult assignments a southern writer could tackle ; and the success of such an endeavor be , as suggest above , glaringly rare . 
just_as the negro situation point_up the gradual and abrupt_changes affect southern life , it also point_up the non-representation of urbanism in southern literature . 
the book concern with the negro 's role in an urban society be rare indeed ; recently only keith_wheeler 's novel , peaceable_lane , has openly face the problem . 
all_but the_most rabid of confederate_flag wavers admit that the old_southern tradition be defunct in actuality and sigh that its passing was_accompanied_by the disappearance of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid ante-bellum way_of_life . 
many earlier writers , mourn the demise of the old order , tend to romanticize and exaggerate this `` gracious old_south '' imagery , create such lasting impressions as margaret_mitchell 's `` tara '' plantation . 
modern writers , who be supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects , insist upon draw_out this legend , prolong its burial , when it well deserve a rest after the overexploitation of the past century . 
perhaps these writers have been too deeply move by this romanticize ; but they can hardly deny that , exaggerated or not , the old panorama be dead . 
as john_t._westbrook say in his article , `` twilight of southern_regionalism '' ( southwest_review , winter 1957 ) : `` the miasmal mausoleum where an old_south , already too minutely autopsied in prose and poetry , should be_left to rest in peace , forever dead and ( let us fervently hope ) forever done_with '' . 
westbrook further bemoan the southern writers ' creation of an unreal image of their homeland , which be too readily assimilate by both foreign readers and visiting yankees : `` our northerner be suspicious of all this crass evidence [ of urbanization ] present to his senses . 
it bewilder and befuddle him . 
he is too deeply steep in william_faulkner and robert_penn_warren . 
the fumes of progress be in his nose and the bright steel of industry tower before his eyes , but his heart be away in yoknapatawpha_county with razorback_hogs and night_riders . 
on this trip to_the_south he want , above_all else , to sniff the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at_least one barn burn at midnight '' . 
obviously , such a northern tourist 's purpose be somewhat akin to a child 's experience with disneyland : he want to see a world of make-believe . 
in_the_meantime , while the south has been undergo this phenomenal modernization that be so disappointing to the curious yankee , southern writers have certainly do little to reflect and promote their region 's progress . 
willard_thorp , in his new book american writing in the twentieth_century , observe , quite validly it seem : 
`` certain subjects be conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touch . 
no southern novelist has do for atlanta or birmingham what herrick , dreiser , and farrell do for chicago or dos_passos do for new_york . 
there be almost_no fictional treatments of the industrialized south '' . 
not a single southern author , major or minor , has make the urban problems of an urban south his primary source material . 
faulkner , for one , appear to be safe from the accusing fingers of all assailants in_this regard . 
faulkner culminate the southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it has ever been , or could ever be , do . 
he has make it his , and his it remain , irrevocably . 
he treat it with a mythological , universal application . 
as his disciples boast , even_though his emphasis be elsewhere , faulkner does show his awareness of the change order of the south quite keenly , as can be prove by a quick recalling of his sartoris and snopes families . 
even two decades ago in go_down , moses_faulkner was look_to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through its youth and its new way_of_life the south might be reborn and the curse of slavery erase from its soil . 
yet his concern even here be with a slowly changing socio-economic order in_general , and he never deal with such specific aspects of_this change as the urban and industrial impact . 
faulkner trace , in his vast and overpowering saga of yoknapatawpha_county , the gradual changes which seep into the south , building layer upon layer of minute , subtle innovation which eventually tend largely to hide the old way . 
thus faulkner remind us , and wisely , that the `` new '' south has gradually evolve out of the old_south , and consequently its agrarian roots persist . 
yet he present a realm of source material which may well serve other writers if_not himself : the problems with which a new_south must grapple in grope through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization . 
with new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of six men : a machine stand between the agrarian and his soil . 
the thousands of city migrants who desert the farms yearly must readjust with even greater stress and tension : the sacred wilderness is gradually surrender to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas . 
another element to concern the choreographer be that of the visual devices of the theatre . 
most avant-garde creators , true_to their interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement , have tend to dress their dancers in simple lines and solid colors ( often black ) and to give them a bare cyclorama for a setting . 
but robert_rauschenberg , the neo-dadaist artist , has collaborate with several of them . 
he has design a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white for mr._cunningham 's summerspace , so_that dancers and background merge into a shimmering unity . 
for mr._taylor 's images and reflections he make some diaphanous tents that alternately hide and reveal the performer , and a girl 's cape line with grass . 
mr._nikolais has make a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor . 
in_fact , he call his productions dance-theatre works of motion , shape , light , and sound . 
to raise the dancer out of his personal , pedestrian self , mr._nikolais has experiment with relate him to a larger , environmental orbit . 
he begin with masks to make the dancer identify himself with the creature he appear to be . 
he go_on to use objects - hoops , poles , capes - which he employ as extensions of the body of the dancer , who move with them . 
the depersonalization continue as the dancer was further metamorphose by the play of lights upon his figure . 
in each case , the object , the color , even the percussive sounds of the electronic score were design to become part of the theatrical being of the performer . 
the dancer who never loosen her hold on a parasol , begin to feel that it be part of herself . 
or , clad from_head_to_toe in fabric stretch over a series of hoops , the performer may well lose his sense of self in be a `` finial '' . 
as the dancer is depersonalize , his accouterments are animize , and the combined elements give_birth_to a new being . 
from this being come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single unit . 
thus , the avant-garde choreographers have extend the scope of materials available for dance composition . 
but , since they have reject both narrative and emotional continuity , how are they to unify the impressive array of materials at their disposal ? 
some look_to deliberately to devices use by creators in the other arts and apply corresponding methods to their own work . 
others , less consciously but quite probably influence by the trends of the times , experiment with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet , painter , and musician . 
an approach that has appeal to some choreographers be reminiscent_of charles_olson 's statement of the process of projective verse : `` one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception '' . 
the creator trust his intuition to lead him along a path that have internal validity because it mirror the reality of his experience . 
he disdain external restrictions - conventional syntax , traditional metre . 
the unit of form is determine subjectively : `` the heart , by_the_way of the breath , to the line '' . 
the test of form be fidelity to the experience , a gauge also accept by the abstract expressionist painters . 
an earlier but still influential school of painting , surrealism , had suggest the way of deal with the dream experience , that event in_which seemingly incongruous objects are link together through the curious associations of the subconscious . 
the resulting picture might appear a maze of restless confusions and contradictions , but it be more true_to_life than a portrait of an artificially contrived order . 
the contemporary painter tend to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but their essences as reveal in abstractions of their lines , colors , masses , and energies . 
he be still concern , however , with a personal event . 
he accept the accidents of his brushwork because they provide evidence of the vitality of the experience of creation . 
the work must be true_to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience . 
some painters have less interest in the experience of the moment , with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities , than in look beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher , more serene level of truth . 
rather_than put their trust in ephemeral sensations they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design , which symbolize an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world . 
the concept remain subjective . 
but in_this approach it be the artist 's ultimate insight , rather_than his immediate impressions , that give form to the work . 
others look_to more objective devices of order . 
the musician employ the serial technique of composition establish a mathematical system of rotations that , once set_in_motion , determine the sequence of pitches and even of rhythms and intensities . 
the composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of intervals ( or rhythms or dynamic changes ) . 
he may even alter the pattern by apply a scheme of random numbers . 
but he cannot order his elements by will , either rational or inspired . 
the system work as an impersonal mechanism . 
musicians who use the chance method also exclude subjective control of formal development . 
again , the composer must select his own materials . 
but a tossing of coins , with perhaps the added safeguard of reference_to the oracles of the i ching , the chinese book of changes , dictate the handling of the chosen materials . 
avant-garde choreographers , seek new forms of continuity for their new vocabulary of movements , have turn_to similar approaches . 
some let dances take their form from the experience of creation . 
according to katherine_litz , `` the becoming , the process of realization , be the dance '' . 
the process stipulate that the choreographer sense the quality of the initial movement he has discover and that he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it . 
the sequence may involve a sharp contrast : 
for_example , a quiet meditative sway of the body succeed by a violent leap ; or it may involve more subtle distinctions : 
the sway may be gradually minimize or enlarge , its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modify , or it may be transfer to become a movement of only the arms or the head . 
even the_least alteration will change the quality . 
an exploration of these possible relationships constitute the process of creation and thereby give form to the dance . 
the approach to the depiction of the experience of creation may be analytic , as it be for miss_litz , or spontaneous , as it be for merle_marsicano . 
she , too , be concerned with `` the becoming , the process of realization '' , but she does not think in_terms_of subtle variations of spatial or temporal patterns . 
the design is determine emotionally : `` i must reach into myself for the spring that will send me catapult recklessly into the chaos of event with which the dance confront me '' . 
look_back , miss_marsicano feel that her ideas may have been influence by those of jackson_pollock . 
at_one_time she feel impel to make dances that `` move all_over the stage '' , much_as pollock 's paintings move_violently over the full extent of the canvas . 
but her conscious need be to break_away from constricting patterns of form , a need to let the experience shape itself . 
midi_garth also believe in subjective continuity that begin with the feeling engender by an initial movement . 
it may be a free front-back swing of the leg , lead to a sideways swing of the arm that develop into a turn and the sensation of take_off from the ground . 
this become a dance called prelude to flight . 
a pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close_to the ground towards jumps into the air give the work its central focus . 
alwin_nikolais object to art as an outpouring of personal emotion . 
he seek to make his dancers more `` godlike '' by relate them to the impersonal elements of shape , light color , and sound . 
if his dancers are sometimes make to look as if they might be creatures from mars , this be consistent_with his intention of place them in the orbit of another world , a world in_which they are free of their pedestrian identities . 
it be through the metamorphosed dancer that the germ of form is discover . 
in his recognition of his impersonal self the dancer move , and this self , in the `` first revealed stroke of its existence '' , state the theme from which all else must follow . 
the theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve . 
it may be a reaction to a percussive sound , the following movements constitute further reactions . 
it may establish the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and color , in_which case changes in the light or color will set_off a kaleidescope of visual designs . 
unconcerned with the practical function of his actions , the dancer is engross exclusively in their `` motional content '' . 
movements unfold freely because they be uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive . 
but the metamorphosis must come first . 
though he be also concerned with free dance from pedestrian modes of activity , merce_cunningham has select a very different method for achieve his aim . 
he reject all subjectively motivated continuity , any line of action relate to the concept of cause and effect . 
he base his approach on the belief that anything can follow anything . 
an order can be chance rather_than choose , and this approach produce an experience that be `` free and discovered rather_than bound and remembered '' . 
thus , there be freshness not_only in the individual movements of the dance but in the shape of their continuity as_well . 
chance , he find , enable him to create `` a world beyond imagination '' . 
he cite with pleasure the comment of a lady , who exclaim after a concert : `` why , it 's extremely interesting . 
but i would never have think_of it myself '' . 
the sequence of movements in a cunningham dance be unlike any sequence to be see in life . 
at one side of the stage a dancer jump excitedly ; nearby , another sit motionless , while still another is twirl an umbrella . 
a man and a girl happen to meet ; they look straight at the audience , not at each other . 
he lift her , put_down her down , and walk off , neither pleased nor disturbed , as if nothing had happen . 
if one dancer slap another , the victim may do a pirouette , sit_down , or offer his assailant a fork and spoon . 
events occur without apparent reason . 
their consequences be irrelevant - or there be no consequences at_all . 
the sequence is determine by_chance , and mr._cunningham make use of any one of several chance devices . 
he may toss coins ; he may take slips_of_paper from a grab bag . 
the answers derive by these means may determine not_only the temporal organization of the dance but also its spatial design , special slips designate the location on_the_stage where the movement is to be_performed . 
the other variables include the dancer who is to perform the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance . 
the only factors that are personally set by the choreographer be the movements themselves , the number of the dancers , and the approximate total duration of the dance . 
the `` approximate '' be important , because even after the order of the work has been establish by the chance method , the result be not inviolable . 
each performance may be different . 
if a work is divide into several large segments , a last-minute drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the segments for any particular performance . 
and any sequence can not_only change its positions in the work but can even be eliminate from_it altogether . 
mr._cunningham try not to cheat the chance method ; he adhere to its dictates as faithfully as he can . 
however , there be always the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible to execute . 
then the choreographer must arbitrate . 
he must rearrange matters so_that two performers do not bump_into each other . 
he must construct transitions so_that a dancer who is tell to lie prone one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation for the leap . 
the north and the south be in greater agreement on sovereignty , through all their dispute about it , than be the founding fathers . 
the truth in their conflicting concepts was expound by statesmen of the calibre of webster and calhoun , and defend in_the_end by leaders of the nobility of lincoln and lee . 
the people everywhere had grow meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles , in understanding of and belief in the federal balance , and in_love of their union . 
repeated efforts - beginning_with the missouri_compromise of 1821 - were make by such master moderates as clay and douglas to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise , rather_than clear thought and timely action . 
even_so , confusion in_this period gain such strength ( from compromise and other factors ) that it lead to the bloodiest war of the nineteenth century . 
nothing can show more_than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lie_in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty . 
the present issue in atlantica - whether to transform an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens - resemble the american one of 1787 - 89 rather_than the one that was resolve by civil_war . 
and so i would only touch_on upon it now ( much_as i have long wanted to write a book about it ) . 
i think it be essential , however , to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts of sovereignty that go_to_war in 1861 - if only to see better how imperative be our need today to clarify completely our far worse confusion on this subject . 
the difference come_down to this : the southern states insist that the united_states be , in last analysis , what its name imply - a union of states . 
to their leaders the constitution be a compact make by the people of sovereign states , who therefore retain the right to secede from_it . 
this right of the state , its upholders contend , be essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of centralize power in the union government . 
the champions of the union maintain that the constitution had form , fundamentally , the united people of america , that it be a compact among sovereign citizens rather_than states , and that therefore the states have no right to secede , though the citizens could . 
write to speed on august 24 , 1855 , lincoln make the latter point clear . 
in homely terms whose timeliness be startling today , he thus declare his own right to secede . 
`` we begin by declare that all men be create equal . 
we now practically read it , all men be create equal except negroes . 
when the know-nothings get control , it will read , all men be create equal except negroes and foreigners and catholics . 
when it come to this , i shall prefer emigrate to some country where they make no pretence of love liberty - to russia , for_instance , where despotism can be take pure , without the base alloy of hypocrisy '' . 
[ his emphasis ] 
when the southern states exercise their `` right to secede '' , they form what they officially style `` the confederate_states_of_america '' . 
dictionaries , as we have see , still cite this government , along with the articles of confederation of 1781 , as an example of a confederacy . 
the fact be that the southern_confederacy differ from the earlier one almost as much_as the federal_constitution did . 
the confederate_constitution copy much of the federal_constitution verbatim , and most_of the rest in substance . 
it operate on , by and for the people individually just_as did the federal_constitution . 
it make substantially the same division of power between the central and state_governments , and among the executive , legislative and judicial branches . 
many believe - and understandably - that the great difference between the constitution of the southern_confederacy and the federal_constitution be that the former recognize the right of each state to secede . 
but though each of its members had assert this right against the union , the final constitution which the confederacy sign on march 11 - nearly a month before hostilities begin - include no explicit provision authorize a state to secede . 
its drafters discuss this vital point but leave_out it out of their constitution . 
their president , jefferson_davis , interpret their constitution to mean that it `` admit of no coerced association '' , but this remain so doubtful that `` there be frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the constitution '' . 
the constitution of the southern `` confederation '' differ from_that of the federal_union only in two important respects : it openly , defiantly , recognize slavery - an institution which the southerners of 1787 , even_though they continue it , find so impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoid mention the word in the federal_constitution . 
they recognize that slavery be a moral issue and not merely an economic interest , and that to recognize it explicitly in their constitution would be in explosive contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set_forth in the declaration of 1776 that `` all men are create equal , that they are endow by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among them be life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness '' . 
the other important difference between the two constitutions be that the president of the confederacy hold office for six ( instead of four ) years , and be limited to one term . 
these be not , however , differences in federal structure . 
the only important differences from_that standpoint , between the two constitutions , lie_in their preambles . 
the one of 1861 make clear that in make their government the people were act through their states , whereas the preamble of 1787 - 89 express , as clearly as language can , the opposite concept , that they were act directly as citizens . 
here be the two preambles : 
`` we the people of the united_states , in_order_to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide_for the common defence , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , do ordain and establish this constitution for the united_states_of_america '' . 
`` we the people of the confederate states , each state act in its sovereign and independent character , in_order_to form a permanent federal_government , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity - invoke the favor and the guidance of almighty_god - do ordain and establish this constitution for the confederate_states_of_america '' . 
one is tempt to say that , on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two preambles , the worst war of the nineteenth century was fight . 
but though the southern states , when draft a constitution to unite themselves , narrow the difference to this fine point by omit to assert the right to secede , the fact remain that by secede from the union they had already act_on the concept that it was compose primarily of sovereign states . 
if the union concede this to them , the same right must be concede to each remaining state whenever it see fit to secede : this would destroy the federal balance between it and the states , and in_the_end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gain by their union . 
lincoln see that the act of secession make the issue for the union a vital one : whether it be a union of sovereign citizens that should continue to live , or an association of sovereign states that must fall prey either to `` anarchy or despotism '' . 
much_as he abhor slavery , lincoln be always willing to concede to each `` slave_state '' the right to decide independently whether to continue or end it . 
though his election was interpret by many southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal balance in favor of the union , lincoln himself propose no such change in the rights the constitution give the states . 
after the war begin , he long refuse to permit emancipation of the slaves by union action even in the border states that stay with the union . 
he issue his emancipation_proclamation only when he feel that necessity leave him no other way to save the union . 
in his message of december 2 , 1862 , he put his purpose and his policy in these words - which i would call the lincoln_law of liberty-and-union : `` in give freedom to the slave , we assure freedom to the free '' . 
what lincoln could not concede be that the states rather_than the people be sovereign in the union . 
he fight to the end to preserve it as a `` government of the people , by the people , for the people '' . 
the fact that the americans who uphold the sovereignty of their states do this in_order_to keep many_of their people more securely in slavery - the antithesis of individual liberty - make the conflict grimmer , and the greater . 
out of_this ordeal the citizen emerge , in the south as in_the_north , as america 's true sovereign , in `` a new birth of freedom '' , as lincoln promise . 
but before_this come_about , 214938 americans had give their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights of men and of states . 
on their decisive battlefield lincoln did not distinguish between them when he pay tribute to the `` brave men , living and dead , who fight here '' . 
he understand that both sides be at_fault , and he reach the height of say so explicitly in his second inaugural . 
to my knowledge , lincoln remain the only head_of_state and commander-in-chief who , while fight a fearful war whose issue be in doubt , prove man enough to say this publicly - to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in_all human truth there be some error , and in_all our error , some truth . 
so great a man could not but understand , too , that the thing that move men to sacrifice their lives be not the error of their thought , which their opponents see and attack , but the truth which the latter do not see - any_more than they see the error which mar the truth they themselves defend . 
it is much less difficult now than in lincoln 's day to see that on both sides sovereign americans had give their lives in the civil_war to maintain the balance between the powers they had delegate to the states and to their union . 
they differ in the balance they believe essential to the sovereignty of the citizen - but the supreme sacrifice each make serve to maintain a still more fundamental truth : that individual life , liberty and happiness depend_on a right balance between the two - and on the limitation of sovereignty , in_all its aspects , which this involve . 
the 140414 americans who give `` the last full measure of devotion '' to prevent disunion , preserve individual freedom in the united_states from the dangers of anarchy , inherent in confederations , which throughout_history have prove fatal in_the_end to all associations compose primarily of sovereign states , and to the liberties of their people . 
but the fact that 70524 other americans give the same measure of devotion to an opposing concept serve liberty-and-union in other essential ways . 
its appeal from ballots to bullets at fort_sumter end by cost the southerners their right to have slaves - a right that be even_less compatible with the sovereignty of man . 
the very fact that they come so near to win by the wrong method , war , lead directly to their losing both the war and the wrong thing they fight for , since it force lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure . 
there was a divine justice in one wrong thus undo another . 
there was also a lesson , one that has serve ever since to keep americans , in their conflicts with one another , from turn from the ballot to the bullet . 
yet though the southern states lose the worst errors in their case , they did not lose the truth they fight for . 
the lives so many_of them give , to forestall what they believe would be a fatal encroachment by the union on the powers reserve to their states have continue ever since to safeguard all americans against freedom 's other foe . 
even hemingway , for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality in the sun also rises and a farewell to arms never maintain that sex be all . 
hemingway 's fiction is support by a `` moral '' backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hint at a religious dimension . 
and d._h._lawrence , in fantasia of the unconscious , protest vehemently against the overestimation of the sexual motive . 
though sex in some form or other enter into all human_activity and it was a good thing that freud emphasize this aspect of human nature , it is fantastic to explain everything in_terms_of sex . 
`` all be not sex '' , declare lawrence . 
man is not confine to one outlet for his vital energy . 
the creative urge , for_example , transcend the body and the self . 
but for the beat_generation all be sex . 
nothing be more revealing of the way_of_life and literary aspirations of_this group than their attitude toward sex . 
for the beatnik , like the hipster , be in_opposition to a society that be based on the repression of the sex instinct . 
he has elevate sex - not eros or libido but pure , spontaneous , uninhibited sex - to the rank of the godhead ; it be astarte , ishtar , venus , yahwe , dionysus , christ , the mysterious and divine orgone energy flow through the body of the universe . 
jazz be sex , marijuana be a stimulus to sex , the beat tempo is adjust to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse . 
lawrence_lipton , in the holy_barbarians , stress that for the beat_generation sex be more_than a source of pleasure ; it be a mystique , and their private language be rich_in the multivalent ambiguities of sexual reference so_that they dwell in a sexualized universe_of_discourse . 
the singular uncompromising force of their revolt against the cult of restraint is illustrate by their refusal to dance in a public place . 
the dance be but a disguised ritual for the expression of ungratified sexual_desire . 
for this reason , too , their language be more forthright and earthy . 
the beatniks crave a sexual experience in_which their whole being participate . 
it is therefore not surprising that they resist the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity , for like cats they be determined not to tame their sexual energy . 
they withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy the precepts of legalized propriety . 
unlike the heroes and flappers of the lost generation , they disdain the art of `` necking '' and `` petting '' . 
that be reserved for the squares . 
if they avoid the use of the pungent , outlawed four-letter word it is because it be taboo ; it be sacred . 
as lipton , the prophet of the beat_generation , declare : `` in the sexual act , the beat be filled with mana , the divine power . 
this be far from the vulgar , leering sexuality of the middle-class square in heat '' . 
this be the holy_grail these knights of the orgasm pursue , this be the irresistible cosmic urge to_which they respond . 
if wilhelm_reich be the moses who has lead them out of the egypt of sexual slavery , dylan_thomas be the poet who offer them the dionysian dialectic of justification for their indulgence in liquor , marijuana , sex , and jazz . 
in_addition , they have been convert to zen_buddhism , with its glorification of all that be `` natural '' and mysteriously alive , the sense that everything in the world be flowing . 
thus , paradoxically , the beat writers resort to `` religious '' metaphors : they be in search of mana , the spiritual , the numinous , but not anything connected with formal religion . 
what they be_after be the beatific vision . 
and zen_buddhism , though it is extremely difficult to understand how these internal contradictions are reconcile , help them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through sexual release . 
the style of life choose by the beat_generation , the rhythm and ritual they have adopt as uniquely their own , is design to enhance the value of the sexual experience . 
jazz be good not_only because it promote wholeness but because of its decided sexual effect . 
jazz be the musical language of sex , the vocabulary of the orgasm ; indeed , it is maintain that the sexual element in jazz , by free the listener of his inhibitions , can have therapeutic value . 
that be why , the argument run , the squares be so fearful of jazz and yet perversely fascinated by it . 
instead of give themselves spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them , they undergo psychoanalysis or flirt_with mysticism or turn_to prostitutes for satisfaction . 
thus jazz is transmute into something holy , the sacred road to integration of being . 
jazz , like sex , be a mystique . 
it be not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative impulse in unfettered man . 
the mystique of sex , combined with marijuana and jazz , is intend to provide a design for living . 
those who be sexually liberated can become creatively alive and free , their instincts put at the service of the imagination . 
righteous in their denunciation of all that make_for death , the beat prophets bid all men become cool cats ; let them learn to `` swing '' freely , to let_go , to become authentically themselves , and_then perhaps civilization will be save . 
the beatnik , secede from a society that be fatally afflicted with a deathward drive , be concerned with his personal salvation in the living present . 
if he be the child of nothingness , if he be the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars , then he will consult only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil . 
he will not curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that make him feel truly and fully alive , even if it is only for this brief moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explode on earth . 
that be why the members of the beat_generation proudly assume the title of the holy barbarians ; they will destroy the shrines , temples , museums , and churches of the state that be the implacable enemy of the life they believe_in . 
apart from the categorical_imperative they derive from the metaphysics of the orgasm , the only affirmation they be capable_of make be that art be their only refuge . 
their writing , born of their experiments in marijuana and untrammeled sexuality , reflect the extremity of their existential alienation . 
the mind has betray them , reason be the foe of life ; they will trust only their physical sensations , the wisdom of the body , the holy promptings of the unconscious . 
with lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate , but their faith in_love , inspire by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz , culminate in the climax of the orgasm . 
their work mirror the mentality of the psychopath , rootless and irresponsible . 
their rebellion against authoritarian society be not far removed from the violence of revolt characteristic of the juvenile_delinquent . 
and the life they lead be undisciplined and for_the_most_part unproductive , even_though they make a fetish of devote themselves to some creative pursuit - writing , painting , music . 
they be non-conformists on principle . 
when they express themselves it is incandescent hatred that shine forth , the rage of repudiation , the ecstasy of negation . 
it is sex that obsess them , sex that be at the basis of their aesthetic creed . 
what they discuss with dialectical seriousness be the degree to_which sex can inspire the muse . 
monogamy be the vice from which the abjectly fearful middle_class continue to suffer , whereas the beatnik have the courage to break_out of_that prison of respectability . 
one girl describe her past , her succession of broken marriages , the abortions she has have and finally confess that she love sex and see no reason why she must justify her passion . 
if it be an honest feeling , then why should she not yield to it ? 
`` most often '' , she say , `` it 's the monogamous relationship that be dishonest '' . 
there be nothing holy in wedlock . 
this girl soon drop the bourgeois pyschiatrist who disapprove of her life . 
she find married life stifling and every prolonged sex relationship unbearably monotonous . 
this confession serve to make clear in_part what be behind this sexual revolution : the craving for sensation for its own sake , the need for change , for new experiences . 
boredom be death . 
in the realm of physical sensations , sex reign supreme . 
hence the beatniks sustain themselves on marijuana , jazz , free swinging poetry , exhaust themselves in orgies of sex ; some of them are drive over the borderline of sanity and lose contact with reality . 
one beat poet compose a poem , `` lines on a tijuana_john '' , which contain a_few happy hints for survival . 
the new fact the initiates of_this cult have_to learn be that they must move toward simplicity . 
the professed mission of_this disaffiliated generation be to find a new way_of_life which they can express in poetry and fiction , but what they produce be unfortunately disordered , nourish solely on the hysteria of negation . 
who be the creative representatives of_this movement ? 
nymphomaniacs , junkies , homosexuals , drug_addicts , lesbians , alcoholics , the weak , the frustrated , the irresolute , the despairing , the derelicts and outcasts of society . 
they embrace independent poverty , usually with a `` shack-up '' partner who will help support them . 
they be full of contempt for the institution of matrimony . 
their previous legalized marriages do not count , for they hold the laws of the state null and void . 
they feel they are league against a hostile , persecutory world , face with the concerted malevolent opposition of squares and their hirelings , the police . 
this be the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defend their way_of_life , their search for wholeness , though their actual existence fail to reach these `` religious '' heights . 
one beatnik get the woman he was live with so involve in drugs and self-analysis and all-night sessions of sex that she was begin to crack_up . 
what obsessions had she pick_up during these long nights of talk ? 
sex as the creative principle of the universe , the secret of primitive religion , the life of myth . 
everything in_the_final_analysis reduce itself to sexual symbolism . 
in his chapter on `` the loveways of the beat_generation '' , lipton spare the reader none of the sordid details . 
no one ask questions about the free union of the sexes in west_venice so_long as the partners share the negative attitudes of the group . 
the women who come to west_venice , having forsake radicalism , be interested in live only for_the_moment , in be constantly on_the_move . 
others who are attract to this mecca of the beat_generation be homosexuals , heroin_addicts , and smalltime hoodlums . 
those who be sexual deviants are naturally draw to join the beatniks . 
since the homosexuals widely use marijuana , they do not have_to be initiate . 
part of the ritual of sex be the use of marijuana . 
as lipton put it : `` the eros is feel in the magic circle of marijuana with far greater force , as a unifying principle in human relationships , than at any other time except , perhaps , in the mutual metaphysical orgasms . 
the magic circle be , in_fact , a symbol of and preparation for the metaphysical orgasm '' . 
under the influence of marijuana the beatnik come_alive within and experience a wonderfully enhanced sense of self as if he had discover the open_sesame to the universe of being . 
carry high on this `` charge '' , he compose `` magical '' poetry that capture the organic rhythms of life in words . 
if he thus achieve a lyrical , dreamlike , drugged intensity , he pay the price for his indulgence by produce work - allen_ginsberg 's `` howl '' be a striking example of_this tendency - that be disoriented , dionysian but without depth and without apollonian control . 
for drugs be in themselves no royal_road to creativity . 
how is the beat poet to achieve unity of form when he is at_the_same_time engage in a systematic derangement of senses . 
if love reflect the nature of man , as ortega_y_gasset believe , if the person in_love betray decisively what he be by his behavior in_love , then the writers of the beat_generation are create a new literary genre . 
in most_of the less developed countries , however , such programing be at_best inadequate and at_worst nonexistent . 
only a very_few of the more advanced ones , such_as india and pakistan , have develop systematic techniques of programing . 
others have so-called development plans , but some of these be little more_than lists of projects collect from various ministries while others be statements of goals without analysis of the actions require to attain them . 
only rarely is attention give to accurate progress_reports and evaluation . 
neither growth nor a development program can be impose on a country ; it must express the nation 's own will and goal . 
nevertheless , we can administer an aid program in such a manner as to promote the development of responsible programing . 
first , we can encourage responsibility by establish as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the definition of objectives and the assessment of costs . 
second , we can make assistance for particular projects conditional on the consistency of such projects with the program . 
third , we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development which are adapt to the country 's objectives and resources . 
this include assistance in - assemble the basic economic , financial , technological , and educational information on_which programing depend ; survey the needs and requirements over time of broad sectors of the economy , such_as transport , agriculture , communication , industry , and power ; design the financial mechanisms of the economy in ways that will promote growth without inflation ; and administrative practices which will make possible the more effective review and implementation of programs once establish . 
the application of conditions in the allocation of aid funds cannot , of_course , be mechanical . 
it must be recognize that countries at different stages of development have very different capabilities of meet such conditions . 
to insist on a_level of performance in programing and budgeting completely beyond the capabilities of the recipient country would result in the frustration of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage more rapid_growth . 
in the more primitive areas , where the capacity to absorb and utilize external assistance be limited , some activities may be of such obvious priority that we may decide to support them before a well work_out program be available . 
thus , we might provide limited assistance in such fields as education , essential transport , communications , and agricultural improvement despite the absence of acceptable country programs . 
in such a case , however , we would encourage the recipient country to get_on with its programing task , supply it with substantial technical assistance in perform that task , and make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of our assistance to the country 's development be conditional upon programing progress being make . 
at the other end of the spectrum , where the more advanced countries can be rely_upon to make well thought through decisions as to project priorities within a consistent program , we should be prepared to depart substantially from detailed project approval as the basis for grant assistance and to move toward long-term support , in_cooperation with other developed countries , of the essential foreign_exchange requirements of the country 's development program . 
a systematic approach to development budgeting and programing be one important kind_of self-help . 
there be many others . 
it be vitally important that the new u._s. aid program should encourage all_of them , since the main thrust for development must come from the less developed countries themselves . 
external aid can only be marginal , although the margin , as in the case of the marshall plan , can be decisive . 
external aid can be effective only if it be a complement to self-help . 
u._s. aid , therefore , should increasingly be design to provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves can take . 
in establish conditions of self-help , it be important that we not expect countries to remake themselves in our image . 
open societies can take many forms , and within very broad limits recipients must be free to set their own goals and to devise their own institutions to achieve those goals . 
on_the_other_hand , it be no interference with sovereignty to point_out defects where they exist , such_as that a plan call_for factories without power to run them , or for institutions without trained personnel to staff them . 
once we have make clear that we be genuinely concerned with a country 's development potential , we can be blunt in suggest the technical conditions that must be meet for development to occur . 
the major areas of self-help be the following : 
this include not_only development programing , but also establish tax_policies design to raise equitably resources for investment ; fiscal and monetary policies design to prevent serious inflation ; and regulatory policies aim to attract the financial and managerial resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury consumption by a_few . 
this include foresee balance-of-payments crises , with adequate attention to reduce dependence on imports and adopt realistic exchange_rates to encourage infant industries and spur exports . 
it also include provide_for the training of nationals to operate projects after they are complete . 
for both economic and political reasons all segments of the population must be able to share_in the growth of a country . 
otherwise , development will not lead to longrun stability . 
in many societies , what we regard_as corruption , favoritism , and personal influence are so accept as consistent_with the mores of officialdom and so integral a part of routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their elimination will be regard by the local leadership as not_only unwarranted but unfriendly . 
yet an economy cannot get the_most out of its resources if dishonesty , corruption , and favoritism be widespread . 
moreover , tolerance by us of such practices result in serious waste and diversion of aid resources and in_the_long_run generate anti-american sentiment of a kind peculiarly damaging to our political interest . 
some of the_most dramatic successes of communism in win local support can be trace to the identification - correct or not - of communist regimes with personal honesty and pro-western regimes with corruption . 
a requirement of reasonably honest administration may be politically uncomfortable in the short run , but it be politically essential in_the_long_run . 
the united_states can use its aid as an incentive to self-help by respond with aid on a sustained basis , tailor to priority needs , to those countries make serious efforts in self-help . 
in many instances it can withhold or limit its aid to countries not_yet willing to make such efforts . 
there be other countries where , with skillful diplomacy , we may be able by our aid to give encouragement to those groups in government which would like to press forward with economic and social reform measures to promote growth . 
governments be rarely monolithic . 
but there will be still other countries where , despite the inadequacy of the level of self-help , we shall deem it wise , for political or military reasons , to give substantial economic assistance . 
even in these cases we should promote self-help by make it clear that our supporting assistance be subject to reduction and ultimately to termination . 
the_most fundamental concept of the new approach to economic aid be the focusing of our attention , our resources , and our energies on the effort to promote the economic and social development of the less developed countries . 
this be not a short-run goal . 
to have any success in_this effort , we must ourselves view it as an enterprise stretch over a considerable number of years , and we must encourage the recipients of our aid to view it in the same fashion . 
how long it will take to show substantial success in_this effort will vary greatly from country to country . 
in several significant cases , such_as india , a decade of concentrated effort can launch these countries into a stage in_which they can carry forward their own economic and social progress with little or no government-to-government assistance . 
these cases in_which light be already visible at the other end of the tunnel be ones which over the next few years will absorb the bulk of our capital assistance . 
the number of countries thus favorably situated be small , but their peoples constitute over half of the population of the underdeveloped world . 
meantime , over the decade of the sixties , we can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big push into self-sustaining growth . 
in still others which be barely on the threshold of the transition into modernity , the decade can bring significant progress in launch the slow process of develop their human resources and their basic services to_the_point where an expanded range of developmental activities be possible . 
the whole program must be conceive_of as an effort , stretch over a considerable number of years , to alter the basic social and economic_conditions in the less developed world . 
it must be recognize as a slow-acting tool design to prevent political and military crises such_as those recently confront in laos and cuba . 
it be not a tool for deal with these crises after they have erupt . 
many_of the individual projects for which development assistance is require call_for expenditures over lengthy periods . 
dams , river development schemes , transportation networks , educational systems require years to construct . 
moreover , on complex projects , design work must be complete and orders for machinery and equipment placed months or even years before construction can commence . 
thus , as a development program is being launch , commitments and obligations must be enter into in a given year which may exceed by twofold or threefold the expenditures to be make in_that year . 
the capital expansion programs of business_firms involve multi-year budgeting and the same be true of country development programs . 
more importantly , several of the more advanced of the less developed countries have find through experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for at_least 5 years forward and tentatively for considerably more_than that if they are to be sure that the various interdependent activities involved be all to take_place in the proper sequence . 
without such forward planning , investment_funds are waste because manufacturing facilities are complete before there be power to operate them or before there be transport to service them ; or a skilled labor_force is train before there be plants available in_which they can be employ . 
most important of all , the less developed countries must be persuade to take the necessary steps to allocate and commit their own resources . 
they must be induce to establish the necessary tax , fiscal , monetary , and regulatory policies . 
they must be persuade to adopt the other necessary self-help measures which are describe in the preceding section . 
the taking of these steps involve tough internal policy decisions . 
moreover , once these steps are take , they may require years to make themselves feel . 
they must , therefore , be relate to long-range development plans . 
if the less developed countries be to be persuade to adopt a long-term approach , the united_states , as the principal supplier of external aid , must be prepare to give long-term commitments . 
in_this , as in so many aspects of our development assistance activities , the incentive effects of the posture we take be the_most important ones . 
the extent to_which we can persuade the less developed countries to appraise their own resources , to set targets toward which they should be work , to establish in the light of_this forward perspective the_most urgent priorities for their immediate attention , and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves , all on a realistic long-term basis , will depend importantly on the incentives we place before them . 
if they feel that we are take a long-term view of their problems and are prepare to enter into reasonably long-term association with them in their development activities , they will be much more likely to undertake the difficult tasks require . 
perhaps the_most important incentive for them will be clear evidence that where other countries have do this kind_of home work we have respond with long-term commitments . 
you have hear him tell these young people that during his almost 50 years of service in the congress he has see the kaisers and the hitlers and the mussolinis , the tojos and stalins and khrushchevs , come and go and that we are pass_on to them the freest nation that mankind has ever know . 
then i have see the pride of country well in the eyes of these young people . 
so , i say , mr._speaker , god bless you and keep you for many years not_only for this body but for the united_states_of_america and the free_world . 
you remember the words of president_kennedy a week or_so ago , when someone ask him when he be in canada , and dean_rusk be in europe , and vice_president johnson be in asia , `` who is_running the store '' ? and he say `` the same fellow who has been_running it , sam_rayburn '' . 
mr._speaker , i ask unanimous consent that all members who desire to do so may extend their remarks at this point in the record ; and also that they may have 5 legislative days in_which to extend their remarks . 
is there objection to the request of the gentleman from massachusetts ? 
there be no objection . 
it be notably significant that so many members from both sides of the aisle express their respect and admiration for our beloved speaker , the honorable_sam_rayburn . 
i purposely refrain_from add the usual distinction of say that he be from the state of texas . 
i did so because i agree with so many here today , that he be the beloved speaker of all the people of the united_states . 
for the dignity , the influence , and the power of the legislative branch of our government - it be a privilege for us to do honor to this great man who represent not alone his own district but all the people of our country . 
to honor him be to honor ourselves . 
in_this my first year as a member of_this body i have experience many memorable moments . 
many_of these experiences be so important that they will be cherish forever by me . 
and , like many_of you here present , i hold as the highlight of all , the occasion of my first meeting with the honorable speaker of the house . 
at_that_time , he afford me the courtesy of his busy workday for such length as i may need , to speak about my background , my hopes , my views on various national and local topics , and any problems that i may have be vexed with at_the_time . 
he be fatherly in his handling of all subjects with me and tremendously wise in his counsel . 
in_conclusion , he wish me well - and as kindly and humbly as this humane gentleman could express himself , he ask to be_remembered to my wife and children . 
in my short period here i believe that at_no_time has he be otherwise than the_most popular man on both sides of the aisle . 
he be most effective in the ordinary business of the house , and in the legislative accomplishments of_this session , he easily rise to great occasion - even at the height of unpleasantness and exciting legislative struggle - and as the nation witness these contests , he rise , even as admit by those who differ with him , to the proportions of a hero and a noble partisan . 
i be highly privileged today to commemorate the brilliant career of_this parliamentary giant . 
he will ever be my example as a true statesman ; one who be thoroughly human , who affect no dignity , and who be endowed_with real ability , genuine worth , and sterling honesty - all dedicated_to secure the best interests of the country he has love and serve so_long . 
may the divine_speaker in heaven bless this country with sam_rayburn 's continued service here for years to come . 
it be a matter of deep personal satisfaction for me to add my voice to the great and distinguished chorus of my colleagues in_this paean of praise , respect , and affection for speaker_sam_rayburn . 
in_this hour of crisis , the wisdom , the dedication , the stabilizing force that he represent in current american government be an almost indispensable source of strength . 
he has become in_this half century the grand old_man of american history . 
it seem to me that the prayers of the whole free_world must rise like some vast petition to providence that sam_rayburn 's vigor and his life remain undiminished through the coming decades . 
here briefly in_this humble tribute i have seek for some simple and succinct summation that would define the immense service of_this patriot to his country . 
but the task be beyond me because i hold it impossible to compress in a sentence or two the complicated and prodigious contributions sam_rayburn has made as an individual , as a legislator , as a statesman and as a leader and conciliator , to the majestic progress of_this nation . 
it happen that i be a legislator from ohio and that i feel deeply about the needs , the aspirations , the interests of my district and my state . 
what sam_rayburn 's life prove to us all be the magnificent lesson in political_science that one can devotedly and with absolute dedication represent the seemingly provincial interests of one 's own community , one 's own district , one 's own state , and by that help himself represent even better the sweep and scope of the problems of_this the greatest nation of_all_time . 
for sam_rayburn never forget bonham , his home community , and he never forget texas . 
in the same way i like to think we owe our loyalty as legislators to our community , our district , our state . 
and , if we follow the rayburn pattern , as consciously or by an instinctual political sense i like to think i have follow it , then the very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflect in the devotion of our services to our country . 
for what sam_rayburn 's life in_this house teach us be that loyalty and character be not divisive and there be no such thing as be for your country and neglect your district . 
there be no such thing as be diligent about national affairs but indifferent about home needs . 
the two be as one . 
this may not be the greatest but it certainly come_close to be the greatest lesson sam_rayburn 's career , up_to this hour , teach all_of us who would aspire to distinction in political life under our processes of government . 
more_than that , sam_rayburn be the very living symbol of an iron-clad integrity so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrate that he can count some of his best friends in the opposition . 
through the_most rancorous battles of political controversy and the_most bitterly fought national and presidential campaigns his character shine as an example of dignity and honesty , forthrightness and nobility . 
sam_rayburn has never have to look_back at any of his most devastating fights and ever feel ashamed of his conduct as a combatant under_fire or his political manners in the heat of conflicting ambitions . 
this mean much to the american tradition . 
it be an answer in its way , individual and highly dramatic , to the charge that the democratic process be necessarily vicious in its campaign characteristics . 
and the name rayburn be one of the_most dominant in the history of american politics for the last half century . 
it be , i insist , hard to define the rayburn contribution to our political civilization because it be so massive and so widespread and so complicated , and because it go_deep so deep . 
but this we know : here be a great life that in every area of american politics give the american people occasion for pride and that has invest the democratic process with the_most decent qualities of honor , decency , and self-respect . 
i pray to god that he may be spare to us for many years to come for this be an influence the united_states and the whole world can ill afford to lose . 
all_but two of my nine terms in the house_of_representatives has been serve under the speakership of sam_rayburn . 
of_this i be proud . 
i have a distinct admiration for this man we honor today because of the humility with which he carry his greatness . 
and sam_rayburn be a great man - one who will go_down in american history as a truly great leader of the nation . 
he will be consider not_only great among his contemporaries , but as great among all the americans who have play a part in the country 's history since the beginning . 
i pay my personal tribute to sam_rayburn , stalwart texan and great american , not_only because today he establish a record of having serve as speaker of the house_of_representatives more_than twice_as long as henry_clay , but because of the contributions he has make to the welfare of the people of the nation during his almost half century of service as a member of congress . 
speaker_rayburn has not limit his leadership as a statesman to his direction of the house in the speaker 's chair . 
he have an outstanding record as a legislator since the start of his career in the house in 1913 , the 63 d congress . 
no one has sponsor more progressive and important legislation than has sam_rayburn . 
he be the recognized `` father '' of the rural_electrification_administration and the security and exchange_commission . 
but to run_the_gauntlet of the programs sam_rayburn bring into being through his legislative efforts would fill the pages of today 's record . 
no greater pleasure has come to me in my own service in_this house than to be present today to participate in_this tribute to this great speaker , this great legislator , this great texan , this great american . 
my sincere wish be that he continue to add to this record he set here today . 
sam_rayburn be one of the greatest american public figures in the history of our country and i consider that i have been signally honor in the privilege of know sam_rayburn and share with him the rights and obligations of a member of the house_of_representatives in the congress of the united_states . 
others may speak of speaker_rayburn ' s uniquely long and devoted service ; of his championship of many_of the progressive social measures which adorn our statute_books today , and of his cooperation in times of adversity with presidents of both of our major parties in help to pilot the ship of state through the shoals of today 's stormy international seas . 
i prefer to speak , however , of sam_rayburn , the person , rather_than sam_rayburn , the american institution . 
although sam_rayburn affect a gruff exterior in many instances , nevertheless he be fundamentally a man of warm heart and gentle disposition . 
no one could be more devoted than he to the american_congress as an institution and more aware_of its historical significance in the political history of the world , and i shall never forget his moving talks , deliver in simple yet eloquent words , upon the meaning of our jobs as representatives in the operation of representative government and their importance in the context of today 's assault upon popular government . 
above_all , he be a person to whom a fledgling representative can go to discuss the personal and professional problems which inevitably confront a new congressman . 
in_this role of father confessor , he has always be most characteristic and most helpful . 
on september 16 , sam_rayburn will have serve as speaker twice_as long as any predecessor and i be proud to join with others in mark this date , and in express my esteem for that notable american , sam_rayburn . 
the practice of state-owned vehicles for use of employees on business date_back over forty years . 
at_least one state vehicle be in existence in 1917 . 
the state presently own 389 passenger vehicles in comparison to approximately 200 in 1940 . 
the automobile maintenance unit , or motor_pool , come into existence in 1942 and has be responsible_for centralized maintenance and management of state-owned transportation since that time . 
the motor_pool has make exceptional progress in automotive management include establishment of cost billing systems , records keeping , analyses of vehicle use , and effect economies in vehicle operation . 
cars were operate in 1959 for an average .027 per mile . 
purchase of state vehicles is handle similarly to all state purchases . 
unit prices to the state be considerably lower than to the general public because of quantity purchases and no payment of state sales or federal excise_taxes . 
the legislature 's role in policy determination concerning state-owned vehicles has been confine almost exclusively to appropriate funds for vehicles . 
the meaningful policies govern the purchase , assignment , use and management of state vehicles have been shape by the state 's administrative officers . 
meaningful policies include : ( a ) kinds of cars the state should own , ( b ) when cars should be trade , ( c ) the need and assignment of vehicles , ( d ) use of cars in lieu of mileage allowances , ( e ) employees take cars home , and ( f ) need for liability insurance on state automobiles . 
a review of these policies indicate : 
the state purchase and assign grades of cars according_to_need and position status of driver and use of vehicle . 
the purchase of compact ( economy ) cars is being make currently on a test basis . 
cars are trade mostly on a three-year basis in the interest of economy . 
the factors govern need and assignment of cars be flexible according to circumstances . 
unsuccessful efforts have been make to replace high mileage allowances with state automobiles . 
it be reasonably economical for the state to have drivers garage state cars at their homes . 
the state has recently undertake liability insurance for drivers of state cars . 
a survey of practices and / or policies in other states concerning assignment and use of state automobiles reveal several points for comparison with rhode_island 's practices . 
forty-seven states assign or provide vehicles for employees on state business . 
two other states provide vehicles , but only with legislative approval . 
states which provide automobiles for employees assign them variously to the agency , the individual , or to a central pool . 
twenty-six states operate a central motor_pool for acquisition , allocation and / or maintenance of state-owned vehicles . 
nineteen states report laws , policies or regulations for assign state vehicles in lieu of pay mileage allowances . 
of these states the average `` change-over '' point ( at which a car is substitute for allowances ) be 13200 miles per_year . 
mileage allowances for state employees be of two types : ( a ) actual mileage and ( b ) fixed monthly allowances . 
actual mileage allowances be itemized reimbursements allow employees for the use of personally-owned vehicles on state business at the rate of .07 per mile . 
fixed monthly allowances be reimbursements for the same purpose except on a non-itemized basis . 
both allowances are govern by conditions and restrictions set_forth in_detail in the state 's travel regulations . 
rhode_island 's reimburseable rate of .07 per mile for use of personally-owned cars compare favorably with other states ' rates . 
the average of states ' rates be .076 per mile . 
rhode_island 's rate of .07 per mile be considerably lower than reimburseable rates in the federal_government and in industry nationally which approximate a .09 per mile average . 
actual mileage allowances be well-administered and not unduly expensive for the state . 
the travel regulations , requirements and procedures govern reimbursement are control properly and not overly restrictive . 
fixed monthly allowances be a controversial subject . 
they have a great advantage in ease of audit time and payment . 
however , they lend_oneself to abuse and inadequate control measures . 
flat payments over $ 50 per month be more expensive to the state than the assignment of state-owned vehicles . 
travel_allowances , include subsistence , have been revise by administrative_officials recently and compare favorably with other states ' allowances . 
with few exceptions travelers on state business are allow actual travel expenses and $ 15 per day subsistence . 
travel_allowances be well-regulated and pose little problem in administration and / or audit control . 
it be difficult to pinpoint the time_of_origin of the state purchase automobiles for use of employees in rhode_island . 
few records be available concern the subject prior to 1940 . 
those that be available shed_light_on little light . 
the registry of motor_vehicles indicate that at_least one state automobile was register as far back as 1917 . 
it should be enough to say that the practice of the state buy automobiles be at_least forty years old . 
the best reason that can be advance for the state adopt the practice be the advent of expanded highway construction during the 1920 s and ' 30 s . 
at_that_time highway_engineers travel rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties . 
use privately-owned vehicles be a personal hardship for such employees , and the_matter of provide state transportation was feel perfectly justifiable . 
once the principle was establish , the increase in state-owned vehicles come rapidly . 
and reasons other_than employee need contribute to the growth . 
table 1 immediately below show the rate_of_growth of vehicles and employees . 
this rate of increase does not signify anything in itself . 
it does not indicate loose management , ineffective controls or poor policy . 
but it does show that automobiles have increase steadily over the years and in almost the same proportion to the increase of state employees . 
in_the_past twenty years the ratio of state-owned automobiles per state employees has vary from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now . 
whether there be too few automobiles in 1940 or too many now be problematical . 
the fact be simply that state-owned vehicles have remain in practically the same proportion as employees to use them . 
while the origin of state-owned automobiles may be obscure , subsequent developments concern the assignment , use , and management of state automobiles can be_related more clearly . 
prior to 1942 , automobiles be the individual responsibility of the agency to_which assign . 
this responsibility include all phases of management . 
it embrace determine when to purchase and when to trade vehicles , who was to drive , when and where repairs were to be make , where gasoline and automobile services were to be obtain and other allied matters . 
in 1942 , however , the nation be at_war . 
gasoline and automobile_tires be rationed commodities . 
the state was confront with transportation problems similar to those of the individual . 
it meet these problems by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit ( more popularly called the motor_pool ) , a centralized operation for the maintenance and control of all state transportation . 
the motor_pool then , as now , have headquarter facilities in providence and other garages located throughout the state . 
it be organizationally the responsibility of the department of public_works and was finance on a rotary fund basis with each agency of government contribute to the pool 's operation . 
in 1951 the pool 's operation was transfer to the newly-created department of administration , an agency establish as the central staff and auxiliary department of the state_government . 
the management of state-owned vehicles since that time has been describe in a recent report in the following manner : `` under this new management considerable progress appear to have been make . 
the agencies of government are now bill for the actual cost of services provide to each passenger_car rather_than the prior uniform charge for all cars . 
whereas the maintenance rotary fund had in_the_past sustain losses considerably beyond expectations , the introduction of the cost-billing system plus other control refinements has result in keep the fund on a proper working basis . 
one indication of the merits of the new management is find in the fact that during the period 1951 - 1956 , while total annual mileage put_on the vehicles increase 35  , the total maintenance cost increase only 11  . 
'' in_order_to further refine the management of passenger vehicles , on july_1 , 1958 , the actual title to every vehicle was transfer , by executive_order , to the division of methods , research and office services . 
the objective behind this action be to place in one agency the responsibility for the management , assignment , and replacement of all vehicles . 
( note : so_far as state police_cars are_concerned , only their replacement be under this division ) . 
this tie_in closely with the current attempt to upgrade state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles are not retain beyond the point where maintenance costs ( in light of depreciation ) become excessive . 
moreover , it allow the present management to reassign vehicles so_that mileage will be more uniformly distribute throughout the fleet ; for_example , if one driver put_on 22000 miles per_year and another driver 8000 miles per_year , their cars will be switch so_that both cars will have 30000 miles after two years , rather_than 44000 miles ( and related higher maintenance costs ) and 16000 miles respectively `` . 
the motor_pool be a completely centralized and mechanized operation . 
it handle all types of vehicle maintenance , but concentrate_on more on `` service_station activities '' than on extensive vehicle repairs . 
it contract with outside repair garages for much of the latter work . 
where the pool excel be in its compilation of maintenance and cost-data studies and analyses . 
pool records reveal in_detail the cost per mile and miles_per_gallon of each vehicle , the miles travel in one year or three years , the periods when vehicle costs become excessive , and when cars should be trade for sound economies . 
from this , motor_pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data . 
in 1959 - 60 , vehicles average an operating_cost of .027 per mile . 
base on this figure and consider depreciation costs of vehicles , pool personnel have determine that travel in_excess of 10000 miles annually be more economical by state car than by payment of allowances for use of personally-owned vehicles . 
they estimate further that with sufficient experience and when cost-data of compact_cars is compile , the break-even point may be reduce to 7500 miles of travel per_year . 
table 2 show operating_cost data of state vehicles select at_random . 
one matter of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operations be the lack of adequate central garage facilities . 
present pool quarters at two locations in providence be crowded , antiquated and , in_general , make_for inefficient operation in_terms_of dispersement of personnel and duplication of such operational needs as stock and repair equipment . 
good facilities would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle costs even more . 
the purchase of state-owned vehicles is handle in the same manner as all other purchases of the state . 
requests are make by the motor_pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agencies to_which assignments of cars will be make . 
bids are evaluate by the division of purchases with the assistance of pool staff , and awards for the purchase of the automobiles are make to the lowest responsible bidders . 
unit prices for state vehicles be invariably lower than to the general public . 
the reasons be obvious : ( 1 ) the state is buy in quantity , and ( 2 ) it have no federal excise or state sales_tax to pay . 
until 1958 the state be also entitled to a special type of manufacturers ' discount through the dealers . 
in_that ownership of all vehicles rest_on with the state motor_pool , cars are pay for with funds appropriate to the agencies but transfer to the rotary fund mention earlier . 
this be a normal governmental procedure which reflect more accurately cost-accounting principles . 
the assignment and use of vehicles after purchase be another matter to be cover in_detail later . 
probably the_most important of all matters for review be the broad administrative policies govern the purchase , assignment , use , and management of state vehicles . 
the legislature 's role in policy determination in_this area for years has been confine almost solely to the amount of funds appropriate annually for the purchase and operation of vehicles . 
the more meaningful policies have been_left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer of the state - the director of administration . 
there be a time some years ago when local taxation by the cities and towns be sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state_government as_well . 
for many years a state tax on cities and towns was pay by the several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property_tax . 
this tax was discontinue in 1936 . 
since that time the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have place financial burdens on the state which could not have been foresee in earlier years . 
at_the_same_time there has be an upgrading and expansion of municipal services as_well . 
thus , there has come_into_being a situation in_which the state must raise all_of its own revenues and , in_addition , must give assistance to its local_governments . 
this financial assistance from the state has become necessary because the local_governments themselves find the property_tax , or at_least at the rates then exist , insufficient for their requirements . 
consequently there have develop several forms of grants-in-aid and shared taxes , as_well as the unrestricted grant to local_governments for general purposes whose adoption accompany the introduction of a sales_tax at the state level . 
notwithstanding state aid , the local_governments are continue to seek additional revenue of their own by strengthen the property_tax . 
this is being do both by the revaluation of real_property and by seek_out forms of personal_property hitherto neglect or ignore . 
taxation of tangible movable property in rhode_island has be generally of a `` hands off '' nature due possibly to several reasons : ( 1 ) local assessors , in_the_main , be not well pay and have inadequate office_staffs , ( 2 ) the numerous categories of_this component of personal_property make locating extremely difficult , and ( 3 ) the inexperience of the majority of assessors in evaluate this type of property . 
among the many problems in the taxing of personal_property , and of movable tangible property in_particular , two be significant : ( 1 ) situs , ( 2 ) fair and equitable assessment of value . 
these problems be not local to rhode_island , but are recognize as common to all states . 
although the laws of the various states , in_general , specify the situs of property , i. e. , residence or domicile of the owner , or location of the property , the exceptions regard boats , airplanes , mobile_homes , etc. , seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment . 
rhode_island law specify that all real_estate be taxable in the town in_which it be situated . 
it also provide for the taxation of all personal_property , belong to inhabitants of the state , both tangible and intangible , and the tangible personal_property of non-residents in_this state . 
in define personal_property , it specifically mention `` all ships or vessels , at_home or abroad '' . 
intangible property be taxable wherever the owner have a place of abode the greater portion of the year . 
although a similar situs for tangible property is mention in the statute , this is cancel_out by the provision that definite kinds of property `` and all other tangible property '' situated or be in any town be taxable where the property be situated . 
this would seem to fix the tax situs of all movable personal_property at its location on december 31 . 
both boats and aircraft would fall within this category , as_well as motor_vehicles . 
the location of the latter now is determine for tax purposes at_the_time of registration , and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor_vehicle as be situated where it is garage . 
obviously , it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the 31 st day of december . 
in_view of the acceptance accord the status of motor_vehicles for tax purposes , in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or aircraft . 
a recent example of_this problem be the flying of six airplanes , on december 31 , 1960 , from the newport_airpark in middletown , to_the_north central_airport in smithfield . 
this situation result in both towns claim the tax , and probably justifiably . 
middletown base its claim on the general provision of the law that `` all rateable property , both tangible and intangible , shall be tax to the owner thereof in the town in_which such owner shall have have his actual place of abode for the larger portion of the twelve ( 12 ) months next precede the first day of april in each_year '' . 
the smithfield tax_assessor , in_turn , claim the tax under the provision of law `` and all other tangible personal_property situate or be in any town , in or upon any place of storage * * h shall be tax to such person in the town where said property be situated '' . 
this problem of fair and equitable assessment of value be a difficult one to solve in_that the determination of fair valuation be dependent_on local assessors , who in_general be non-professional and part-time personnel take an individualistic approach to the problem . 
this account_for the wide variance in assessment practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in rhode_island . 
this condition will undoubtedly continue until such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is establish , or through mutual agreement of the local assessing officials for a method of standard assessment practice to be adopt . 
the rhode_island public_expenditure_council in its publication once comment : `` the_most realistic way of face_up to this problem would be to have the state take_over full responsibility for assess all taxable property . 
an adequately staffed and equipped state assessing office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go_far toward produce equitable assessments on all properties throughout the state . 
a single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences and complications that be inherent in a system of 39 different and independent assessing units '' . 
the institute of public_administration , in its report to the state_fiscal_study_commission in 1959 , recommend `` consolidate and centralize all aspects of property_tax administration in a single state agency professionally organized and equipped for the job '' . 
the resulting setup , it was declare , `` would be similar to_that which be in successful operation in a_number_of metropolitan counties as large or larger than rhode_island '' . 
to determine the practice and attitude of municipal_governments concerning tangible movable property , a questionnaire was send to all local_government assessors or boards of assessors in rhode_island . 
the replies from each individual town are not give in detail because the questions ask the personal opinion of the several assessors and be not necessarily the established policy of the town in each case . 
there are legitimate reasons for differences_of_opinion among the assessors as_a_whole and among the public officials in each town . 
these opinions of the assessors be of significance in indicate what their thinking seem to be at_the_present_time . 
in_reply to a question of whether they now tax boats , airplanes and other movable property exclude automobiles , nineteen say that they did and twenty that they did not . 
the wording of the question be quite general and may have be subject to different interpretations . 
one assessor check boats only , another trailers and tractors , one mention house_trailers , and two others refer to trailers without specify the type . 
in two cases , airplanes only were indicate . 
it be difficult to tabulate exactly what was mean in each individual situation , but the conclusion may be drawn that 21 towns do not assess movable personal_property , and of the remainder only certain types are value for tax purposes . 
boats were indicate specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats . 
it would seem , then , that movable property and equipment is not tax as_a_whole but that certain types are tax in towns where this be bound_to be expedient for that particular kind_of personal_property . 
so few answer the question relate to their efforts to assess movable property that the results be inconclusive . 
only four towns indicate that they make any_more than a normal effort to list property of_this kind . 
of greater interest be a question as to whether movable property was assess according to its location or ownership . 
fifteen state that it be according to location , four by residence of the owner , and nineteen did not answer . 
twenty-seven assessors state that they be in favor of improved means for assess movable personal_property , and only five be opposed . 
seven others express no opinion . 
on this point there be fairly general_agreement that assessors would like to do more_than they are do now . 
it be not clear , however , whether they are think_of all movable property or only of boats , trailers , aircraft or certain other types of personal_property whose assessment would be advantageous to their particular towns . 
another question that was ask of the assessors be whether they favor the assessment of movable property at its location or at the residence of the owner . 
eighteen vote for assessment by the town in_which it be located and eleven prefer assessment by the town in_which the owner reside . 
ten others make no reply . 
of those who have an opinion , it seem that assessment by location is prefer . 
there be one vote for location be the place where the property be situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment date . 
to summarize , it may be say that there be no one prevailing practice in rhode_island with_respect_to the taxation of movable property , that assessors would like to see an improvement , and of those who have an opinion , that assessment by the town of location is prefer on the basis of their present knowledge . 
the need for greater knowledge be evident from their replies . 
interest has been show for a_number_of years by local assessors in the possibility of tax boats . 
assessors in rhode_island are charge not_only with place a valuation upon real and personal_property , but they also have the responsibility to raise by a tax `` a sum not less_than nor more_than '' a specified amount as order by a city_council or financial town_meeting . 
it has be obvious to the assessors , particularly those in shore communities , that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal_property which they have be unable to reach . 
through their professional organization , the rhode_island tax officials association the question of tax boats long has been debate and discuss . 
no satisfactory solution has been find , but this be_due more to the difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence on the part of the assessors . 
it has been estimate that the value of boats in rhode_island waters be something in_excess of fifty million dollars , exclude commercial boats . 
it be obvious that this be a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessors of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be subject to taxation . 
it is know that at_least five towns ( barrington , bristol , narragansett , newport and westerly ) place some value on some boats for tax purposes . 
however , few are tax , and the owners and location of most boats be unknown to the assessors on the date of assessment of town valuations . 
no one really know how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may be . 
slightly more_than 5000 boats were register with the coast_guard prior to the recent passage of the state boating law . 
only a_few_more than 10000 boats had been register with the division of harbors and rivers at the end of the 1960 boating season , but many had been take_out of the water early when the threat of a hurricane bring the season to an early close . 
the assessors ' association , meet at narragansett in september 1960 , devote its session to a discussion of the boat problem . 
local industry 's investment in rhode_island be the big story in 1960 's industrial development effort . 
fifty-two companies start or commit themselves to new plant construction , total 1418000 square_feet and represent an investment of $ 11900000 ; a new post-world_war 2 , record . 
with minor exceptions , this expansion was institute either by firms based in rhode_island or out-of-state manufacturers already operate here . 
what make these new location figures particularly impressive be the fact that although 1960 be a year of mild business recession throughout the nation , rhode_island score marked progress in new industry , new plants , and new jobs . 
of the major expansions in 1960 , three were finance under the r._i._industrial_building_authority 's 100  guaranteed mortgage plan : collyer_wire , leesona_corporation , and american_tube + controls . 
leading firms that arrange their own financing include speidel_corporation , cornell-dubilier , photek , inc._division of textron , narragansett_gray iron_foundry , w._r._cobb_company , and mays_manufacturing_company . 
expansion and relocation of industry in rhode_island be the direct responsibility of the development_council 's industrial_division , and the figures quote above indicate a successful year 's operation . 
industrial_division personnel work with 54 out-of-state and 97 rhode_island concerns during 1960 , many_of whom be still interested in a rhode_island location . 
they be conscious_of this state 's new feeling of optimism and assurance and be definitely impressed by the number of new plants and construction projects in rhode_island . 
although much of the industrial_division 's promotional effort is devote to secure new locations and expansions by major industries , small business is also afford considerable attention . 
our office of foreign and domestic commerce carry_on a vigorous program , directly aim at solve and expedite the problems of manufacturers in the lower employment categories . 
a primary function be the operation of a government_bid_center , which receive bids daily from the federal_government 's principal purchasing agencies . 
assistance is render to interested rhode_island businessmen concerning interpretation of bid invitations , where to obtain specifications , and follow-ups concerning qualification .

this office cooperate with the u._s. department_of_commerce in give statewide coverage to services which include : statistics on markets abroad ; locate foreign_agents , buyers , distributors , etc. ; information on foreign and domestic import_duties and regulations , licensing , investments , and establish of branch representatives or plants abroad , and documentary requirements concerning export shipments and arrangements for payment . 
during the year 1960 , this office supply 954 visitors with information related to foreign and domestic commerce , and make 73 field visits . 
our media advertising continue , during 1960 , its previous effective program that stress such specifics as 100  financing , plant availabilities , and location advantages . 
we also continue to run a series of ads feature endorsement of rhode_island by industrialists who had recently establish new plants here . 
to reach a still greater audience of location-minded manufacturers , our industrial advertising budget for the fiscal_year was increase from $ 32000 to $ 40000 , and the industrial_building_authority 's financial participation was up from $ 17000 to $ 20000 . 
newspaper advertising was mainly concentrate in the new_york times and the wall_street journal ( eastern and midwestern editions ) which average two prominent ads per month , and to_a_lesser_degree the new_york herald_tribune and , for the west coast , the los_angeles times and the wall_street journal ( pacific_coast edition ) .

two hundred and nineteen were receive from 35 of our 50 united_states and 11 come from foreign countries . 
new_york lead in the number of inquiries , follow by california , new_jersey , massachusetts , and pennsylvania . 
among foreign countries respond be germany , canada , brazil and india . 
an important operation in solicit industrial locations involve what we term `` missionary calls '' by one of_this division 's industrial promotion specialists . 
these consist_of visits , without previous announcement , on top officials of manufacturing concerns located in highly industrialized areas . 
more_than 25 carefully selected cities were visit , include new_york , brooklyn , long_island city , newark , elizabeth , stamford , waterbury , new_haven , bridgeport , boston , cambridge , worcester , and waltham . 
out of a total of 603 calls , 452 contacts were establish with top_executive personnel . 
we receive 76 out-of-state visitors interested in investigate rhode_island 's industrial advantages , and industrial_division personnel make 55 out-of-state follow-up visits . 
during 1960 , two important conferences were organize by the development_council 's industrial_division . 
in june , the office of foreign and domestic commerce - in conjunction with local trade associations , chambers_of_commerce , and bank officials - sponsor a world_trade_conference at the sheraton-biltmore_hotel . 
its purpose be to find ways of offset the united_states ' declining balance_of_trade for 1958 and 1959 . 
approximately 100 representatives of business attend this conclave and the r._i._export_conference_committee later vote to continue the activity as an annual event . 
on october 8 th of last year , the industrial_division sponsor the governor 's conference on industrial_development at the former henry_barnard_school . 
a comprehensive program devoted_to the various phases of the development effort attract 143 interested individuals .

workshop sessions in the afternoon feature development executives from pennsylvania , connecticut and maine , and round_out a rewarding program . 
in connection with this conference , a 64 - page supplement was publish in the october 2 nd edition of the providence_sunday_journal . 
devoted_to the improvement in business climate and increase in industrial construction in rhode_island , it has prove a valuable mailing piece for this division . 
more_than 2000 copies have been send_out to prospective clients . 
other special mailings by the industrial_division include copies of speeches deliver at the governor 's conference , letters and brochures to conferees at med-chemical_symposium at university of rhode_island and letters and reprints of industrial advertisements to such organizations as society of industrial realtors .

additional promotional activities include organize the dedication program for operation_turnkey , the new automated post_office , and a conference with representatives of brown_university , providence_college , and university of rhode_island , and eight electronics concerns regarding the inauguration of a training_program for electronics personnel . 
state in its simplest terms , the main job of the planning_division be to plan for the future of the state of rhode_island . 
the activities of the planning_division are define in considerable detail in the enabling_act of the development_council , which assign to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties in the field of planning . 
two years ago , the institute of public_administration issue an extremely comprehensive report entitled `` state-local relations in metropolitan rhode_island . 
as the result of an exhaustive review of the recommendations contain in_this report , plus an analysis of our own enabling_act , the planning_division develop a_number_of basic planning objectives which cause a reorientation of its work program . 
these objectives are state here because of their importance in understand the current activities of the planning_division . 
first priority will be give to the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background for all other planning activities in the state . 
recognize the truth of the statement by the institute of public_administration that `` metropolian_planning ( in rhode_island ) mean , or should mean , state planning '' , the state guide plan will take_into_account the metropolitan nature of many_of rhode_island 's problems . 
it will continue to be an objective of_this division to encourage the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility of local_government . 
to this end , the community assistance program of the planning division will continue to be operate as a staff function to make available , on a shared cost basis , technical planning assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their own planning staff . 
the planning division will take the initiative in encourage planning cooperation at_all levels of government ; among the operating departments of the state ; between the cities and towns of the state ; and on a regional basis between the six new_england states . 
on the basis that all citizens of the state are entitle to benefit equally in the development of its resources , plans for the provision of essential services ( such_as water ) will be base on need regardless_of arbitrary political boundaries , within the framework of the state plan . 
the state development budget will reflect the capital needs of all the state agencies and the priority of the projects in the budget will be base on the state plan . 
in prepare the state guide plan , particular attention will be give means of strengthen the economy of the state through the development of industry and recreation . 
functionally the planning division carry_out four activities : long-range state planning , current state planning , local planning assistance ; and the preparation of the state development budget . 
the planning division has embark_on the_most complete and comprehensive state planning program in the nation . 
the long range aspects of_this program are divide into four distinct phases : basic mapping , inventory , analysis and plan and policy formation . 
the work program , as it was originally propose , be to take five years to complete . 
recent events - particularly the necessity of provide planning information for the statewide origin / destination study of the department of public_works - indicate that this schedule will have to be accelerate . 
the basic mapping phase of the program has been complete and the inventory phase is schedule for completion july_1 , 1961 . 
since accurate base maps be necessary for any planning program , the first_step take by the planning division to implement the long range state plan has be to prepare two series of base maps - one at a scale of 1 inch to a mile , and the second a series of 26 sheets at a scale of 1 inch to 2000 feet , cover the entire state . 
with these maps completed , the inventory phase of the plan has been start . 
with the aid of matching federal funds available under section 701 of the housing_act of 1954 as amended , the planning division begin a one year program july_1 , 1960 to complete the inventory phase of the state planning program . 
this phase consist_of four items : 
urban land use , rural land use , physical features and public_utility service_areas . 
since the validity of all subsequent planning depend_on the accuracy of the basic inventory information , great_care is being take_care that the inventory be as complete as possible . 
the urban land use study carry_out by the planning division staff has consist_of identify and map all urban land uses which be of significance to statewide planning . 
the rural land use study is being carry_out under contract by the university of rhode_island and identify all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use . 
the mapping of important physical features such_as slopes and types of soil and the collection of all available information pertain to public_utility service_areas are being conduct as staff projects and , like the other two inventory projects , are schedule for completion july_1 , 1961 . 
the collection of information be meaningless unless it is understand and use for a definite purpose . 
it be not within the scope of_this report elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in rhode_island . 
however , a word should be mention in regard_to them as independent units of government . 
there be forty-seven special district governments in rhode_island ( exclude two regional school districts , four housing authorities , and the kent_county_water_authority ) . 
these forty-seven special purpose governments have the authority to levy taxes , to borrow money , own property , sue and be sue , and in_general to exercise normal corporate powers . 
unlike cities and towns , however , they do not have to submit any financial_statements to the state bureau of audits . 
it be not an exaggeration to say that the state_government have little or no fiscal control over these units of government . 
in_addition to the collection of service_charges , the special districts levy annual property_taxes of approximately $ 450000 . 
a review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity be pertinent to this report . 
include in the findings be : 
forty-six states , include rhode_island , end their fiscal_year on june 30 . 
the other four states end on varying dates : alabama ( sept. 30 ) , new_york ( march 31 ) , pennsylvania ( may 31 ) , and texas ( august 31 ) . 
in sixteen states , the fiscal_year ending of the cities ( june 30 ) be the same as that of the state : 
alaska , arizona , california , delaware , massachusetts , montana , nevada , new_mexico , north_carolina , north_dakota , oklahoma , oregon , vermont , west_virginia , wyoming , and hawaii ) . 
in eleven states , the fiscal_year of the cities end on december 31 , while the state fiscal_year end on june 30 ( arkansas , colorado , indiana , kansas , new_hampshire , new_jersey , ohio , south_dakota , utah , washington , and wisconsin ) . 
in eight states whose fiscal_years close on june 30 , a majority of their cities close their fiscal_year on december 31 : ( georgia , iowa , kentucky , maine , maryland , minnesota , virginia , and south_carolina ) . 
one state , alabama , close its fiscal_year on september 30 , and all cities in the state , with one exception , also close fiscal_years on september 30 . 
mississippi close its fiscal_year on june 30 , while all_of its cities close their fiscal_years on september 30 . 
pennsylvania close its fiscal_year on may 31 . 
all_of its cities close their fiscal_years on december 31 . 
the remaining twelve states have varying fiscal_years for the state , city and local_governments . 
however , only illinois , oregon , louisiana and rhode_island have a situation in_which the sundry units of government vary widely in_relation_to fiscal uniformity . 
an excellent summary of advantages concern the uniform fiscal_year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contain in a paper present by a public finance authority recently . 
he list among the values of fiscal uniformity : 
the uniform fiscal_year require compliance with common_sense administration of local finances : adoption of the budget , or financial plan , in_advance of spending . 
the uniform fiscal_year ensure conformance with another common_sense rule , that of have cash in the bank before checks are draw . 
it enable towns to make more economical purchases and to take_advantage of cash discounts . 
the uniform fiscal_year promote more careful budgeting and strengthen control over expenditures . 
by fix the tax_rate in_advance of spending , upper_limits are set on expenditures . 
the uniform fiscal_year bring the town 's fiscal_year into line with_that of the schools , which expend the largest share of local disbursements . 
this greatly simplify the town 's bookkeeping and financial reporting . 
the uniform fiscal_year eliminate interest charges on money borrow in the form of tax anticipation notes . 
furthermore , tax_collections not immediately need for current expenditures may be invest in short-term treasury_notes , augment the town 's miscellaneous revenues and reduce the tax levy . 
the uniform fiscal_year facilitate inter-town comparison of revenues and expenditures . 
when towns have the same fiscal_year it be relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons ; and as the cost of local_government increase , the demand for such comparison also increase . 
towns have different fiscal_years be difficult to compare . 
of all advantages , probably none be more important than the elimination of tax anticipation notes . 
borrow in anticipation of current taxes and other revenues be a routine procedure of the majority of municipalities at_all_times . 
it may be by bank loans , sale of notes or warrants , or by the somewhat casual method of issuance and registration of warrants . 
in_any_event it be a form of borrowing which could be and should be render unnecessary . 
its elimination would result in the saving of interest costs , heavy when short-term money rates be high , and in freedom from dependence on credit which be not always available when need most . 
this type of borrowing can be reduce to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is institute and the first payment place near the opening of the fiscal_year . 
any approach toward such a system look toward saving and security . 
it should be note that there are other and equally important reasons for establish meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform fiscal_year . 
both the federal and state_governments commence their fiscal_years on july_1 . 
both units of government contribute increasingly large sums_of_money to the several local_governments in_this state as indicate below : 
it has been say that when local_government revenues were mostly produce locally from the property_tax , the lack of a uniform fiscal_year be no great handicap ; but with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid , the emphasis on equalization , and the state-local sharing of responsibility for_certain important functions , this be no_longer true . 
the haphazard fiscal_year calendar be an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient state-local revenue and expenditure relationships . 
although there are many sound reasons for adopt uniform and coordinated fiscal_years in rhode_island , there are also certain difficulties encounter . 
these involve more the mechanics employ in adjust to fiscal uniformity than they do actual actual disadvantages to the principle . 
one problem be a matter of shift dates ; the other , be how to finance the transition . 
little can be do about the changing of dates . 
this be an inherent part of adjust fiscal calendars . 
it usually mean a confused and disgruntled tax-paying public for a period_of_time . 
but cooperation and understanding between local officials and the citizenry help lessen this problem . 
the other problem be the_matter of finance the transition period in the several cities and towns . 
this will be cover more fully later . 
it should be keep in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the proposed plan be directly dependent upon the financial_condition of_that town or city . 
fortunately , there are no cities or towns in the state , with one or two possible exceptions that be in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change . 
sacrifice will have to be make in some cases , but it be to the municipality 's advantage to finance the change-over for a short period_of_time rather_than pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely . 
the advantages of a uniform fiscal_year and well synchronized fiscal and tax_collection calendars be sufficiently great for rhode_island municipalities to exert effort to secure them . 
the type of program desire can be determine by the nature and extent of the adjustments need . 
two features be immediately evident . 
first , the present situation be too varied to be systematize by any single formula . 
second , the shift to a uniform july_1 - june 30 fiscal_year will , of itself , improve the tax_collection calendars of the great majority of cities and towns . 
there are at_least two problems to consider : one be a matter of adjust the fiscal calendar ; the other be how to finance the adjustments when necessary . 
the latter matter is consider in_detail in a later section . 
twelve cities and towns in rhode_island presently indicate some plans to establish a uniform and / or coordinated fiscal-tax year calendar . 
plans vary from the `` talking stage '' to establish special committees to accomplish this end . 
what be important here be that many_of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are take the initiative to obtain them . 
an analysis of the fiscal-tax collection year calendars throughout the state indicate that transition may not be as painful as is commonly think . 
however , it must be stress that_much depend_upon the financial_condition of the individual cities and towns involved . 
the adjustments need to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal-tax collection year calendar throughout rhode_island , base on a july_1 - june 30 year , are show below . 
six cities and towns be presently on a july_1 - june 30 fiscal_year and have coordinate their tax_collection year with_it . 
no change is require for these towns . 
these municipalities include : barrington , lincoln , middletown , newport , north_kingstown , and south_kingstown . 
one town and one city , coventry and east_providence , require an adjustment of their fiscal_year only . 
this change will automatically adjust their tax_collection year calendar so_as_to make all tax installments due and payable in the fiscal_year collectible within that year . 
six cities and towns be now on a july_1 - june 30 fiscal_year and will need only to adjust their tax_collection year calendar to establish uniformity . 
these cities and towns include bristol , glocester , pawtucket , cumberland , central_falls , and woonsocket . 
two cities to be consider , providence and cranston , be an enigma . 
both have excellent integration of their fiscal-tax collection year calendars . 
however , neither of these two cities be on the desired july_1 - june 30 fiscal_year . 
the adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal period could be accomplish relatively easy for them . 
in_that both cities end their fiscal_years on september 30 , they could levy taxes for an interim period of nine months , commence with september 30 and end with june 30 . 
these three installment dates would be : 
october 26 , january 26 , and april 25 ( providence ) and november 15 , february 16 and may 15 ( cranston ) . 
both would start their new fiscal_year on july_1 . 
their tax_collection calendar could then be : july 25 , october 26 , january 26 , and april 25 , ( providence ) ; and august 15 , november 15 , february 17 , and may 15 , ( cranston ) . 
under this plan both cranston and providence would be on the uniform fiscal_year but would still be use the same installment periods . 
the remaining twenty-three towns have fiscal_years which end prior to june 30 . 
all_of these towns will require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax_collection years . 
assume an adjustment to the july_1 - june 30 fiscal_year , the required adjustment of the tax_collection years and the towns involve are show in table 3 . 
aside from the_matter of adjust the fiscal and tax calendars , there is the problem of finance the adjustment when this be necessary . 
it should be emphasize strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets do not necessarily mean finance over and above normal governmental requirements . 
in many communities there is simply no financial problem ; it be only a matter of adjust accounting methods , careful fiscal planning and management , or some like combination of techniques . 
in other municipalities the difficulties in overcome the financial burden have be sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of fiscal_year changes . 
fortunately , such cases in rhode_island be more the exception than the rule . 
as show earlier in table 1 , the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax_collection calendars . 
in_addition , no two rhode_island communities be identical in_relation_to their over-all financial_condition . 
these factors practically insure that no single financing formula be feasible ; each situation must be study and a plan develop that take into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax calendars , the financial_condition of the treasuries , and the length of the transition interval . 
suitable plans range from those that be very easy to develop to those that be difficult to formulate and require borrowing range from short-term serial notes to long-term bonds . 
the financial problem , where it exist , usually stem from the adoption of a budget for the transitional or adjustment period . 
for those communities which have financial difficulties in effect adjustments , there are a_number_of alternatives any one of_which alone , or in combination with others , would minimize if_not even eliminate the problem . 
the theme of rhode_island heritage_week for 1961 will be `` independence and union '' . 
it commemorate the 185 th anniversary of rhode_island 's independence when , upon may 4 , 1776 , the general_assembly , by its action , establish the first free republic in the new_world . 
as this year mark the centennial of the beginning of the civil_war , this fact is being commemorate with several exhibits throughout the state , but most_of_all pay tribute to the first rhode_island volunteers who rush to the defense of the city of washington , put at the disposal of president_lincoln the only fully equipped and best trained regiment at this time .

the ballet originate_in italy about 1450 . 
at_that_time it be a series of sophisticated social dances whose steps were often combine with other steps devise by the choreographer . 
ballet flower in italy during the next hundred years , and about 1550 was carry to france when the italian princess , catherine de medicis , marry the king of france . 
the_most famous ballet of_that time be called ballet_comique de la reine ( 1581 ) . 
dances alternate with sung or spoken verses . 
ballets were use in opera from its beginning . 
they were place either in_the_middle of the acts or in the intermissions . 
the state_ballet of rhode_island , the first incorporated group , was form for_the_purpose_of extend knowledge of the art of ballet in the community , to promote interest in ballet performances , to contribute to the cultural life of the state , and to provide opportunity for gifted dance students who , for one reason or another , be unable to pursue a career and to develop others for the professional state ; and now , therefore , do i , john_a._notte , jr. , governor of the state of rhode_island and providence plantations , proclaim the week of monday , november 13 , 1961 , as the state_ballet of rhode_island week , request all rhode_islanders to give special attention to this unusual event which should contribute to the cultural life of the state . 
in testimony whereof , i have hereunto set my hand and cause the seal of the state to be affix this 23 d day of october , in the year of our lord , one_thousand nine hundred and sixty-one , and of independence , the one_hundred and eighty-sixth . 
governor . 
as another thanksgiving draw_near , let us take time_out from the often hectic pace of our lives to try and recapture the feelings that fill the hearts of the pilgrims on the first thanksgiving . 
the pilgrims gather to thank the lord for his benevolence during their first year in the new land . 
they had be through trying times , but their faith in the almighty had give them the courage and the strength to meet and overcome the many problems and difficulties that be the price they have to pay for freedom . 
and as the pilgrims bow their heads in humble gratitude , they share another feeling - the anticipation of_what the future held for them and their posterity . 
they could not guess that from their concepts of liberty and freedom would some_day be_born a new nation that for years would be the symbol of hope to the oppressed countries of the world . 
they simply turn_to god filled with gratitude and faith . 
we who are live today may learn a valuable lesson from those who celebrate the first thanksgiving_day . 
the lord has show time_and_time_again his love for us . 
we have only to compare the liberty and high standard_of_living we enjoy in_this great country with the oppression and frugality of other nations to realize with humble gratitude that god 's providence has be with us since the very beginning of our country . 
and yet , accompany our gratitude be the realization that we are live in a crucial time . 
with world peace constantly being threaten , most_of us regard the future skeptically , and even with fear . 
it be at this time that we should imitate the pilgrims by accompany our prayers of thanks with the conviction that we shall continue to be in dire need for the lord 's protection in_the_future , if we be to have peace ; now , therefore , do i , john_a._notte , jr. , governor of the state of rhode_island and providence plantations , proclaim thursday , november 23 rd , 1961 , as thanksgiving_day , 
and so , let us remember on_this_day not_only to thank the almighty who give hope and courage to the pilgrims , but also to place our trust in him that he will continue to protect us in_the_future as he has in_the_past . 
in testimony whereof , i have hereunto set my hand and cause the seal of the state to be affix this 21 st day of november , in the year of our lord , one_thousand nine hundred and sixty-one and of independence , the one_hundred and eighty-sixth .

in the same period , 431 presentations by members of the staff were make to local , national , and international medical groups . 
the education function of the institute is carry_on by the staff in the departments of pathology and its consultants . 
during fiscal_year 1959 , six courses were conduct : forensic_pathology , application of histochemistry to pathology , pathology of diseases of laboratory animals , opthalmic_pathology , pathology of the oral regions , and a cardiovasculatory_pathology_seminar . 
during fiscal_year 1960 , seven courses were conduct : application of histochemistry to pathology , forensic_pathology , pathology of diseases of laboratory animals , pathology of the oral regions , opthalmic_pathology , forensic sciences symposium , and orthopedic_pathology . 
from 1 july 1960 through 31 january 1961 , six courses were conduct : workshop in resident_training in pathology , pathology of diseases of laboratory animals , application of histochemistry of pathology , orthopedic_pathology , forensic sciences symposium , and forensic_pathology . 
during fiscal_years 1959 and 1960 , there be 139 military and civilian students who come to the institute for varying periods of special instruction . 
the institute be engaged in an extensive program of medico-military scientific research in both morphological and experimental pathology . 
among the specific areas of concentration in_which the staff be engaged , be such projects as biological and biochemical studies of the effects of microwaves ; study of motor end plates in man and animals ; investigation of respiratory_diseases of laboratory animals ; metabolic responses to reduced oxygen tension ; neuropathology of nuclear and cosmic radiation ; carcinoma of prostate ; evaluation of histochemical techniques ; and hip dysplasia in dogs . 
there has be an increase in cooperative research with other federal agencies and civilian institutions . 
during the period from 1 july 1960 through 31 january 1961 , additional research affiliations were effect with the u._s._army_medical_research and development_command to conduct research in procedures for quantitative electron_microscopy , and for the study of biophysical and biological studies of the structure and function of ocular tissue . 
also , the defense_atomic_support_agency sponsor a long-range study at this institute on the response of massive suspension cultures of mammalian cells to acute radiation . 
other scientific agencies , both federal and civilian , support studies in quantitative electron microscopical approach to microchemistry and microcytochemistry ; the investigation of the relationship of diphosphopyridine nucleotide synthesizine enzyme to tumor growth ; morphological study and classification of leukemia and lymphoma cases in animals ; and the study of structural changes in m. leprae and other mycobacteria . 
the medical_illustration_service be responsible_for the collection , publication , exhibition , and file of medical illustration material of medico-military importance to the armed_forces . 
in_addition to maintain a permanent central file of illustrations of diseases , wounds , and injuries of military importance , it provide facilities for clinical photography , photomicrography , and medical arts , and operate a printing plant , by permission of congressional_committee , for publication of an `` atlas of tumor_pathology '' . 
it also maintain shops for the design and fabrication of exhibits , training aids and instruments and libraries for the loan of films and teaching lantern_slide sets . 
during this period , a total of 762 exhibits were present at 442 medical and scientific meetings . 
of these exhibits , 154 were newly construct . 
twenty-nine exhibits receive awards . 
visual and operable training aids develop by the medical_illustration_service , were use in support of army_medical_service mass casualty exercises . 
members of the medical_illustration_service lecture and conduct demonstrations on the use of training aids to military_personnel and various civilian medical organizations . 
demonstrations of new and projected training aids were conduct at the medical_service_instructor 's conference , brooke_army medical_center , texas . 
in support of the emphasis place by the department_of_defense on instruction in emergency medical_care , the medical_illustration_service develop casualty simulation kits and rescue breathing manikins which are being field-test ; and overhead_projector transparency sets on the subjects of military_sanitation : first_aid for soldiers ; bandaging and splinting ; the emergency_medical_treatment unit , phase 1 , ; and emergency_war_surgery in support of the north_atlantic_treaty_organization ( nato ) handbook . 
fifty lantern_slide teaching sets on the subject of `` emergency_war_surgery ( nato ) '' were assemble and distribute to the medical military_services of foreign governments associated with nato and south-east_asia_treaty_organization . 
the_british and canadian liaison officers , as_well as office of civil and defense_mobilization , the american red_cross , and similar interested organizations were inform from_time_to_time as training aids were develop . 
nine veterinary lantern_slide teaching sets were develop and distribute , and lantern_slide teaching sets on 21 pathology subjects were add to the loan library of the medical_illustration_service . 
illustrations were prepare for 11 department of the army manuals and one graphic_training_aid . 
sixteen lantern_slide sets were loan to the government of india and eight sets were forward to the u._s._embassy , managua , nicaragua for the educational_exchange program . 
the senate_subcommittee on reorganization and international_organizations was provide samples of visual aids on first_aid and personal health produce by the medical_illustration_service . 
six fascicles ( 10000 copies each ) of the `` atlas of tumor_pathology '' were complete during the period of_this report . 
this consist_of 25 individual registries , two of_which were add during fiscal_years 1959 - 1960 ( the registry of forensic_pathology and the testicular_tumor_registry ) . 
these registries are sponsor by 18 national medical , dental , and veterinary societies and have as their mission the assembling of selected cases of interest to military medicine and of establish through the mechanism of follow-up of living patients the natural_history of various diseases of military-medical importance . 
the american_registry of pathology operate as a cooperative enterprise in medical research and education between the armed_forces institute of pathology and the civilian medical_profession on a national and international basis , under such conditions as may be agree upon between the national_research_council and the surgeons_general of the army , navy , and air_force . 
the staff utilize the collected material in these registries for numerous lectures to national and international meetings , exhibits , and published studies . 
during the period of_this report , 37470 new cases were enter into the various registries . 
these were select carefully and include not_only detailed clinical information but adequate pathology of value for research and educational purposes . 
in_this same period , six new fascicles of the atlas of tumor_pathology were publish and distribute to medical_centers world-wide . 
there were 54320 copies of fascicles sell and 642 copies distribute free during this period . 
forty-five new clinico-pathologic conferences were prepare , bring the total to 61 available for loan distribution . 
nine new teaching clinico-pathologic_conference sets were prepare , which make a total of 70 types of teaching sets for loan . 
during this period , 7827 teaching sets were distribute on loan . 
the clinico-pathologic conferences have been acknowledge as of great value and in consequent great demand by the small isolated military_hospitals . 
the demand for teaching sets continue unabated since they provide the means for the military physicians to review the pathology of selected disease processes or organ systems for review of basic sciences and correlation of clinical physiological behavior with structural changes . 
in fiscal_year 1959 , the medical_museum was move to chase_hall , a temporary building on independence_avenue at ninth_street , southwest , and continue to display to the public the achievements of the armed_forces medical services . 
during the period of_this report , 63 panel exhibits depict the latest developments in medical research were display . 
of the 375 exhibits ( of all types ) show , 161 be new or refurbished . 
of the 885 specimens newly mount or refurbish , 254 were prepare for other agencies . 
eighty-five specimens were loan for study purposes . 
an exhibit , `` macropathology - an ancient art , a new science '' , was present at the annual meeting of the american_medical_association . 
a three-dimensional exhibit depict `` a century of naval_medicine '' was formally present to the director by george_s._squibb , great-grandson of the founder of e._r._squibb and sons , for permanent display in the museum . 
space was provide for short-time guest medical exhibits , and the museum collect new accessions of microscopes , medical , surgical , and diagnostic instruments , uniform , and similar items of historical medico-military significance . 
during the period , the laboratory render centralized macropathological service to qualified requesters . 
specimens were mount for military_installations , governmental agencies , and medical_schools . 
three hundred five copies of the manual of macropathological techniques were distribute . 
thirty-five military and civilian students receive laboratory training . 
during fiscal_years 1959 and 1960 , there be 795586 visitors to the museum . 
during the period from 1 july 1960 through 31 january 1961 , the medical_museum was require to move to temporary building `` s '' on the mall from chase_hall . 
throughout the period and during the movement operation , the museum continue its functional support of the armed_forces institute of pathology . 
the armed_forces medical publication agency , establish in 1949 , has publish , since january 1950 , the united_states armed_forces medical_journal as a triservice publication to furnish material of professional interest to medical_department officers of the three military_services . 
its supplement , the medical technicians bulletin , supply similar material_to enlisted medical personnel . 
these publications replace the u._s._naval_medical_bulletin , publish continuously from 1907 through 1959 , as_well_as the navy 's hospital_corps quarterly and the bulletin of the u._s._army_medical_department , publish from 1922 to 1949 . 
in_addition , their establishment make it unnecessary to begin publication of a contemplated air_force medical bulletin . 
estimated annual savings result from publication of the journal and bulletin on a triservice basis , as compare with the cost of produce separate periodicals for each service , be between $ 65000 and $ 70000 . 
additionally , on the many ships at_sea and in the smaller naval stations , the availability of the journal remove the necessity of subscribe_to several additional journals of civilian origin over and above the quantity now authorized , in_order_to provide any reasonably comparable coverage . 
from 1 july 1958 to 30 june 1960 , 24 numbers of the journal and nine of the bulletin were publish . 
each journal contain articles of professional and clinical interest , and departments devote to military medical news , reviews of new books , and other features of interest to officers of the medical services . 
the council on national_defense of the american_medical_association contribute a brief article to each issue entitled , `` this be your a. m. a . '' . 
begin with the october 1959 issue of the journal , the method of production of copy for photo-offset reproduction was change from varityping to hot typesetting . 
this result in an improved appearance , but was follow by an increase in printing cost that necessitate the institution of major economies to keep within the total of allocated funds . 
the use of 100 instead of 140 substance paper plus the adoption of side stapling begin with the may 1960 issue reduce costs sufficiently to allow completion of the fiscal_year with nearly $ 4000 in unexpended funds . 
two special issues were publish , one for november 1959 on space_medicine , the other the tenth_anniversary issue for january 1960 . 
the february 1960 issue mark the reinstitution of the section entitled , `` the medical_officer_writes '' . 
replace the discontinued medical technicians bulletin , publication of_which was suspend with the november-december 1959 issue , a section called `` technical notes '' was inaugurate on a bimonthly basis begin with the april 1960 issue . 
occasional features were publish on historical medicine , special reports , bibliography , and `` collector 's items '' . 
in may 1960 , the armed_forces institute of pathology begin a series of articles on the `` medical_museum '' , and in june , the institute start contribute a regular monthly `` case for diagnosis '' . 
the institute also plan to furnish a regular series of articles , begin in the fall of 1960 , on its more significant scientific exhibits . 
the armed_forces epidemiological board agree to submit each_month a report for one of its 12 commissions , so_that each commission will report once a year on some phase of its work calculate to be of particular interest and value to medical_officers of the armed_forces . 
the first report in_this continuing series appear in the september 1960 issue of the journal . 
in 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex_numbers . 
these are define by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in_which a general line meet a nonsingular quadric surface bear a curve of symbol * * f . 
then in 2 we show that any line involution with the properties that ( a ) it have no complex of invariant lines , and ( b ) its singular lines form a complex consist_of exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve , be necessarily of the type discuss in 1 . 
no generalization of these results to spaces of more_than three dimensions has so_far been find possible . 
let q be a nonsingular quadric surface bear reguli * * f and * * f , and let \ g be a * * f curve of order k on q . 
a general line l meet q in two points , * * f and * * f , through each of_which pass a unique generator of the regulus , * * f , whose lines be simple secants of \ g . 
on these generators let * * f and * * f be , respectively , the harmonic conjugates of * * f and * * f with_respect_to the two points in_which the corresponding generator meet \ g . 
the line * * f be the image of l . 
clearly , the transformation be involutorial . 
we observe first that no line , l , can meet its image except at one of its intersections with q . 
for if it did , the plane of l and l ' would contain two generators of * * f , which be impossible . 
moreover , from the definitive transformation of intercepts on the generators of * * f , it be clear that the only points of q at which a line can meet its image be the points of \ g . 
hence the totality of singular lines be the kth order complex of lines which meet \ g . 
the invariant lines be the lines of the congruence of secants of \ g , since each of these meet q in two points which be invariant . 
the order of_this congruence be * * f , since * * f secants of a curve of symbol ( a , b ) on a quadric surface pass through an arbitrary point . 
the class of the congruence be * * f , since an arbitrary plane meet \ g in k points . 
since the complex of singular lines be of order k and since there is no complex of invariant lines , it follow from the formula * * f that the order of the involution be * * f . 
there are various sets of exceptional lines , or lines whose images be not unique . 
the_most obvious of these be the quadratic complex of tangents to q , each line of_which is transform into the entire pencil of lines tangent to q at the image of the point of tangency of the given line . 
thus pencils of tangents to q are transform into pencils of tangents . 
it be interesting that a 1 : 1 correspondence can be establish between the lines of two such pencils , so_that in_a_sense a unique image can actually be assign to each tangent . 
for the lines of any plane , | p , meet q in a conic c , are transform into the congruence of secants of the curve c ' into which c is transform in the point involution on q . 
in_particular , tangents to c are transform into tangents to c ' . 
moreover , if * * f and * * f be two planes intersect in a line l , tangent to q at a point p , the two free intersections of the image curves * * f and * * f must coincide at p ' , the image of p , and at this point * * f and * * f must have a common tangent l ' . 
hence , think_of as a line in a particular plane | p , any tangent to q have a unique image and moreover this image be the same for all planes through l . 
each generator , | l , of * * f be also exceptional , for each is transform into the entire congruence of secants of the curve into which that generator is transform by the point involution on q . 
this curve be of symbol * * f since it meet | l , and hence every line of * * f in the * * f invariant points on | l and since it obviously meet every line of * * f in a single point . 
the congruence of its secants be therefore of order * * f and class * * f . 
a final class of exceptional lines be identifiable from the following considerations : since no two generators of * * f can intersect , it follow that their image curves can have no free intersections . 
in_other_words , these curves have only fixed intersections common to them all . 
now the only way in_which all curves of the image family of * * f can pass through a fixed point be to have a generator of * * f which be not a secant but a tangent of \ g , for then any point on such a generator will be transform into the point of tangency . 
since two curves of symbol * * f on q intersect in * * f points , it follow that there are * * f lines of * * f which be tangent to \ g . 
clearly , any line , l , of any bundle have one of these points of tangency , t , as vertex will be transform into the entire pencil have the image of the second intersection of l and q as vertex and lie in the plane determine by the image point and the generator of * * f which be tangent to \ g at t . 
a line through two of these points , * * f and * * f , will be transform into the entire bilinear congruence have the tangents to \ g at * * f and * * f as directrices . 
a conic , c , be a ( 1 , 1 ) curve on q , meet the image of any line of * * f , which we have already find to be a * * f curve on q , in * * f points . 
hence its image , c ' , meet any line of * * f in * * f points . 
moreover , c ' obviously meet any line * * f in a single point . 
hence c ' be a * * f curve on q . 
therefore , the congruence of its secants , that_is the image of a general plane field of lines , be of order * * f and class * * f . 
finally , the image of a general bundle of lines be a congruence whose order be the order of the congruence of invariant lines , namely * * f and whose class be the order of the image congruence of a general plane field of lines , namely * * f . 
the preceding observations make it clear that there exist line involutions of all orders greater than 1 with no complex of invariant lines and with a complex of singular lines consist_of exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve \ g . 
we now shall show that any involution with these characteristics be necessarily of the type we have just describe . 
to do this we must first show that every line which meet \ g in a point p meet its image at p . 
to see this , consider a general pencil of lines contain a general secant of \ g . 
by ( 1 ) , the image of_this pencil be a ruled surface of order * * f which is meet by the plane of the pencil in a curve , c , of order * * f . 
on c there be a * * f correspondence in_which the * * f points cut from c by a general line , l , of the pencil correspond to the point_of_intersection of the image of l and the plane of the pencil . 
since c be rational , this correspondence have k coincidences , each of_which imply a line of the pencil which meet its image . 
however , since the pencil contain a secant of \ g it actually contain only * * f singular lines . 
to avoid this contradiction it be necessary that c be composite , with the secant of \ g and a curve of order * * f as components . 
thus it follow that the secants of \ g be all invariant . 
but if this be the case , then an arbitrary pencil of lines have a point , p , of \ g as vertex is transform into a ruled surface of order * * f have * * f generators concurrent at p . 
since a ruled surface of order n with n concurrent generators be necessarily a cone , it follow finally that every line through a point , p , of \ g meet its image at p , as assert . 
now consider the transformation of the lines of a bundle with vertex , p , on \ g which is effect by the involution as_a_whole . 
from the preceding remarks , it be clear that such a bundle is transform into itself in an involutorial fashion . 
moreover , in_this involution there be a cone of invariant lines of order * * f , namely the cone of secants of \ g which pass through p . 
hence it follow that the involution within the bundle must be a perspective de jonquieres involution of order * * f and the invariant locus must have a multiple line of multiplicity either * * f or * * f . 
the first possibility require that there be a line through p which meet \ g in * * f points ; the second require that there be a line through p which meet \ g in * * f points . 
in each case , lines of the bundles are transform by involutions within the pencils they determine with the multiple secant . 
in the first case the fixed elements within each pencil be the multiple secant and the line join the vertex , p , to the intersection of \ g and the plane of the pencil which does not lie on the multiple secant . 
in the second , the fixed elements be the lines which join the vertex , p , to the two intersections of \ g and the plane of the pencil which do not lie on the multiple secant . 
the multiple secants , of_course , be exceptional and in each case are transform into cones of order * * f . 
observations similar to these can be make at each point of \ g . 
hence \ g must have either a regulus of * * f-fold secants or a regulus of * * f-fold secants . 
moreover , if * * f , no two of the multiple secants can intersect . 
for if such be the case , either the plane of the two lines would meet \ g in more_than k points or , alternatively , the order of the image regulus of the pencil determine by the two lines would be too high . 
but if no two lines of the regulus of multiple secants of \ g can intersect , then the regulus must be quadratic , or in_other_words , \ g must be either a * * f or a * * f curve on a nonsingular quadric surface . 
we now observe that the case in_which \ g be a * * f curve on a quadric be impossible if the complex of singular lines consist_of exclusively of the lines which meet \ g . 
for any pencil in a plane contain a * * f-fold secant of \ g have an image regulus which meet the plane of the pencil in * * f lines , namely the images of the lines of the pencil which pass through the intersection of \ g and the multiple secant , plus an additional component to account_for the intersections of the images of the general lines of the pencil . 
however , if there is no additional complex of singular lines , the order of the image regulus of a pencil be precisely * * f . 
this contradict the preceding observations , and so , under the assumption of_this paper we must reject the possibility that \ g be a * * f curve on a quadric surface . 
continue with the case in_which \ g be a * * f curve on a quadric q , we first observe that the second regulus of q consist_of precisely of the lines which join the two free intersections of \ g and the planes through any one of the multiple secants . 
for each of these lines meet q in three points , namely two points on \ g and one point on one of the multiple secants . 
now consider an arbitrary line , l , meet q in two points , * * f and * * f . 
if | a be the multiple secant of \ g which pass through * * f and | b be the simple secant of \ g which pass through * * f , and if * * f be the points in_which | a meet \ g , and if * * f be the image of * * f on the generator | b , it follow that the image of the line * * f be * * f . 
overwhelmed with the care of five young children and concerned about persistent economic difficulties due_to her husband 's marginal income , her defense of denial be excessively strong . 
thus the lack of effective recognition of the responsibilities involved in care for two babies show signs of become a disabling problem . 
the result , dramatically visible in a matter of days in the family 's disrupted daily functioning , be a phobic-like fear that some terrible harm would befall the second twin , whose birth had not been anticipate . 
soon mrs._b . 's fears threaten to burst into a full-blown panic concerning the welfare of the entire family . 
inability to care for the other children , difficulty in feed the babies , who seem colicky , bone-weary fatigue , repeated crying episodes , and short_tempers reflect the family 's helplessness in cope_with the stressful situation . 
clearly , this be a family in crisis . 
mrs._b. compare her feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and helplessness at_the_time of her mother 's death when she be eight , as_well as her subsequent anger at her father for remarry . 
her previous traumatic experiences flash through her mind as if they had happen yesterday . 
on the anniversary of her father 's death she pour_out with agonized tears her feelings of guilt about not having attend his funeral . 
in the family 's own words ( during the third of twelve visits ) , they had `` reach the crisis peak - either the situation will give or we will break '' ! 
direct confrontation and acceptance of mrs._b . 's anger against the second baby soon dissipate her fears of annihilation . 
abreaction of her anxiety and guilt concerning the death of her parents , when link up with her current feelings of anger and her fears of loss , abandonment , and annihilation , produce further relief of tension . 
in a joint interview mr. and mrs._b. were help to understand the meaning of a younger son 's wander away_from_home in_terms_of his feelings of displacement in reaction to the arrival of the twins . 
the father , accurately perceive the child 's needs , not_only respect them as worthy of his attention , but immediately satisfy them by take him on his lap along with the twins , say , `` i have a big lap ; there is room for you , too , johnnie '' . 
simultaneously , a variety of environmental supports - a calm but not too motherly homemaker , referral for temporary economic aid , intelligent use of nursing_care , accompaniment to the well-baby clinic for medical advice on the twins ' feeding problem - combine to prevent further development of predictable pathological mechanisms . 
follow-up visits of the nurse and social_worker indicate continued success in the care of the new babies as_well as a marked improvement in the family 's day-to-day mental_health and social functioning . 
as see in the b. family , there must be an attempt to help the client develop conscious awareness of the problem , especially in the absence of a formal request for assistance . 
the lack of awareness usually spring from deep but disguised anxiety , often assume the superficial guise of `` not know '' or `` not care '' . 
the unhealthy use of denial in the initial reaction to a stress must be handle through the medium of a positive controlled transference . 
in_general , the approach be more active than passive , more out-reaching than reflective . 
while some regression be inevitable , it is discourage rather_than encourage so_that the transference does not follow the stages of planned regression associated with certain casework adaptations of the psychoanalytic model for insight therapy . 
to establish an emotionally meaningful relationship the worker must demonstrate actual or potential helpfulness immediately , preferably within the first interview , by meet the client 's specific needs . 
these needs usually concern the reduction of guilt and some relief of tension . 
the initial interview must be therapeutic rather_than purely exploratory in an information-seekingsense . 
in_this relationship-building stage the worker must communicate confidence in the client 's ability to deal with the problem . 
in so doing he implicitly offer the positive contagion of hope as a kind_of maturational dynamic to counteract feelings of helplessness and hopelessness generally associated with the first stages of stress impact . 
thus , the client receive enough ego support to engage in constructive efforts on_his_own behalf . 
here there is a specific preventive component which apply in a more generalized sense to any casework situation . 
we are prevent or avert pathogenic phenomena such_as undue regression , unhealthy suppression and repression , excessive use of denial , and crippling guilt turn against the self . 
while some suppression and some denial be not_only necessary but healthy , the worker 's clinical knowledge must determine how these defenses are being use , what healthy shifts in defensive adaptation are indicate , and when efforts at bring_about change can be most effectively time . 
in steer the family toward ego-adaptive and away from maladaptive responses , the worker use time-honored focused casework techniques of specific emotional support , clarification , and anticipatory guidance . 
over a relatively short period_of_time , usually about four to twelve weeks , the worker must be able to shift the focus , back_and_forth , between immediate external stressful exigencies ( `` precipitating stress '' ) and the key , emotionally relevant issues ( `` underlying problem '' ) which are , often in a dramatic preconscious breakthrough , reactivate by the crisis situation , and hence once_again amenable to resolution . 
though there be obviously nothing new about these techniques , they do challenge the worker 's skill to articulate them precisely on_the_spot and on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic assessments . 
then , too , the utmost clinical flexibility be necessary in judiciously combine carefully timed family-oriented home visits , single and group office interviews , and appropriate telephone follow-up calls , if the worker is to be genuinely accessible and if the predicted unhealthy outcome is to be actually avert in_accordance_with the principles of preventive intervention . 
in_addition , in many cases , a variety of concrete social resources - homemaker , day_care , medical and financial_aid - must be reasonably available for the reality support needed to bolster the family in its individual and collective coping and integrative efforts . 
at certain critical stages , and only for sound diagnostic reasons , it may be important to accompany family members in their use of these resources if their problem-solving behavior is to be constructive rather_than defeating . 
while expensive in_time and involve a great_deal of adaptation on the part of the worker ( in_terms_of his willingness to leave the sanctity of his office and enter actively into the client 's life ) , techniques of accompaniment were find to be of tremendous value when in the service of specific preventive objectives . 
finally , whatever the techniques use , a twin goal be common to all preventive casework service : to cushion or reduce the force of the stress impact while at_the_same_time to encourage and support family members to mobilize and use their ego capacities . 
having outline an approach to the theory and practice of preventive casework , we now address ourselves to our final question : what place should brief , crisis-oriented preventive casework occupy in our total spectrum of services ? 
we should first recognize our tendency to develop a hierarchy of values , locate brief treatment at the bottom and long-term intensive service at the top , instead of see the services as part of a continuum , each important in its own right . 
this problem be perhaps as old as social casework itself . 
almost three decades ago bertha_reynolds undertake a study of short-contact interviewing because of her conviction that short-term casework have an important but neglected place in our network of social_services . 
her conclusion has been bear_out in the experience of many practitioners : 
`` short-contact interviewing be neither a truncated nor a telescoped experience but be of the same essential quality as the so-called intensive case work '' . 
thus , casework involve a limited number of interviews is still to be regard in_terms_of the quality of service render rather_than of the quantity of time expend . 
that we are experience an upsurge of interest in the many formulations and preventive adaptations of brief treatment in social casework be evident from even a small sampling of current literature . 
especially noteworthy be levinger 's finding that the length of treatment per_se be not a reliable indicator of successful outcome . 
according to a_number_of studies , the important predictors be the nature and management of the client 's anxiety as_well as the accessibility of the helping person . 
for_example , the level of improvement note in a recent experiment with a short course of immediate treatment for parent-child relationship problems compare favorably with the results report by typical child guidance clinics where the hours spend in purely diagnostic study may equal or exceed the number of hours devote to actual treatment interviews in the experimental project . 
of startling significance , too , be the assertion that it be possible to carry_out this program with only a 6 percent attrition_rate as compare with a rate of 59 percent report for a comparable group of families who were receive help in traditionally operated child guidance services . 
these reports refer to a_level of secondary prevention in a child guidance clinic approach by the customary route of voluntary referral by the family or by other professional people . 
similarities to the approach which i have describe be evident in the prompt establishment of a helping relationship , quick appraisal of key issues , and the immediate mobilization of treatment plans as the essential dynamics in help to further the ego 's cope efforts in deal with the interplay of inner and outer stresses . 
while there are many different possibilities for the timing of casework intervention , the experiments recently report from a variety of traditional settings all point_up the importance of an immediate response to the client 's initial need for help . 
in some programs , treatment is concentrate over a short period_of_time , while in others , after the initial contact is establish , flexible spacing of interviews has been experimentally use with apparent success . 
willingness to take the risk of early and direct interpretation ( with the proviso that if the interpretation be too threatening , the worker can withdraw ) be another prominent feature in these efforts . 
my aim in mention this factor obviously is not to give license to `` wild therapy '' but rather to encourage us to use the time-honored clinical casework skills we already possess , and to use them with greater confidence , precision , and professional pride . 
though there be obviously great need for continued experimentation with various types of short-term intervention to further efforts in develop an operational definition of prevention at the secondary - or perhaps , in some instances , primary - level , the place of short-term intervention has already been document by a_number_of investigators in a wide variety of settings . 
woodward , for_example , has emphasize the `` need for a broad spectrum of services , include very brief services in connection with critical situations '' . 
ideally , brief treatment should be arrive_at as a treatment of choice rather_than as a treatment of chance . 
moreover , the shortage of treatment resources and the chronically persistent shortage of mental_health manpower force us to innovate additional refinements of preventive intervention techniques to make services more widely available - and on a more effective basis to more people . 
further research in the meaning of crises as experience by the consumers of traditional social casework services - include attempts to develop a typology of family structures , crisis problems , reaction mechanisms , and differential treatment approaches - and the establishment of new experimental programs be imperative social needs which should command the best efforts of caseworkers in_collaboration with community planners . 
our literature be already replete with a fantastic number of suggestions for preventive agency programming range from the immediately practical to the globally utopian . 
probably , in the immediate future , we will have to settle for middle-range efforts that fall_short_of utopian models . 
increased experimentation with multipurpose agencies , especially those that combine afresh the traditional functions of family and child_welfare_services , hold rich promise for the future . 
for_example , child welfare experience abound with cases in_which the parental request for substitute care is precipitate by a crisis event which is meaningfully link with a fundamental unresolved problem of family_relationships . 
tension management and communication of sentiment be the processes involve in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling . 
one of the devices for tension management be preferential mating . 
the preferential mating of_this particular population has been analyze in a separate study . 
the relative geographical isolation of the brandywine population make_for a limited choice in mating . 
it would seem necessary that members of_this population provide support for one another since it is not provide by the larger society . 
the supportive relations can apparently be achieve in geographical and social isolation . 
the newlyweds build homes on the same land with either set of parents , and the almost exclusive use of members of the population as sponsors for baptisms and weddings illustrate this supportive relationship . 
as loomis remark , `` in the internal pattern the chief reason for interacting be to communicate liking , friendship , and love among those who stand in supporting relations_to one another and corresponding negative sentiments to those who stand in antagonistic relations '' . 
maintenance of the status_quo might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of_this population today . 
yet , the object of the element of achieving through the process of goal attaining for this population appear to have been change by circumstances brought_about by the war . 
prior to world_war 2 , there was a higher percentage of endogamous marriages than after world_war 2 , . 
the norms , as elements , refer to `` all criteria for judge the character or conduct of both individual and group_actions in any social_system '' . 
the process of evaluation assign varying positive and negative priorities or values to elements . 
the elements and processes become evident in a study of mate selection in_this population . 
from the evidence `` it may be conjecture that core-core marriages be the preferred unions for core males and females ; core-marginal marriages still belong in the category of permissive unions ; and core-negro marriages are proscribe for core members '' . 
the element of status-roles and associated processes have not been sufficiently investigate for this population to permit any type of conjectures about them . 
there is some indication from a limited number of interviews with members of the population that the element of power , primarily the voluntary influence of non-authoritative power , has been exert on actors in the system , particularly in regard_to mate selection . 
this would seem to vary from family to family , depend_on somewhat on the core or marginal `` status '' of_that family . 
again , size of the group may have some influence on the strength of group controls . 
interviews with members of the brandywine population were attempt in_order_to discover the ranking of the various families in the population . 
the large majority of the interviewees place core families in the upper positions . 
loomis consider ranking a product of the evaluation process . 
`` the standing or rank of an actor in a given social_system is determine by the evaluation place upon the actor and his acts in_accordance_with the norms and standards of the system '' . 
despite the increasing rate of exogamous marriages , the population has be able to sustain , at_least to_some_degree , the consciousness of its intermediate status in society . 
to_some_extent the system can be consider a gemeinschaft in_which `` social-role occupancies are determine by birth , by attributes such_as sex or caste , which be biologically or socially immutable '' . 
the adherence of many in the population to the indian background in their pedigree , and emphasis upon the fact that their ancestors had never be slaves , become of prime interest in determine how far these elements promote the self-image of the intermediate status of the group in society . 
the negative sanctions apply to core-negro marriages for core members act_as indicators of expected adherence to group norms . 
however , because of church laws , lately more stringently enforce , which forbid the marriage of cousins closely related consanguineously , a means of facilitate the goal of in-group relations may be that of recourse to illegitimate unions . 
a cursory survey of available material indicate a high rate of illegitimate births occur to parents who have a close consanguineous relationship . 
the comprehensive or master processes activate all or some of the elements within the social_system and subsystems . 
within the larger social_system be the structural and functional subsystems . 
the structural subsystem , consist_of relatively stable inter-relationships among its parts , include . 
subgroups of various types , interconnect by relational norms . 
roles of various types , within the larger system and within the subgroups . 
regulative norms govern subgroups and roles . 
cultural values . 
in the study of marriage patterns for this group , consanguinity produce the structural system - a system of affinities - which , in_turn , maintain the system of consanguinity . 
subgroups of various types have been find within this system . 
each family_line can be consider a substructure . 
there seem to be an implied cultural value attach_to the fact of core status within the group . 
additionally , the proscription of core-negro marriages for core families , discuss above , would seem to act_as a regulative norm govern subgroups and roles . 
the scope of_this study does not provide_for the study of roles of various types within the larger system or within the subgroups . 
however , it cannot be presume , informal though the structure of the population seem , that there are not well-defined roles within the system . 
the present study relate to the theory of functional systems . 
it is hypothesize that fertility be a function of the social_system when the population as_a_whole is consider and a function of the subsystems when the two-fold division of core families and marginal families is consider . 
the four functional problems of a social_system are , to_some_extent , solve by the subsystems within this population . 
by means of geographical isolation and high fertility_rates , inbreeding can be foster and the pattern of isolation from the greater society maintain . 
in_order_to attain the goal of group solidarity and to relieve tension , the high fertility_rate provide more group members for mate selection , and the clustering of members in groups foster acceptance of group controls . 
to maintain their intermediate position in the larger society , it be not_only necessary that members of_this population be `` visible '' , but that their numbers be great enough to be recognize as a separate , distinct grouping or system in society . 
as mention above , where families are concentrate in larger numbers , group controls seem strongest and most effective . 
adaptation to the social and non-social environment through the economy has been meet to a degree through a type of occupational segregation . 
this provide the necessary contact with the larger society , while support a type of control over members in_terms_of social contacts . 
integration `` have to do with the inter-relation of parts '' . 
the problem of solidarity and morale again involve the concept of values . 
the values place by the brandywine population , upon maintain a certain homogeneity , a certain separate racial identity , and therefore a certain separate social_status , be important for the morale of the system . 
since morale is closely relate to pattern maintenance and integration , the higher the morale and solidarity , the better the system can solve the problems of the system . 
in_this respect it would seem that the greater the social distance between the brandywine population and the white and negro populations within the same general locality , the greater the possibility for higher morale and solidarity within the brandywine population . 
it is conceive that one of the means to attain this social distance be that of physical and social isolation . 
in_turn , higher fertility_rates for this population provide a means of increase the numerical_quantity of the population , allow_for the possibility of greater stability and unity . 
the population can thereby replenish itself and actually grow larger . 
of particular utility in the analysis of the development , persistence , and change of social_systems has be the use of the master or comprehensive processes . 
loomis consider six such processes in his paradigm . 
1 . 
communication 2 . 
boundary maintenance 3 . 
systemic linkage 4 . 
socialization 5 . 
social_control 6 . 
institutionalization though undoubtedly all six processes be operative within the whole social_system and its subsystems , two processes that be of crucial importance to this study will be single_out for particular emphasis : 
in discuss the process of communication , loomis define it as `` the process by which information , decisions , and directives are transmit among actors and the ways in_which knowledge , opinions , and attitudes are form , or modify by interaction '' . 
communication may be facilitate by means of the high visibility within the larger community . 
intense interaction be easier where segregated living and occupational segregation mark_off a group from the rest of the community , as in the case of_this population . 
however , the factor of physical isolation be not a static situation . 
although the brandywine population be still predominantly rural , `` there be indications of a consistent and a statistically significant trend away from the older and relatively isolated rural communities & & & urbanization appear to be an important factor in the disintegration of_this group . 
this conclusion be , however , an over-simplification . 
a more realistic analysis must take_into_account the fact that brandywine people in the urban-fringe area be , in_general , less segregated locally than group members in rural_areas . 
in the urban_area , in_other_words , they , unlike some urban ethnic_groups , do not concentrate in ghetto colonies . 
group pressures toward conformity be slight or non-existent , and deviant behavior in mate selection incur few if any social sanctions . 
in such a setting social contacts and associations be likely to be heterogamous , result in a change of values and almost necessarily , in mate selection behavior . 
to the extent that urban life contribute to the breakdown of the group patterns of residential isolation , to_that_extent it contribute directly to increased exogamy '' . 
the process of social_control be operative insofar as sanctions play a part in the individual 's behavior , as_well as the group 's behavior . 
by means of_this social_control , deviance is either eliminate or somehow make compatible with the function of the social_group . 
examples from this population indicate that deviance seem to be sanction by ostracism from the group . 
there is an oral tradition among the members of the population in regard_to the origin and subsequent separate status of the group in the larger society . 
confused and divided though this tradition may be , it be an important part of the social and cultural heritage of the group , and act_as a means of socialization , particularly for members of the rural community . 
the fact of indian ancestry and `` free '' status during the days of slavery , be important distinctions make by members of the group . 
`` culturally induced social cohesion result from common norms and values internalize by members of the group '' be operative in the boundary maintenance of the group as_well as in the process of socialization . 
the process of boundary maintenance identify and preserve the social_system or subsystems , and the characteristic interaction is maintain . 
as the threat of encroachment on the system increase , the `` probability of applied boundary maintenance mechanisms increase '' . 
the fertility_rate pattern would seem to be a function , though a latent one , of the process of maintain the boundary . 
`` increased boundary maintenance may be achieve , for_example , by assign a higher primacy or evaluation to activities characteristic of the external pattern '' . 
the external pattern or external system can be consider as `` group behavior that enable the group to survive in its environment '' . 
boundary maintenance for this group would seem to be primarily social , as be the preference for endogamy . 
it is also express in the proscription against deviants in the_matter of endogamy , particularly in rural_areas . 
by their pattern of endogamy and exogamy , the core families and the marginal families show distinct limits to the intergroup contact they maintain . 
where boundary maintenance describe the boundaries or limits of the group , systemic linkage is define `` as the process whereby one or more of the elements of at_least two social_systems is articulate in such a manner that the two systems in some ways and on some occasions may be view_as a single unit . 
a royal decree issue in 1910 , two years after the belgian government assume authority for the administration of the congo , prescribe the registration of all adult_males by chiefdoms . 
further decrees along this line were issue in 1916 and 1919 . 
in 1922 a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population was institute by ordinance of the governor-general , and the periodic compilation of these records was order . 
but specific procedures for carry_out this plan were leave to the discretion of the provincial governors . 
a unified set of regulations , applicable to all areas , was issue in 1929 , and a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was institute at_the_same_time . 
the whole system was again review and reorganize in 1933 . 
general responsibility for its administration rest with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor supply and native affairs , service_des_affaires_indigenes et de la main-d ' oeuvre ( aimo , direction , direction_generale , gouvernement_generale ) . 
tribal authorities , the chiefs and their secretaries , were hold responsible_for maintain the registers of indigenous persons within their territories , under the general supervision of district officials . 
the district officials , along with their other duties , were oblige to organize special demographic inquiries in selected areas and to supervise the annual tabulations of demographic statistics . 
the regulations require the inscription of each individual ( male or female , adult or child ) on a separate card ( fiche ) . 
the cards , file by circonscription ( sub-chiefdom , or village ) , are keep in the headquarters of each territoire ( chiefdom ) . 
each card is expect to show certain information about the individual concerned , include his or her date of birth ( or age at a specified time ) , spouses , and children . 
additional entries must be make from_time_to_time . 
different cards are use for males and females , and a corner is clip from the cards of adults , and of children when they reach puberty . 
so a quick count could be make at_any_time , even by an illiterate clerk , of the number of registered persons in four age-and-sex classes . 
personal identification cards are issue to all adult_males on_which tax payments , inoculations , periods of employment , and changes of residence are record . 
similar identification cards were issue in 1959 to all adult_females . 
each adult is hold personally responsible_for assure his inscription and obtain an identification card which must be show on demand . 
the registration card of a person leave his home_territory for a short period is put into a special file for absent persons . 
the cards of permanent out-migrants are , in_theory , send to an office in the place of new residence . 
finally , the registration of births and deaths by nearest relatives was make compulsory in most regions . 
numbers of registered persons in four age-and-sex classes were count each_year . 
in_addition , demographic inquiries , supposedly involve field investigations , were conduct in selected minor divisions ( circonscriptions ) contain about 3 percent of the total population . 
the results of these inquiries were use to adjust compilations of data from the registers and to provide various ratios and rates by districts , include birth and death_rates , general fertility_rates , distributions by marital_status , fertility of wives separately in polygynous and non-polygynous households , infant mortality , and migration . 
the areas to be examine in these inquiries were select by local officials , supposedly as representative of a larger population . 
averages of the ratios obtain in a_few selected areas were apply to the larger population . 
the scheme , in_theory , be an ingenious adaptation of european registration systems to the conditions of african life . 
but it place a severe strain on the administrative resources ( already burdened in_other_ways ) of a widely dispersed , poor and largely illiterate population . 
the sampling program was institute before the principles of probability sampling were widely recognize in population studies . 
the system be not well adapted to conditions of life in urban_centers . 
the distinction between domiciled ( de_jure ) and present ( de_facto ) population was not clearly define . 
so the results be subject to considerable confusion . 
the system tend to break_down during the war , but was reactivate ; it had reach the pre-war level of efficiency by 1951 . 
in_spite_of the defects in_this system , the figures on total population during the late 1930 's and again in the early 1950 's seem to have represent actual conditions in most districts with approximate fidelity . 
but the information on the dynamics of population be often quite misleading . 
the same system , with minor modifications , was develop in ruanda-urundi under belgian administration . 
here again it seem that useful approximations of the size and geographical distribution of the population were obtain in_this_way in the late pre-war and early post-war periods . 
before consider more recent activities , we should note another important aspect of demography in belgian africa . 
a_number_of strong independent agencies , establish in some cases with governmental or royal support , have conduct large medical , social , educational and research operations in_particular parts of the congo and ruanda-urundi . 
the work of fonds_reine_elisabeth pour l ' assistance_medicale aux indigenes_du_congo_belge ( foreami ) have special interest with_respect_to demography . 
this agency accept responsibility for medical services to a population range from 638560 persons in 1941 to 840503 in 1956 in the kwango_district and adjacent areas east of leopoldville . 
each_year from 1941 on , its medical staff had conduct intensive field investigations to determine changes in population structure and vital rates and , as its primary objective , the incidence of major diseases . 
its findings are report each_year in its rapport sur l ' activite pendant annee ( bruxelles ) . 
somewhat similar investigations have been make by medical_officers in other areas . 
other independent , or partially independent agencies , have promote investigations on topics directly or indirectly related_to demography . 
these studies vary widely in scope and precision . 
l ' institut pour la recherche_scientifique en afrique_centrale ( irsac ) has sponsor well-designed field investigations and has cooperate closely with the government of ruanda-urundi in the development of its official statistics . 
a massive investigation of the characteristics of in-migrants and prospective out-migrants in ruanda-urundi is being carry_on by j._j._maquet , former director of the social_science branch of irsac , now a professor at l ' universite_officielle_du_congo_belge et du_ruanda-urundi . 
some 30000 completed schedules with 20 items ( collect by sub-chiefs in 1100 circumscriptions ) have been tabulate . 
the results are now being analyze . 
statistics have been recognize as a matter of strategic importance in the congo and in ruanda-urundi during the post-war years in connection with long-term economic and social programs . 
the aimo organizations of both countries , which maintain administrative services throughout the territories , retain immediate responsibility for the collection and publication of demographic information . 
however , the statistical offices of both governments were assign responsibility for the planning and analysis of these statistics . 
a bureau de la demographie ( a._romaniuk , director ) was form under aimo in the congo , to work in close rapport with the section statistique of the secretariat_general . 
eventually responsibility for demographic inquiries in the congo was transfer to the demographic division of the central_statistical_office . 
the 1952 demographic inquiry in ruanda-urundi was direct by v._neesen , a member of the irsac staff , though the inquiry was carry_out under the auspices of aimo , which have continuing responsibility for demographic statistics in_this territory . 
a member of the irsac staff ( e._van de walle ) was recently delegate to cooperate with aimo in the development of demographic statistics in_this territory . 
the initiation of sampling censuses in ruanda-urundi ( 1952 ) and in the congo ( 1955 - 57 ) be major advances . 
we will deal first with the program in the congo though this was put into operation later than the other . 
the radical nature of the innovation in the congo was not emphasize in the official announcements . 
the term enquetes demographiques , previously use for the supplementary investigations carry_out in connection with the administrative censuses , was use for the new investigations . 
however , the differences in procedure be fundamental . 
these be as_follows : 
field operations were transfer from administrative personnel primarily engage in other tasks to specially trained teams of full-time african investigators ( three teams , each work in two provinces ) . 
these teams carry_out the same operations successively in different areas . 
sample areas in the new investigations were select strictly by application of the principles of probability_theory , so_as_to be representative of the total population of defined areas within calculable limits . 
in_short , scientific sampling was introduce in_place of subjective sampling . 
the populations of the various districts , or other major divisions , were stratify by type of community ( rural , urban , mixed ) and , where appropriate , by ethnic affiliation and by type of economy . 
sample units ( villages in rural_areas , houses in cities ) were draw systematically within these strata . 
different sampling ratios were apply under different conditions . 
higher proportions were sample in urban and mixed communities than in rural_areas . 
about 11 percent of the total population was cover in the new investigation , as compare with about 3 percent in the previous inquiries . 
uniform questions , definitions , and procedures were enforce throughout the whole country . 
data were obtain , separately , on three classes of persons : ( a ) residents , present ; ( b ) residents , absent ; and ( c ) visitors . 
in the reports , summary results are give for both the de_facto ( a and c ) and de_jure ( a and b ) populations ; but the subsequent analysis of characteristics is report only for the de_jure population ( or , in some districts , only the de_facto population ) . 
these changes represent in_effect , a shift from ( 1 ) an administrative compilation of data obtain through procedures design primarily to serve political and economic objectives to ( 2 ) a systematic sampling census of the whole african population . 
the population registration system still have important functions . 
it supply local data which be useful in administration and which can be use as a basis for intensive studies in_particular situations . 
it provide a frame for the sampling census . 
it also provide a frame within which the registration of vital events is gradually gain force ( though one cannot expect to obtain reliable vital statistics in most parts of the congo from this source in the near future ) . 
it is still use in make current population estimates in post-census years , though the value of these estimates be open_to question . 
finally , it may have certain very important , less obvious values . 
even_though the registers may have an incomplete record of persons present in a particular area or include persons no_longer live there , they contain precise information on ages , by date of birth , for some of the persons present ( especially children in relatively stable communities ) and supplementary information ( such_as records of marital_status ) for many others . 
the quality of the census data can , therefore , be greatly improve by the use of the registration records in conjunction with the field inquiries . 
furthermore , it may be possible to estimate the error due_to bias in method ( as distinguish from sampling error ) in each of these sources , on such subjects as fertility , mortality , and migration during a given interval by use information from two largely independent sources in conjunction . 
the first sampling census in the congo extend over a three-year period , 1955 - 57 ; the results were still being process in 1959 . 
it is plan to double the number of teams and to make use of improved equipment in a second demographic inquiry in 1960 , so_that the inquiry can be carry_through in one year and the results publish more expeditiously . 
it is propose that in_the_future complete sampling censuses be carry_out at five-year intervals . 
reports already issue on the sampling census , 1955 - 57 , in various areas run as_follows ( use only the_french and omit corresponding flemish titles ) : . 
this report contain preliminary notes and 35 tables . 
other reports in identical form , but with somewhat varying content , have been issue for : . 
these area reports will be follow , according to present plans , by a summary report , which will include a detailed statement on methods . 
with this evidence in mind , the writer begin to plan how he might more effectively educate the married students in his functional classes . 
toward the end of the semester 's work , he interview every married class member at_great_length . 
he find , as he had suspect , a general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally designed course be not really functional for these students . 
however , all admit that the `` hind sight '' be not altogether lost . 
in their own words , it had aid them to get a clearer picture of how they had get_into their marriages , and perhaps they had obtain some insights on why certain troubles appear from_time_to_time . 
in_fact , they go so_far as to caution the writer that if he attempt to design a section exclusively for married students there should be , at the beginning , some `` hind sight '' study ; but they all hasten to add that certainly less time was need on_it than presently spend . 
all_of them feel a compelling need for more coverage on areas that could be only lightly touch_on in a general survey functional course . 
a_few be doubtful about the merits of an exclusive section for married students . 
as one of them express it , `` it has do_good me a world of good to listen to the nai ^ ve questions and comments of these not-yet-married people . 
i can now better see just what processes provoke certain actions from me in_the_past . 
had i be in an all-married section i would have miss this , and i believe that this single aspect has be of great personal value to me '' . 
this comment and_others similar to_it , would seem to indicate a possible justification for continue the status_quo . 
but the weight of feeling be heavily in_the_opposite_direction . 
thus , the writer decide to hold one experimental section of the functional preparation for marriage course in the spring semester of 1960 exclusively for persons already married - that_is , prerequisite : `` marriage '' . 
this did not mean that married students could not enroll in other `` mixed '' sections , and some of them , largely because of scheduling difficulties , did . 
but only those already married could enroll in_this one section . 
in_addition , two other differences in the two types of sections must be note . 
1 ) the regular sections do not allow freshmen ; this one did . 
this action was rationalize on the basis of a small survey which indicate that a high percentage of married freshmen women on our campus never become sophomores . 
many_of them appear to drop_out , for one reason or another . 
by permit freshman students we might extend the opportunity for such a course to some individuals who otherwise might never get to take it . 
this has subsequently been verify by the experience . 
2 ) auditors were encourage . 
in the regular sections they have always been more_or_less discourage . 
the philosophy has be that if they could find the time to attend class why not encourage them to get the credit and perhaps provide an incentive to do the work more effectively . 
besides , auditors do not count on faculty load with the same weight as regularly enrolled students . 
but in_this one section we welcome auditors . 
why ? 
for no particular reason , other_than that the writer feel it might - just might - encourage both mates to be in_attendance . 
many_of the men on our campus have a pretty set curriculum , especially in the various engineering fields , with few electives till the senior year . 
incidentally , it need to be note that because auditors were permit the section begin increase in numbers each_week , until at_last it swell to such proportions that this `` free '' auditing policy have to be retract . 
after_that , we begin to get `` visitors '' to class . 
this experimental class represent quite a variety of students . 
it range from a freshman woman , just marry , through the various academic growth stages , include one senior-graduate student , to a young faculty_member recently marry to a senior man who also attend . 
it range from those with no children , through students in various stages of pregnancy , to one 44 - year-old male with four children , three of whom be teenagers . 
it range from two women members who had experience premarital pregnancy to one couple twelve years married and seemingly unable to conceive . 
one might digress at this point and speculate that if it be `` wise '' to create special sections for special status , then why not a special section for women pregnant before marriage , and one for 44 - year-old men with teenage children , and_so_on . 
some of these speculations may have some merit , others be somewhat ambiguous . 
but few who have experience marriage can dispute the fact that the focus of interpersonal relationships be different in marriage than in a pre-marital situation . 
the writer begin this special class by explain his background thinking for create such a section in_the_first_place . 
he make it clear from_the_beginning that this be the students ' opportunity , and that the future destiny of such groups depend_on favorable results from this one . 
he did build a framework of academic `` respectability '' , and one which did not encroach_upon the `` sacred sovereignty '' of any other existing campus course . 
this be to say that this be not a course in wise buying or money spending methods , nor a course in how to raise children . 
we already have courses cover those problems , and_so_on . 
but within that framework he allow_for as much flexibility as possible . 
a steering_committee of students was organize on the first day whose duty it be to be alert and constantly evaluate and reevaluate the direction and pace the class was take . 
the writer , be cognizant through his interviews of the reactions of previous married students , did insist on there being include some `` hind sight '' material . 
but the greater part of semester time was actually center around the attitudes `` so we be married - now how do we make the best of_it '' ? or `` how do we enrich our already fine marriage '' ? 
films were use , as with all sections , but with one big difference . 
our campus , unfortunately , own no films . 
since they are all either rent or borrow , the requested dates for their use have to be far in_advance . 
the writer never know from week to week just where the section might be . 
for_example , the steering_committee might announce that the group feel a topic under study should not be drop for an additional week as there be still too_much of_it untouched . 
since the writer had establish this democratic procedure in_the_beginning he have to go_along with their decision - after , of_course , point_out whether he think their decision be a wise or an unwise one . 
thus the films see as they come_in ( coordinate for the regular sections ) , be often out of context . 
nevertheless , the writer has never experience such spontaneity of discussion after film showings . 
though it did not become known to the writer for_some_time , a nucleus group had spring_up within the class . 
they begin to meet in the evenings and carry_forward various discussions they feel not fully enough cover in class . 
from a_few students this group gradually increase to include over three-fourths of those officially enrolled in the class , and many outsiders as_well . 
also , although only a_few of the students be intimately acquainted_with each other in_the_beginning , most report that when the semester end their dearest and closest campus friendships be with members of_that class . 
in_fact , they often revamp their social_activities to include class members previously unknown . 
supplemental outside reading reports were handle just_as in the other sections , the major difference be that there be a noticeably deeper level in the reported outside reading by the married group . 
these students , although they might read various articles in popular magazines , more_often choose to report on articles find in the journals . 
in_addition to the noticeable difference in outside articles , there be a considerable difference in the outside books they read . 
whereas a high per_cent of the regular students can be expect to read other texts which more_or_less plow the same ground in a_little different direction , the married students choose whole books on specific areas and go into much greater detail in their areas of interest . 
since the writer had not notice this characteristic in married students scattered throughout the various sections previous to this experiment , nor , as_a_matter_of_fact , in those who were continue in `` single sections '' , he can only conclude that there must have be something `` contagious '' within the specific group which cause this to occur . 
in_the_main , this course take the following directional high roads : 1 ) a great_deal of time was spend on processes for solve marital differences . 
this be not a search for a `` magic formula '' , but rather an examination of basic_principles pertain especially to all types of communication in marriage . 
in_short , it was center around learn how to develop a more sensitive empathy . 
not until the group was satisfy in_this area were they willing to venture further to 2 ) specific adjustment areas , such_as sex , in-laws , religion , finance , and_so_on . 
from here they proceed to 3 ) these same areas in_relation_to their own future family life stages , develop these to the extent of examine various crises which could be expect to confront them at_some_time or other . 
as an example of_this last facet , there be some lengthy discussions center around bereavement . 
mainly these be concerned with the possibility of the death of one parent and the complication of live with the survivor afterward , but the possible death of one 's own spouse was not overlook . 
since the course , one member has lose her husband . 
this be not a particularly shocking or unexpected thing - it be previously known to her that it might happen . 
but just when be an unknown , and of_course the longer it did not happen , the stronger her wish and belief that it might not . 
since her bereavement this individual has report to the writer on numerous occasions about how helpful the class discussions be to her in_this adjustment crisis . 
quite frequently class members bring questions from their mates at_home . 
these were often carefully write out with a great_deal of thought behind them . 
this add a personal zest to class discussions and participation . 
both sexes report that the discussions on sex adjustment within marriage be extremely enlightening . 
the writer sense a much freer and more frank discussion , especially of_this one area , than ever before . 
he feel certain for_the_first_time in his teaching experience that the men in the class understand that orgasm , as a criterion , be not_nearly so essential for a satisfying female sexual experience as most males might think . 
this be probably much more meaningful because all the women in the class emphasize it time_and_again . 
on_the_other_hand , the women class members appear to reach a far greater understanding than have women members in other sections that it be more natural for males as_a_group to view sex as sex rather_than always associate it with_love as most women seem to do . 
in the reproductive area it could be readily observe that all feel freer to discuss things than students had previously in `` mixed '' marital_status sections . 
perhaps this was relate to the fact that all be in on_it to_some_extent . 
never in other sections has there be the opportunity for the genuine down-to-earth discussions about the feelings of both spouses during various stages of pregnancy . 
there be a particularly marvelous opportunity for study in_this area since almost every stage of pregnancy was represent , from a childless couple to and include every trimester . 
in_fact , we have one birth before the end of the course , and another student had_to take the final examiantion a week early , just to be on the safe side . 
there be also one spontaneous abortion during the semester . 
thus it be reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief `` structuring '' experience . 
it was predict that kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal , concretistic reports of_what the ambiguous figure `` look_like '' as reflect their hesitancy about take_a_chance . 
this be true mostly of those kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action . 
responses such_as `` rope with a loop in it '' , and `` two pieces of rope '' , be quite characteristic . 
the three personality inventories ( guilford_stdcr ; guilford-martin_gamin ; guilford-martin_oagco ) , were fill_out by 12 of the kohnstamm-positive subjects and 19 of the kohnstamm-negative subjects . 
these be the same subjects who were give the rorschach test . 
some predictions had been make concerning factors r , n , i and co on these inventories which appear to be directly relate to control and security aspects of personality functioning which were hypothesize as be of importance in differential kohnstamm reactivity . 
only co differentiate between the two groups at less_than the 5  level ( * * f ) . 
one prediction had been make about the difference in security or self-confidence between those subjects who shift their kohnstamm reactivity when inform and those who did not . 
the nonreactors had been separate into two groups on this assumption with the presumably `` secure '' nonreactors and `` secure '' reactors being use as the groups for comparative personality studies . 
it was predict that those who shift in their kohnstamm reactivity would differ significantly from those who did not on the factor i which the investigators refer to as the `` inferiority '' factor . 
all_of the subjects in the kohnstamm-negative and kohnstamm-positive groups ( as define for purposes of the personality studies ) were compare with those subjects who shift in conditions 3 , or 4 , . 
a t test on these two groups , shifters vs. nonshifters , give a `` t '' value of 2.405 which be significant on the two-tail test at the .028 level . 
individual differences in kohnstamm reactivity to controlled kohnstamm situations were find among the subjects use in the study . 
only 27  ( 11 subjects ) give a positive kohnstamm reaction when completely nai ^ ve concerning the phenomenon . 
there were 49  ( 20 subjects ) who did not give a positive reaction even after they were inform of the normalcy of such a reaction and had been give a demonstration . 
there were 24  ( 10 subjects ) who shift from a negative to a positive reaction after they were reassure as to the normalcy of the kohnstamm-positive reaction . 
among this latter group there were also differences in the amount and kind_of information necessary before a shift in reaction occur . 
one subject change when give only the information that some people have something happen to their arm when they relax . 
five subjects ( 12  ) did not change until they had been tell that some people have something happen to their arm , what that something be , and also were give a demonstration . 
four subjects ( 10  ) did not change even then but need the additional information that an arm-elevation under these circumstances be a perfectly normal reflex reaction which some people show while others did not . 
at_no_time was it imply by the experimenter that the subject 's initial reaction be deviant . 
the subjects were only give information about other possibilities of `` normal '' reaction . 
those who respond with an arm-elevation in the nai ^ ve state did not change their reaction when tell that there were some normal people who did not react in_this fashion . 
this information was accept with the frequent interpretation that those persons who did not show arm-levitation must be prevent it . 
these subjects imply that they too could prevent their arms from rise if they try . 
the positive kohnstamm reactivity in_condition 1 , ( the nai ^ ve state ) is not adequately explain by such a concept as suggestibility ( if suggestibility is define as the influence on behavior by verbal cues ) . 
in_no_way , either verbally or behaviorally , did the experimenter indicate to the subjects any preferred mode of respond to the voluntary contraction . 
moreover , when the experimenter did inform those subjects that there were some normal people who did not have their arm rise once they relax , the kohnstamm-positive subjects be uninfluenced in their subsequent reactions to the kohnstamm situation . 
they continue to give an arm-elevation . 
a differential suggestibility would have to be invoke to explain the failure of_this additional information to influence the kohnstamm-positive reactors and yet attribute their nai ^ ve kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion . 
autosuggestibility , the reaction of the subject in_such_a_way as to conform_to his own expectations of the outcome ( i. e. , that the arm-rise be a reaction to the pressure exert in the voluntary contraction , because of his knowledge that `` to every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction '' ) also seem inadequate as an explanation for the following reasons : ( 1 ) the subjects ' apparently genuine experience of surprise when their arms rise , and ( 2 ) manifestations of the phenomenon despite anticipations of something else happen ( e._g. , of become dizzy and maybe fall , an expectation spontaneously volunteer by one of the subjects ) . 
a suggestion hypothesis also seem inadequate as an explanation for those who shift their reactions after they were inform of the possibilities of `` normal '' reactions different from those which they give . 
while they were tell that there were some normal people who react differently than they had , they were also inform that there were other normals who react as they had . 
there was no implication make that their initial reaction ( absence of an arm-elevation ) be less preferred than the presence of levitation . 
a more tenable explanation for the change in reactions be that the added knowledge and increased familiarity with the total situation make it possible for these subjects to be less guarded and to relax , since any reaction seem acceptable to the examiner as `` normal '' . 
the nai ^ ve state , condition 1 , , could therefore be view_as an inhibiting one for 24  of the subjects in_this study . 
they be not free to be themselves in_this situation , an interpersonal one , where there was an observer of their reactions and they have no guide for acceptable behavior . 
instructions to relax , i. e. , to be `` spontaneous '' , and react immediately to whatever impulse they might have , be not sufficiently reassuring until some idea of the possibilities of normal reactions had been give . 
while other conditions might be even more effective in bring_about a change from immobility to mobility in kohnstamm reactivity , it be our hypothesis that all such conditions would have as a common_factor the capacity to induce an attitude in the subject which enable him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of responsibility for his behavior . 
alcohol ingestion succeed in change immobility to mobility quite strikingly in one pilot subject ( the only one with whom this technique was try ) . 
this subject , who has been undergo psychoanalytic psychotherapy for five years , did not give a positive kohnstamm reaction under any of the four standardized conditions use in_this experiment while sober . 
after two drinks contain alcohol , her arm fly upward very freely . 
there be evident delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of the freedom of movement . 
she describe herself as have the same kind_of `` irresponsible '' feeling as she had once experience under hypnosis . 
she ascribe her delight with both experiences to the effect they seem to have of temporarily remove from her the controls which she feel so compulsively necessary to maintain even when it might seem appropriate to relax these controls . 
many subjects attribute differences in kohnstamm reactivity to differences in degrees of subjective control - voluntary as the kohnstamm-positive subjects perceive it and involuntary as the kohnstamm-negative subjects perceive it . 
these suggested interpretations were give by the subjects spontaneously when they were tell that there were people who react differently than they had . 
the kohnstamm-positive subjects describe the vivid experience of have their arms rise as one in_which they exercise no control . 
they explain its absence in others on the basis of an intervention of control factors . 
they feel that they too could counteract the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they had once experience the reaction . 
some of those who did not initially react with an arm-elevation also associate their behavior in the situation with control factors - an inability to relinquish control voluntarily . 
one subject spontaneously ask ( after her arm had finally rise ) , `` do you suppose i was unconsciously keep it down before '' ? 
another say that her arm did not go_up at_first `` because i would n't let it ; i think it be n't supposed to '' . 
this subject be one who give an arm-elevation on the second trial in the nai ^ ve state but not in the first . 
she had feel that her arm want to go_up in the first trial , but had consciously prevent it from so do . 
she explain nonreactivity of others by say that they were `` not let themselves relax '' . 
when inform that there were some persons who did not have their arm go_up , she comment , `` i do n't see how they can prevent it '' . 
in contrast to this voluntary-control explanation for nonreactivity give by the kohnstamm-positive subjects , the kohnstamm-negative subjects offer an involuntary-control hypothesis to explain nonreactivity . 
they feel that they were relax as much_as they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent response must be on an unconscious level . 
the above discussion does not mean to imply that control factors be completely in_abeyance in the kohnstamm-positive subjects ; but rather that they could be diminish sufficiently not to interfere with arm-levitation . 
one kohnstamm-positive subject who have both arms rise while being test in the nai ^ ve condition describe her subjective experience as_follows : `` you feel they 're go_up and you be on a stage and it be not right for them to do so and_then you think maybe that be what 's supposed to happen '' . 
she then describe her experience as one in_which she first have difficulty accept for herself a state of being in_which she relinquish control . 
however , she be able to relax and yield to the moment . 
it be our hypothesis that kohnstamm-positive subjects be less hesitant about relinquish control than be kohnstamm-negative subjects ; that they can give_up their control and allow themselves to be reactors rather_than actors . 
it be our belief that this readiness to relinquish some control was evidence by the kohnstamm-positive subjects in some of the other experimental situations to be discuss below . 
thus , this readiness to relax controls , evidence in the kohnstamm situation , appear to be a more general personality factor . 
the kohnstamm-positive subjects seem to be freer to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible in the external world . 
there was a significantly greater number in_this group who report a desk as be in a tilted position while a tennis_ball rest_on it remain stationary on the incline . 
this occur in_spite_of the rational awareness that the ball should be go downhill . 
they know that their perceptual experience differ from objective reality since they had see the desk and ball prior to put_on the aniseikonic lenses . 
yet they were not so bound by past experience and constriction as to deny their immediate perceptions and to be dominated_by their knowledge of_what the experience should be . 
the change in perceptions by some of the kohnstamm-negative subjects , after they had been inform of the possibilities of normal reactions , suggest that their constriction and guardedness is associated with their general mode of respond to strange or unknown situations . 
they be able to experience at_first , in_terms_of past conventionality . 
when inform as to the various possibilities of normal reactions , they be then able to experience the uniqueness of the present . 
it might be postulate that these subjects be unduly afraid_of be wrong ; that they perceive new internal and environmental situations as `` threatening '' until they are test and prove otherwise . 
while the interpretations that have been give be inferences only , they gain support from such comments as the following , which was make by one of the kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not , on the first trial , perceive the tilt illusion . 
j28-6105 . 
form j28-6033-1 . 
there be thirty-eight patients on the bus the morning i leave for hanover , most_of them disturbed and hallucinating . 
an interne , a nurse and two attendants be in charge of us . 
i feel lonely and depressed as i stare out the bus window at chicago 's grim , dirty west_side . 
it seem incredible , as i listen to the monotonous drone of voices and smell the fetid odors come from the patients , that technically i be a ward of the state of illinois , go_to a hospital for the mentally_ill . 
i suddenly think_of mary_jane brennan , the way her pretty eyes could flash with_anger , her quiet competence , the gentleness and sweetness that lie just beneath the surface of her defenses . 
we had become good friends during my stay at cook_county_hospital . 
i had tell her enough about myself to offset somewhat the damaging stories that had appear in local newspapers after my little adventure in marshall_field + co. . 
she know that i live at a good address on the gold_coast , that i had once be a medical_student and was think_of return to the university to finish my medical studies . 
she know also that i be unmarried and without a single known relative . 
she be n't quite sure that i feel enough remorse about my drinking , or that i would not return to it once i be out and on my own again . 
this had worry her . 
`` i read those newspaper stories about you '' , she had say . 
`` you must have love that girl very_much , but you could n't have mean it when you say that you want to kill her '' . 
`` why do you say that '' ? 
i ask . 
`` i be full of booze and , well , a drunk be apt to do anything he say he 'll do '' . 
nonsense ! 
i grow_up in an irish neighborhood on chicago 's west_side . 
do n't tell me about drunks . 
you be not the kind to go violent . 
be you in_love with_that girl `` ? 
`` would it make any difference to you if i be , mary_jane '' ? 
she meet my eyes , suddenly angry . 
`` i would n't have go into nursing if i did n't care about people . 
i be interested in every patient i 've help take care of . 
when i think_of people like you , well , i '' - 
`` you what , mary_jane '' ? 
`` you be young , intelligent , have a whole lifetime before you to make something worth while of yourself , but you mess_up it up with whiskey , indifference , self-destructive attitudes . 
i do n't blame that girl for break her engagement with you . 
be she pretty '' ? 
`` oh , yes '' , i say , feel annoyed , `` she be very pretty . 
you do n't believe that i 'm go_back to medical_school and finish , do you '' ? 
`` why should i ? 
i 've work this ward for three months now . 
we keep get the same ones back again_and_again . 
they all mean well , have great promises to make when they be about to go_home , but drinking be their sickness . 
you 've not seem like them , but maybe you be . 
you 've treat your stay here like a big joke . 
it be not a joke to be send to a place like this or to hanover . 
i want to go_to college , to '' - 
`` why did n't you '' ? 
i ask . 
`` chicago have some of the best '' - 
her eyes flash angrily . 
`` that be what i mean about you , anderson '' , she say . 
`` you do n't seem to know much about reality . 
i 'll tell you why i did n't go_to college ; i be the oldest of six children . 
my father 's a policeman and make less_than seven thousand dollars a year . 
there was no money for tuition , for clothes , for all the things you apparently take_for_granted . 
nurses ' training here does n't cost anything . 
they even pay me six dollars a month . 
i think it be a good_deal . 
i 'm going_to become a good nurse , and i 've get two baby brothers that are going_to have college if i have to work_at my profession until i be an old_maid to give it to them '' . 
`` do you have a boy friend '' ? 
i ask . 
`` that be none of your business '' , she say , then change the subject . 
`` what about your father and mother , do n't you think_of them when you be in a place like this '' ? 
`` my father and mother die when i be two years old '' , i say . 
`` my aunt raise me . 
aunt_mary die when i was do my military_service . 
i have no one but myself to worry about '' . 
something in my voice must have touch her deeply because her anger pass quickly , and she turn_away to keep me from see her face . 
`` i be sorry '' , she say . 
`` i do n't know what i 'd do without my family . 
we 've always be so close '' . 
`` tell me more about them '' . 
her eyes become bright as she talk_about her father and mother , aunts and uncles , cousins . 
listen , i feel cheated and lonely as only an orphan can . 
when she had finish i say : 
`` your dad sound like a good father and a good policeman . 
i 'll bet he would n't be pleased if a rumdum like me were to ask his daughter for a date - i mean , after i be out of the hospital , a month or_so from now '' . 
`` my father be a sergeant of detectives and has be attached to homicide for five years . 
he be a pretty good judge of character , anderson . 
i do n't think he 'd mind too_much if he be sure you 'd decide not to be a rumdum in_the_future '' . 
`` what about you ? 
how would you feel about it if i were to ask you for a date when i get_through at hanover '' ? 
`` if i think you be serious about go_back to school , that you 'd learn something from your experiences here and at hanover - well , i might consider such an offer . 
what about your & & & that girl you were going_to kill '' ? 
it suddenly seem very important to me that mary_jane brennan should know the truth about me - that i be not the confused , sick , irresponsible person she believe me to be . 
`` there are things about me that i can n't tell you now , mary_jane '' , i say , `` but if you 'll go_out to dinner with me when i get_out of hanover , i 'd like to tell you the whole story . 
i can say this : i be dead serious about go_back to school . 
as for that other girl , let 's just say that i never want to see her again . 
you will get to come home on long weekends from hanover , won n't you '' ? 
`` yes , i 'll get one overnight a month '' . 
`` we 'll go_up to the edgewater_beach_hotel for dinner '' , i say . 
`` do you like to dance ? 
they always have a good orchestra '' . 
`` i like to dance '' , she say , then turn and walk away . 
there had n't been anything really personal in her interest in me . 
i know that . 
it be just that she feel deeply about every patient on the ward and want to believe that they might benefit from their treatment there . 
now , ride this hospital bus , feel isolated and utterly alone , i know that she be genuine and unique , quite unlike any girl i had know before . 
it seem the_most important thing in my life at this moment that she should know the real truth about me . 
it be a fantastic story . 
only two people in the state of illinois know that i was enter hanover_state_hospital under an assumed_name , or why . 
it be unlikely that any girl as sharp as mary_jane brennan would believe it without proof . 
but i have the proof , all documented in a legal agreement which i would show her the moment i be free to do so . 
as the bus turn into the main highway and head toward hanover i settle back in my seat and close my eyes , think_over the events of the past two_weeks , try to put the pieces in_order . 
i wonder suddenly as i listen to the disconnected jabberings come from the patient behind me , if i had not perhaps imagine it all . 
perhaps this be reality and dale_nelson , the actor , be delusion ; a figment of carl_anderson 's imagination . 
i had come to chicago from new_york early in september with a dramatic_production called ask_tony . 
it be a bad play , real grade-a turkey , which only a prevalence of angels with grandiose dreams of capital_gain and tax money to burn could have put into rehearsal . 
no one , not even the producer , have any real hope of get it back to broadway . 
but because it be a suspense gangster story of the capone era , many_of us feel that it might catch_on for a run in chicago , continue as a road company , and eventually become a movie . 
such optimism be completely unjustified . 
the critics literally scream their indignation . 
ask_tony was doom from the moment kupcinet level on_it in his sun-times column . 
we open on friday and close the following monday . 
out of the entire cast i alone receive good notices for my portrayal of a psychopathic killer . 
this let me in_for a_lot_of kidding from the rest of the company , two members of_which be native chicagoans . 
we were pay_off tuesday morning and give tickets back to new_york . 
i feel lonely and depressed as i pack my bags at the croydon_hotel . 
it seem to me that my life was destine to be one brilliant failure after another . 
i had be among the top third in my class at n._y._u. , had want desperately to go_to medical_school , but i 'd run_out of money and energy at_the_same_time . 
then later i had quit my safe , secure five-a-week spot on a network soap_opera to take a part in_this play . 
it seem to me that i be not_only unlucky but quite stupid as_well . 
i know that i 'd soon be back work as an orderly at the hospital or as a counterman at union_news or schraffts while wait for another acting job to open . 
it suddenly occur to me that i did not particularly like acting , that i be at some sort_of crossroads and would have to decide soon what i was going_to do with my life . 
i close the last bag and stand all three at the door for the bellboy to pick_up , then go_to the bathroom for a drink of water . 
the telephone ring . 
when i answer it a voice too dignified and british to be real say , `` be this mr._dale_nelson , the actor '' ? 
`` all_right '' , i say . 
`` why do n't you bastards lay_off for_a_while '' ? 
`` i beg your pardon , sir '' ? 
`` all_right . 
this be dale_nelson , the actor '' . 
`` good . 
i 'm call you , mr._nelson , at the request of mr._phillip_wycoff . 
could you possibly have lunch with him today ? 
his car could pick_up you up at your hotel at twelve '' . 
i smile . 
`` you 'll send the rolls-royce , of_course '' ? 
`` yes , of_course , mr._nelson '' . 
i start to say something else appropriate , but the man had hang_up . 
i finally go downstairs to the bar off the main lobby where most_of the cast were drown their sorrows over the untimely passing of ask_tony . 
they all bow low as i approach them . 
`` all_right , you bastards '' , i say , `` the great actor is_about to buy a drink '' . 
i lay a tenspot on the bar and motion to the bartender to serve a round . 
he had just return my change when the doorman come_in off the street to page me . 
i walk over to him . 
`` you mr._nelson '' ? he ask . 
`` that be right '' . 
`` mr. wycoff 's car is wait for you at the east entrance '' . 
i follow him out through the lobby to the street . 
an ancient rolls-royce , as shiningly impressive as the day it come off the ship , be parked at the curb . 
the elderly chauffeur , immaculate in a dark uniform , stand stiffly at attention hold open the door of the town car . 
i was giving the parked cars the once-over . 
the oldsmobile with the license_number jyj 114 be in stall number five . 
`` okay '' , i say to the attendant , `` i 'll let you know if i close the deal on the office in_this building '' . 
i walk with him back to the entrance . 
he give me a ticket on the agency car and park it . 
i be back in ten minutes . 
`` forget to get something out of the car '' , i tell him , show him my ticket . 
he start to say something as i walk in and_then suddenly grin and say , `` oh , yes . 
you be the one i was talk to about a monthly rental . 
`` that be right '' , i tell him . 
he consult the parking_ticket , then look at a notation and say , `` you be in the third row back toward_the_rear . 
can you find it all_right '' ? 
`` sure '' , i tell him . 
i go_back to the agency car and get_out an electric bug , one of the newest devices for electronic shadowing . 
i always keep a set in the car . 
i put_in new batteries so_as_to be certain i 'd have plenty of power and on my way_out walk over to the regular parking stalls and stand look at them thoughtfully . 
i wait until the parking attendant be busy with a customer , then slip around the back of the car with license_number jym 114 , attach the electronic bug to_the_rear bumper and walk_out . 
the attendant wave me on . 
one of the hardest chores a detective have be hang_around on a city street , try to make himself inconspicuous , keep_an_eye_on the entrance of an office_building and wait . 
for the first fifteen or twenty minutes it be possible to be more_or_less interested in window displays , then in people pass_by . 
after a while , however , a person 's mind get fed_up and that magnify all_of the disagreeable physical symptoms which go_with that sort_of an assignment . 
you want to sit_down . 
your leg muscles and back muscles feel weary . 
you be conscious_of the fact that your feet hurt , that the city pavements be hard . 
i wait a solid two hours before my man come_out of the office_building . 
he come_out alone . 
i be n't far behind him when he enter the parking_lot and hurry over to his car . 
the attendant recognize me once_more and say , `` what did you do about that office '' ? 
`` i have n't make_up_one's_mind my mind yet '' , i say . 
`` it be a sublease . 
i have a_couple_of them i 'm figure on ; one here and one that be out quite a ways where there 's usually curb parking '' . 
`` that curb parking be undependable and annoying , particularly when it rain '' , he say . 
i keep try to get him to take my money . 
`` okay '' , i tell him . 
`` i be in a rush right_now . 
i know where the car be . 
want me to drive it out '' ? 
`` i 'll have one of the boys get it '' , he say . 
`` it be one of the rules on transients . 
regulars drive out their own cars '' . 
`` make it as snappy as you can , will you '' ? 
i ask . 
`` oh , that be all_right '' , he say . 
`` you 're going_to be a regular . 
you 'll get_in the office_building here . 
you do n't want to lease a place way_out in the sticks . 
you get business where the business be , not where it be n't '' . 
i grin at him , hand him a_couple_of dollars and say , `` by the time you get the parking charge figure up , there should be a cigar in it for you '' . 
i hurry over to the agency heap , jump in , start the motor and be just_in_time to see the car i want to shadow turn to the left . 
i was hold_up a_bit try to make a left turn . 
by the time i 'd make it he be gone . 
traffic be pretty heavy . 
i turn_on the electric bug , and the signal come_in loud and clear . 
i made time and pick_up him up within ten blocks . 
i stay half a block behind him , let lots_of cars keep in between us , listen to the steady beep beep beep . 
after fifteen minutes of traffic driving he turn to the left . 
i could n't see him , but the electric bugging device give steady beeps when it be straight ahead , short half beeps when the car i was follow be to the left , and long drawn-out beeps when it turn to the right . 
if it ever get behind me , the beep turn to a buzz . 
i turn left too_soon and get a signal show that i be still behind him but he be to the right . 
after a while the signal become a buzz and i know he be behind me . 
that mean he 'd park someplace . 
i made a big circle until i locate the car park at the curb in_front of an apartment house . 
i find a parking place half a block away , sit in the car and wait . 
my quarry be in the apartment house for two hours . 
then he come_out and start drive toward the beach . 
by this time it be dark . 
i could get up close_to him where there be traffic but have to drop_behind far behind when there be n't traffic . 
my lights would have be a giveaway if i 'd try to shadow him in the conventional manner . 
moreover , i 'd have lose him if it had n't be for the electronic shadowing device . 
his signal was come loud and clear and_then all_of_a_sudden it turn to a buzz . 
i circle the block and find he be in the parking_lot of a high-class restaurant . 
i sit where i could watch the exit and realize i be hungry . 
i sit there with the faint odor of charcoal-broiled steaks tantalize my nostrils and occasionally catch the aroma of coffee . 
my man come_out an hour later , drive to the beach , turn right and after half a mile go to the swim and tan_motel . 
it be a fairly modern motel with quite a_bit of electrical display in_front . 
i remember it be the peeping_tom place . 
i wait until my man was come_out of the office with the key to a cabin before i go_in to register . 
the card the man i was shadow had fill_out be still on the counter . 
i notice that he be in unit 12 and that he had register under the name of oscar_l._palmer and wife , give a san_francisco address . 
he had write out the license_number of his car but had transpose the last two figures , an old dodge which be still good . 
ninety-nine times_out of a_hundred the motel manager does n't check the license_number on the plates against the license_number the tenant write out . 
if he does , it 's still better than an even_chance he won n't notice the transposition of the numbers , and if he should notice it , the thing can be pass_off as an honest mistake . 
i use the alias of robert_c._richards , give the first three letters and the first_and_last figure of the license_number on the agency heap , but a_couple_of phony numbers in_between . 
i could have write anything . 
the manager of the motel be a woman who apparently did n't care . 
she was comply with the law in regard_to registrations but she certainly was n't check license_numbers or bother the tenants . 
`` you mean you be all alone , mr._richards '' ? 
`` that be right '' . 
`` your wife is n't going_to join you - later '' ? 
`` i do n't think so '' . 
`` if you expect her to show_up '' , she say , `` you 'd better put ' and wife ' on there . 
it be a formality , you know '' . 
`` any difference in the rate '' ? 
i ask . 
`` not to you '' , she say smile . 
`` it be ten dollars either way . 
there be ice_cubes in a container at the far end and in another by the office . 
there are three soft-drink vending_machines , and if you should be join by - anybody - try to keep things quiet , if you will . 
we like to run a nice quiet place '' . 
`` thank_you '' , i tell her . 
i take another sidelong glance at the other registration card , then take the key to unit 13 that she had give me and go_down long enough to park the car . 
the construction be reasonably solid ; not like the cracker-box construction of so many_of the motel units that have stucco all_over the outside but walls that be thin enough so you can hear every movement of the people in the adjoining apartment . 
i put a small electric amplifier against the wall on_the_side i want to case . 
with the aid of_that i could hear my man move around , hear him cough a_couple_of times , hear the toilet flush , hear the sound of water run . 
whoever his companion was going_to be , she was going_to join him later . 
she know where to come . 
he did n't have_to telephone . 
i be so hungry my stomach feel all lines of communication had been sever . 
it 's one thing to go without food when you 're occupy with some work or when you 're simply postpone a meal , but when you be dependent_on someone else and know that you can n't eat until he 's bed_down for the night , hunger can be a gnawing torture . 
i had notice a drive-in down the road a quarter of a mile . 
the batteries on the bugging device i had put on the car be still fresh enough to send_out good strong signals . 
the powerful microphone i could press against the wall between my motel unit and that occupy by the man would bring_in the sound of any conversation , and i be positively nauseated i be so hungry . 
i get_in the car , drive down to the drive-in and order a_couple_of hamburgers with everything_included , a cup of coffee and the fastest service possible . 
the place be n't particularly busy at_that_time of night , and the girl who was wait on me , who was clothe in the tightest-fitting pair of slacks i had ever see on a woman and a sweater that show everything there be - and there be lots_of it - want to be sociable . 
`` you really in a hurry , handsome '' ? she ask . 
`` i be in a hurry , beautiful '' . 
`` it 's early in the evening to be in a hurry . 
there 's lots_of time left '' . 
`` there may not be any women left '' , i say . 
she give a_little pout and say , `` i do n't get_off work until eleven o ' clock . 
that be when my evening commence '' . 
`` i 'll be here at ten-fifty-five '' , i say . 
`` oh , you ! '' she announce . 
`` that be what they all say . 
what 's that thing go buzz-buzz-buzz in your car '' ? 
i say `` darn it , that be the automatic signal that show when the ignition_key be on . 
i did n't turn_off it off '' . 
i reach over and switch_off the electronic bugging device . 
she go_in to get the hamburgers , and i switch_on the device again and keep the signal from dowling 's car come_in steady and clear until i see her start back with the hamburgers . 
then i shut_off the device again . 
she want to hang_around while i was eat . 
`` do n't you think it be selfish to have dinner before you go to pick_up her up '' ? 
`` no '' , i say . 
`` it be a kindness to her . 
you see , she be on a diet . 
she 'll eat just a pineapple and cottage_cheese salad and i 'm to have one with her so she won n't feel out of place '' . 
`` diets can be terrible '' , the girl say . 
`` how much overweight be she '' ? 
`` not a_bit '' , i say , `` but she 's keep her figure in_hand '' . 
she look at me provocatively . 
`` good figures should be keep in_hand '' , she say , and walk away with an exaggerated wiggle . 
i turn_on the device again , half fearful that i might find silence , but the buzzes come_in loud and clear . 
when i switch_on the lights for her to come and get the check , i have the exact change plus a dollar tip . 
the fat man say , `` all we gotta do is go around the corner '' . 
the gun move . 
the thin man say , `` that-a-way '' . 
`` - second building on the right '' . 
`` - it say police right_on the door '' . 
`` - so even if we be as dumb as you take us for , we could still find it '' . 
roberta and dave begin to back toward the door . 
the thin man wave the gun again . 
he say , `` right around the corner '' . 
`` it say water works , but there be a policeman on_duty , too '' . 
`` a night policeman just like in the states . 
you know '' ? 
`` canada does n't have much of_this here juvenile_delinquency problem , but we keep a night policeman all_the_same on account of the crazy tourists '' . 
at the door , dave pause to feel for the latch . 
roberta glance up at her husband . 
he was going_to be sensible and not try to do anything rash with_that gun point at him . 
she measure the distance from_where they stand to the men and the gun , measure the distance from the men to_the_back room . 
she decide to risk it . 
there was something phony about all this gun waving - something not_quite what it seem in the detailed directions for find the police . 
dave have the latch under his thumb now and he remove his arm from his wife in_order_to pull the door open . 
in_a_flash she be away to_the_back , pay_attention no attention to three angry shouts from the male throats . 
she tear open the back door . 
it be dark inside the room but enough light spill from the restaurant behind her to enable her to make_out a round_table with a green cloth top . 
there be a small sideboard with some empty beer_bottles on_it and perhaps fifteen wooden chairs . 
slowly she turn to face the men again . 
rat-face at the counter be on his feet . 
the distance between where she stand and where dave wait at the outside_door be a_hundred miles . 
keep her frightened gaze on the men at the counter , she begin to feel her way to the door . 
she sidle along the booths one step at_a_time . 
the gun follow her . 
as she reach dave and feel his arm go around her , feel him pull her to the safety of his person , she know with the certainty of despair that something bad had happen to lauren . 
the two men watch as dave close the door behind them , watch them cross the sidewalk to their car . 
it was get light . 
the fat man remove his apron , put_on a greasy and wrinkled jacket , and zip it over his paunch . 
the thin man move swiftly to the phone and dial a number . 
when he was answer , he say , `` albert ? 
vince . 
i 'm send you a_couple_of customers - yeah - just get them out of my hair and keep them out - i do n't give_a_damn what you tell them - only do n't believe a word they say - they be out to make trouble for me and it be up_to you to stop them - i do n't care how - and one more thing - cate 's cafe close at eleven like always last night and rose and clarence_corsi leave for quebec yesterday - some shrine or other - i think it was call saint_simon 's - yeah , yesterday . 
got_it '' ? 
he turn from the phone and stride to the front of the restaurant . 
the white buick had n't move away yet . 
good . 
a line of worry form , a twitch pull his mouth over to one side . 
he say , `` grosse ? 
you ai n't kid me - the kid do n't know the name of_this town '' ? 
`` i ai n't kid you , vince . 
how could she ? 
she musta been walk in her sleep - you see her yourself in here '' . 
`` howda i know '' ? 
`` remember how she look when barney hold the door for her ? 
kinda like a zombie ? 
she was just wake_up when we find her at the garage '' . 
vince swear . 
`` stupid fools - ai n't got enough brains between the two of you '' - 
grosse mutter , his head down , one hand play with the zipper on his jacket . 
`` - have enough brains to call ya up so as ya could do sompin about it when the parents - i coulda let her go go '' - his eyes be lowered , so he could n't have see the narrow , pointed face of his companion suddenly writhe with fury ; but he be aware_of it just the same . 
he know vince_steiner be one of those men who had_to work_up a fury once_in_a_while just to prove how dangerous he could be . 
with a curse , vince seize the thing nearest , a glass sugar container with a spouted metal top , and throw it against the wall opposite . 
the heavy glass did n't break , but the top fly off ; sugar spray with a hiss that be loud in the silence . 
not really startled , but careful to appear so , grosse suck noisily on his pipe . 
vince curse steadily . 
`` why does everything have_to happen to me '' ? 
grosse quietly get a broom and start to sweep up the sugar . 
vince watch him . 
his mouth work over the profanity , the obscenities in his vocabulary . 
once he say , `` why ' n hell did n't you look in_the_back seat of the car before you drive off ? 
do n't you and barney ever use your brains '' ? 
the fat man did n't answer . 
he get one of the menus and brush the spilled sugar onto it and carry it to a box on the floor behind the counter . 
he return the menu to its place between catchup bottle and paper napkin dispenser . 
he speak soothingly . 
`` she do n't know nothing about them cars . 
she think she be in a ordinary garage '' . 
`` how do you know , stupid ? 
and put_back cate 's gun back '' . 
`` i know '' . 
grosse tuck the gun under_the_counter . 
`` - one word of_this get to guardino '' - 
`` who 's tell guardino '' ? 
vince swear again . 
`` you get that kid over to rose 's house '' . 
the fat man wince . 
he run a finger down his cheek , trace the scratch there . 
`` why can n't i leave her locked_up in the tool crib '' ? 
the thin man stop his pacing long enough to glance at the clock . 
`` you and barney get her over to rose 's before it get too light . 
after guardino 's leave , we 'll dump the kid somewhere near the border where she kin get home . 
god help you if she know where she 's be '' . 
grosse spread his hands . 
`` what am i going_to do with her all day ? 
in the tool crib she can n't get_away '' . 
`` what the hell do i care what you do with her all day ? 
just get her where guardino won n't see her and start ask questions '' . 
grosse swear now . 
`` dammit all , vince . 
i be n't no baby sitter '' . 
vince shout finally , `` get her over to rose 's and i 'll come_by and see that she stay_put '' . 
grosse rub the bridge of his nose where it be swollen . 
he speak sullenly . 
`` you do n't hafta get nasty . 
i wish you luck when you try scare that kid '' . 
suddenly he grin . 
his voice lose its sullen tones and he chuckle . 
`` i got one question '' . 
`` what be it '' ? 
impatiently . 
`` be you a poor dumb canadian or a smart_aleck from the states '' ? 
vince lift his hand as if to strike , but his thin lips spread in a smile . 
grosse duck and snigger . 
`` where 'd you say you be_born '' ? 
`` in a chicago slum just like you . 
and i ai n't go_back there on account of one lousy kid '' . 
lauren_landis rub her face against the blanket . 
she had cry a_little because she be frightened . 
she could easily understand why the two men had be startled to find a strange girl in_the_back seat of their car ( she had figure_out that out ) , but she could n't understand their subsequent actions . 
was it because she had show panic ? 
who could blame her for that ? 
it be one thing to awaken outside a restaurant where your parents were eat and quite another to awaken in a strange garage and know your parents had go_on home without you . 
she be glad the fat man had leave . 
barney be not really frightening . 
she jump as the little man now appear at the window and , reach through the opening , offer her a bottle of coke . 
she smile at him wetly . 
although she find she be thirsty , she be about to refuse ( never , never take candy from a strange man ) when she see the bottle be unopened . 
he place a bottle_opener on the counter . 
so , he understand her panic . 
she blow her nose on a tissue and open the coke bottle . 
it be icy cold and taste delicious . 
she feel a lift in spirit . 
when she be finished she push it back . 
the man be busy do something to the inside of the door-frame on the driver 's side of a car . 
she call softly , `` barney '' . 
he look in her direction but he did n't answer . 
she say , `` barney , why is he keep me here '' ? 
still no answer . 
he seem to be look at a point above the little window . 
lauren say , `` why can n't i call my home ? 
or borrow some money from someone and go_home by bus ? 
i could send the money right back '' . 
barney finish the cigarette he had been smoke . 
he drop it and carefully grind it to nothing with the sole of his heavy shoe . 
now he look at her . 
he say , `` i only work here '' . 
lauren say , `` please '' ? 
but he be back at_work on a car . 
she drop her head on her arms on the counter . 
how could he be kind one moment and cruel the next ? 
did he know something that make him feel sad and sorry_for her ? 
and be he afraid to do anything as definite as release her ? 
her heart was thump painfully ; the unknown be so_much worse than - what dangers lie ahead for her ? 
what awful thing had she to face in the next few hours ? 
something wet and hot was trickle on her wrists . 
tears ? 
with a sturdy act of will she turn her mind away from herself ; as long as she could do nothing constructive about the situation she be in , she would think_about something else . 
her mother and father , for_instance . 
where be they now ? 
in her mind she follow the white buick along the road somewhere between here and the niagara_river . 
her father 's attention would be on the road ahead and it would n't deviate an inch until he cross the bridge at the falls and take the river_road to lasalle and , finally , turn_in at their own driveway at 387 heather_heights . 
then he would yawn and stretch and shout , `` all out . 
this be the end of the line '' . 
and what would her mother be do right_now ? 
her mother would be fast asleep curled_up against that wonderful , big , safe , solid shoulder next to her on the front seat . 
lauren_landis be in_trouble and she be alone . 
roberta_landis put her hand on her husband 's arm as he slide in the driver 's seat beside her . 
somewhere birds were sweetly call , were answer . 
her teeth chatter so_that she make three attempts at speech before she become intelligible . 
`` dave . 
i see that woman 's apron behind the door . 
there be a wet spot - she could n't have be gone long '' . 
dave make some sound mean to convey agreement . 
he insert the car key in the lock . 
roberta was violently tremble . 
she stammer , `` you hear what he say about police ? 
why do n't we drive around the corner '' ? 
the car_door crash shut . 
the engine throb into life . 
dave say , `` i get the message . 
we 're go '' . 
roberta say , `` no . 
you go . 
walk . 
suppose lauren come look_for us ? 
i can sit here in the car while you walk around the corner '' . 
the big car spring away from the curb like something alive . 
he say , `` i 'm not going_to leave my wife and my car out here in_sight of those '' - 
roberta glance at him and stop tremble . 
his jowls were spiked by barbs of graying beard . 
his small , mean eyes regard marty steadily , unblinkingly . 
his eyes were thread by little filaments of red as if tiny veins had burst and flood blood into them . 
as he chew his gum and exude wheezing breath , marty smell the reek of bad whiskey . 
marty recognize the man . 
he had drive the car that pass them on_the_road outside admassy 's place . 
this be acey_squire , proprietor of the juke joint . 
marty smile at squire pleasantly and say , `` there was a cab wait for me here . 
do you know where it might have go '' ? 
squire chew his gum , his jaw move in a steady rhythm . 
he look straight at marty . 
he did not answer . 
marty scan the faces of the others nearest him , look into their staring eyes . 
`` did anyone see my cab '' ? he ask , keep his voice casual . 
he avoid show any surprise or annoyance when no one answer him . 
`` i have to get_back to jarrodsville '' , he go_on . 
`` i see there be some cars here . 
i wonder if one of you gentlemen could drive me back to town ? 
i 'd be happy to pay for the favor , of_course '' . 
the seventeen men stand and stare at him for a moment longer . 
and_then a startling thing occur . 
it be so utterly unexpected that marty stand for several moments with his mouth hang open foolishly after it had happen . 
there was no word speak , no apparent signal give . 
yet the men all move at the same instant . 
they pile into the waiting cars , motors roar , the cars speed off . 
the station_wagon and the old plymouth head east toward jarrodsville . 
the ford and the pickup_truck speed west toward sanford 's run . 
in seconds all four cars be out_of_sight . 
marty_land stand alone on a red-clay road as storm_clouds gather ominously in_the_sky again . 
from a_great_distance thunder growl and break the silence . 
land look_back toward the dilapidated house . 
he think he see a pale face at a window . 
perhaps it be dora_may . 
perhaps she would be glad that they had n't hurt him . 
there be other farmhouses nearby . 
across the road there be one no_more_than a_hundred yards away . 
there be another on this side , a_little further_down . 
there be many_more between here and jarrodsville . 
telephone_poles line the road . 
they rear tall and mocking . 
their wires stretch out into infinity . 
not a single strand of wire reach_into the silent houses beside the red-clay road . 
there was nothing he could do but walk . 
and jarrodsville be more_than three miles away , down an old dirt road that the rain had turn_into a quagmire . 
marty face east and start walk down the left side of the road . 
after he had proceed a_few feet , he pause and turn_up the cuffs of his trousers , which be already damp and mud-caked . 
the viscous mud be ankle-deep , and in places great puddles spread across the road and reflect the murky light . 
as he approach the first farmhouse , thunder sound behind him again , closer now and louder , like a steadily advancing drum corps . 
there be several people on the porch of the farmhouse . 
there be a very old_man and a young_woman and a brood of children range from toddlers to teen-agers . 
for just an instant he think_of appeal_to them for help . 
perhaps they have a car or truck and would drive him into town . 
then he realize the utter futility of the idea . 
they were stare at him in the same blank and menacing way that the men outside the gate had stare . 
even the eyes of the smallest children seem malicious . 
on his side of the road there be two farm hands , well back in a field , lean_against a plow . 
they , too , stare at him . 
the drums of thunder be right behind him now . 
a foolish thought come into his head . 
he remember a story he had read as a youth . 
it be probably one of kipling 's tales of the_british army . 
it concern an officer who had been disgrace and drum_out . 
the steady roll of the drums had sound behind him as he walk between the endless ranks of the men he had command , and each man about-face and turn his back as the officer approach . 
marty wish these poor farm people would turn their backs . 
the fencing by the roadside end . 
now the dirt highway was border on either side by a fairly deep drainage_ditch , too broad to leap over unless you be an olympic star . 
the day 's rain had been add to the stagnant water . 
he was trap on_the_road when he hear the sound of an approaching car . 
it was come toward him . 
the car be now in_sight . 
marty 's heart skip a beat when he recognize it . 
it be the station_wagon that had pass his cab on_the_road , the station_wagon that had be parked at the burch farm . 
acey_squire 's station_wagon . 
it had head back toward jarrodsville . 
that had only be a ruse to lure him out on the deserted road . 
now acey and his friends were return to seek_out him out . 
the station_wagon come to a stop a_couple_of hundred feet in_front of him , beside a fenced field . 
then there be another sound . 
a second car was come from the west , from the direction of sanford 's run . 
it be the ford that had be outside burch 's farm . 
marty look helplessly in both directions . 
it be a narrow road , barely wide enough for two cars to pass . 
he could not leave the road because of the water-filled drainage_ditch . 
when the two cars be equidistant from him , the station_wagon start_up again and the ford gather speed . 
they bear_down_on him . 
there was nothing he could do except jump into the ditch . 
he jump , and sink to his knees in muddy water . 
as the two cars roar by , there be a high-pitched eerie , nerve-shattering sound . 
marty know how the union soldiers must have feel at chancellorsville and antietam and gettysburg when the ragged gray ranks charge at them , scream the wild banshee howl they call the rebel yell . 
for moments he stand in water , shiver and gasp for breath . 
he had turn his ankle slightly , and it pain him . 
the cars , with their load of howling men , had disappear in the distance . 
there had been two more cars parked at the farm , a plymouth and a pickup_truck . 
they would be come for him next , bear_down_on him from both directions . 
and_then the station_wagon and the ford would seek_out him out again . 
he would be harass repeatedly and would escape death by_inches time after time , all_the_way to jarrodsville . 
he still had three miles to go . 
back east the more affluent juvenile_delinquents , who could afford hyped-up autos instead of switch blades as lethal weapons , play this same game and call it `` chicken '' . 
he could not go through the fields . 
that way was bar on both sides of the road by a high barbed-wire fence . 
he have to make for the section of road just ahead that was border by the rail_fence , the section by the farmhouse . 
at_least he could climb_up on_the_fence when his tormenters roar by again . 
the admassy place could not be far now . 
he would go_in there , climb through the window , and at_least be safe for a_little while and able to rest . 
there was even a bare chance that the phone had not been disconnect . 
he did not dare climb back up to the road . 
he be deep in water , but at_least they could not reach him there . 
he splash on , mud suck at his feet with each step , until he reach the end of the drainage_ditch and the beginning of the fence that enclose the farm . 
he climb back to the road , and he feel utterly exhausted . 
he stand , pant , for a moment . 
and_then he see something that he had not see before , and panic grip him again . 
the fence , his only refuge when the metal death come roar at him , was make of rails , all_right , but the rails were protect by a thick screening of barbed_wire that would rip his flesh if he press against it . 
he lurch on down the road despairingly , because there was no place else to go . 
he lose all sense of dignity . 
you could not stand on dignity when you be soaked and muddied and your life be at stake . 
probably people were watch him from the porch or from behind the windows of_this farmhouse , too , but he did not bother to look . 
he break_into a dogtrot , breathe heavily , stream with sweat . 
he have to reach admassy 's place . 
it be his only sanctuary . 
the fences on both sides of the road bristle with the barbed_wire . 
the fences stretch on endlessly . 
and_then he hear them . 
and now he see them . 
the plymouth was come at him from the east , the pickup_truck from the west . 
they had time it better this time . 
they would reach him at almost exactly the same instant . 
he stop stone-still . 
if he back against the fence , one of the cars would brush him as it pass , and he would be cruelly lacerate by the wire . 
he stumble to the middle of the road and simply stand there , wait for them , a perfect target . 
the cars must have had their gas pedals push_down to the floor_boards . 
they were come_on at reckless speed for such old vehicles . 
they thunder at him . 
he hold his arms close_to his sides and make himself as small as possible . 
when the plymouth near , it veer toward him and seem about to run_down him down . 
he force himself to stay frozen there . 
if he move , he would be in the path of the other car . 
he think the fender of the plymouth brush his jacket as it go_by . 
in a fraction of a second the pickup_truck hurtle by on the other side . 
the weird , insane sound of the rebel yell reverberate again and echo from the distant hills . 
he did not leave the middle of the road . 
he did not try to run . 
he trudge on , his aching eyes focus straight ahead . 
he was near the admassy house . 
he was going_to make_it , he tell himself . 
and_then he hear a car come from the east , and he feel as if he would break_down and weep . 
`` oh , no , not again '' , he say aloud . 
`` not again so soon '' . 
there be a new sound , a sound as piercing as the rebel yell , yet different . 
it be the sound of a siren . 
now he see that the approaching car be painted white , and he begin to wave his arms frantically . 
it be the prowl_car from the sheriff 's office . 
the car draw_up alongside him and stop . 
`` get_in '' , charley_estes say brusquely . 
he stagger into the back seat and lie back , fight for breath . 
there be someone in_front with the sheriff . 
it be pete_holmes , the cabdriver . 
pete turn_around and say to marty , `` i guess you think i be a yellow-bellied hound . 
but there be n't no use in me stay there . 
i could n't fight a dozen or_so of ' em . 
if i 'd stay , all that i 'd have_got be four punctured tires and one busted head . 
why did n't you wait at the burch house ? 
you must 've know i 'd go to get the sheriff . 
i be lucky they let me go , i guess '' . 
the sheriff be occupied with maneuver the car around in a very narrow space . 
when it was finally point east , he say , `` you should never have come out here alone . 
this be redneck country . 
every man in every one of these houses be a night_rider . 
then he turn_over the telephone over to rourke , and go_into the bedroom to change his slippers for dry socks and shoes . 
rourke was talk on the phone when he come_back . 
`` about an hour , eh ? 
are you positive '' ? 
he listen a moment and_then say , `` hold_it '' . 
he turn his head and say , `` alvarez will definitely be in a back_room at the jai_alai club on south_beach within an hour . 
want to try and meet him there '' ? 
shayne look at his watch . 
that be n't too far from fifth_street , and should allow him to make scotty 's bar by midnight . 
he say with satisfaction , `` that 's fine , tim . 
i 'll be there '' . 
rourke confirm the appointment over the phone and hang_up . 
`` i do n't know what you 're get_into , mike '' , he say unhappily . 
`` i hope to christ '' . 
shayne say briskly , `` grab another drink if you want it . 
we 've get one other call to make before i meet alvarez '' . 
`` where '' ? 
`` it be out in the northeast section . 
have_got you got my car here '' ? 
`` it be parked in_front '' . 
rourke hastily slop whiskey into his glass on top of half-melted ice-cubes . 
`` i 'd better keep_on drive yours '' , shayne decide , `` because i 'll be go_on over to the beach . 
i can drop you back here to pick_up mine up '' . 
he go_to a closet to get a light jacket , and take his hat from beside the door . 
timothy_rourke gulp down the whiskey hastily and join him , ask , `` who are we going_to call on in the northeast section '' ? 
`` a lady . 
that_is , maybe not too_much of a lady . 
at_least , i want to find_out whether she be home yet or not '' . 
he open the door and follow rourke out . 
in rourke 's car , shayne drive east to biscayne_boulevard and north toward felice_perrin 's address which had been give to him by the peralta governess . 
as he drive , he fill_in timothy_rourke briefly on the events of the evening after leave the reporter to go_to the peralta house , and on_his_own surmises . 
`` i want to be in scotty 's bar at midnight when marsha make her phone_call there '' , he end grimly . 
`` i do n't know whether that threatening letter of hers have anything to do with this situation or not , but i want to see who take the call '' . 
`` this deal at las_putas_buenas where the two knife-men jump you '' , say rourke with interest , `` that sound like it was set_up with malice aforethought by the luscious mrs._peralta , does n't it '' ? 
`` it does '' , shayne grunt sourly , still able to taste her mouth on his in the green_jungle parking_lot . 
`` that story of hers about an unsigned note direct her to be there tonight sound completely phony . 
if it was design to put me on_the_spot , it would have_to have been write before peralta ever call_in me in on the case '' . 
`` do you think laura did have the counterfeit bracelet make without her husband 's knowledge '' ? 
`` i have n't the faintest idea . 
i think her husband strongly suspect so , and that be why he call_in me in on the thing in direct defiance of his confederates and almost certainly without tell them why he was doing so . 
be n't this felice 's street '' ? 
shayne ask , peer ahead at the partially obscured street_sign . 
rourke could see it better out the right-hand side , and he say , `` yes . 
turn to the left , i think , for that number you give me . 
not more_than a block or_so '' . 
shayne get_in the left-hand lane and cut_across the boulevard divider . 
there be a small , neon-lighted restaurant and cocktail_lounge on the southeast corner of the intersection as he turn into the quiet , palm-lined street where most_of the houses on both sides be older two-story mansions , now cut_up into furnished rooms and housekeeping apartments . 
shayne drive westward from the boulevard slowly , let rourke crane his head out the window and watch for street numbers . 
a single automobile be parked half-way up the block on the left-hand side . 
shayne note idly that it carry miami_beach license_plates as he approach , and_then see the flare of a match in the front seat as they pass , indicate that it be occupied . 
he turn to see the briefly-illumed faces of two men in the parked car just_as rourke say , `` it be the next house , mike . 
on_the_right '' . 
instead of pull into the curb , shayne increase his speed slightly to the corner where he swing left . 
he go around the corner and park , turn_off his lights and motor . 
`` i tell you , mike '' , say rourke in an aggrieved voice . 
`` it be back there '' . 
shayne say , `` i know it be , tim '' . 
his voice be chilling and cold . 
`` did you see the car park across the street '' ? 
`` i did n't notice it . 
i was watch for numbers '' . 
`` it have a beach license , tim . 
two men in the front seat . 
i get_a_look a quick look at their faces as we go_past . 
unless i be crazy as hell , they be two of painter 's dicks . 
a couple named harris and geely . 
those names mean anything to you '' ? 
`` wait a minute , mike . 
in painter 's office this_evening '' . 
shayne nod grimly . 
`` the pair whom petey is officially commend for slap me around and pull_in me in '' . 
`` what are they do here '' ? 
`` a stake-out , i suppose . 
on felice_perrin . 
maybe with specific orders to see that i do n't make contact with her . 
i be not positive , tim . 
i may be wrong . 
i 'll slide out and walk_around the block back to the cocktail_lounge on biscayne . 
you drive on and circle back and pull_up beside them parked there . 
you be a reporter , and you 're look_for miss_perrin to interview her . 
make them show their hands . 
if they be beach cops on a stake-out , they 'll admit it to a reporter . 
they 've have_got no official standing on this side of the bay . 
as soon as you find_out if they be geely and harris , come on around to the lounge where i 'll be wait '' . 
shayne open the door on his side and step_out . 
timothy_rourke groan dismally as he slide under the wheel . 
`` the things you talk_into me into , mike '' . 
shayne chuckle . 
`` how often do they add_up to headlines ? 
you should complain '' . 
he cross the street and walk swiftly southward to circle back to the boulevard and north a block to the open restaurant . 
he was stand at the end of the bar enjoy a slug of cognac when rourke come_in six or eight minutes later . 
the reporter nod as he move up beside him at the bar . 
shayne tell the bartender , `` bourbon and water '' , and rourke tell him , `` it 's those two , all_right . 
harris and geely . 
i make them show me their identification before i could be persuade not to call on felice_perrin '' . 
shayne say happily , `` i 've got it all work_out , tim . 
take your time with your drink . 
i 'll beat_it . 
in exactly three minutes , go_in that phone_booth behind you and call police_headquarters . 
be excited and do n't identify yourself . 
just say that a_couple_of drunks are have a hell of a fight down the street , and they better send a patrol_car . 
then hang_up fast and come walk on down to the perrin address . 
i 'll be wait for you there '' . 
the bartender bring rourke 's drink and shayne lay a twenty-dollar bill on the bar . 
he say in_a_low_voice , `` i 've have_got a date with a lady , mister . 
will that pay for a pint i can take with me . 
you know how it be '' , he add with a conspiratorial wink . 
`` candy be dandy , but liquor be quicker and you do n't have any candy for_sale here anyhow '' . 
`` we sure do n't '' . 
the bartender wink back at him and palm the bill . 
he turn_away and return in_a_moment with a pint of brandy in a small paper sack which he slide over the counter to shayne . 
as the detective slide it into his pocket , rourke ask sadly , `` what in hell are you going_to do , mike '' ? 
`` make a_couple_of punk detectives named geely and harris wish to god they 'd stay out of my way this afternoon . 
three minutes , tim '' . 
shayne stride out blithely , and rourke check his watch and sip his drink , get a dime ready_to make the telephone_call to the police . 
outside , shayne hesitate when he see that rourke had park his coupe directly in_front of the bar headed south . 
he walk over to the right-hand door , open it and get the reloaded automatic out of the glove_compartment and put it in his hip_pocket . 
he hope he would n't be force to use it in take_care of the beach detectives , but its weight be comforting at his hip . 
on this side of the bay , miami_beach cops have no_more legal_rights than any ordinary citizen , and shayne 's pistol permit be just_as good as theirs . 
he go swiftly up the sidewalk toward the parked car with the two beach detectives in the front seat . 
he tug the brim of his hat low as he approach , step out into the street just behind the car and stride around to the right-hand side . 
the big , paunchy man named geely be on that side , half-turned in the seat toward his hatchet-faced companion so_that his back partially rest against the closed door . 
shayne turn the handle and jerk the door open before either of the men be quite aware_of his presence in the night . 
geely grunt and slide partly out , and shayne 's left arm snake in around his neck to help him , while he set himself solidly on the roadway and swing his right fist to the big , gum-chewing jaw before geely could straighten_up . 
shayne step back to let him slump to the ground , and_then dive over him through the open_door into harris who was curse loudly and try to drag a gun from a shoulder_holster , somewhat impede by the steering_wheel . 
shayne lock his big_hands around harris ' thin neck and drag him out over the seat into the roadway . 
he hit him once on the sharp point of his chin and feel the body go limp . 
he drop him into the street a_couple_of feet away from geely 's recumbent figure and stare down at both of them for a moment before kick the big man lightly in the side . 
he did n't stir . 
they were both breathe heavily , out_cold , and shayne did n't think either of them had recognize him or could describe him . 
he get the pint of liquor out of his pocket and unscrew the top , sprinkle the pungent stuff liberally over both men , and_then toss the open bottle in on the front seat . 
he turn , then , to look toward the lighted boulevard , and see rourke 's tall , emaciated figure come_out of the lounge and hurriedly start to angle across the street toward the opposite side . 
shayne stroll across to intercept the reporter in_front of the two-story house where felice_perrin live , and ask casually , `` get the police okay '' ? 
`` sure . 
say they 'd have a patrol_car here fast . 
let 's get inside . 
what happen with you '' ? 
`` why the two damned fools get all excited when they see the bottle , and knock_out each other out_cold '' , shayne say good-humoredly . 
`` they 'll have fun explain that to the miami cops . 
got no business over_here on a stake-out anyway '' . 
they go_up onto a front_porch and into a small hallway where a dim bulb burn high in the ceiling . 
a row of mailboxes along the wall have numbers and names on them . 
shayne find one marked perrin 2 - a . 
the stairway on_the_right be dark , but there be a wall-switch at the bottom which light another dim bulb at the top , and they go_up . 
there were two front_rooms , both dark behind their transoms , and there be no sound or light in the entire house to indicate that any of the occupants be awake . 
eight , nine steps above him , roberts had pause . 
mickey pause with him , wait , no_longer impatient , try now to think_out it out , do a_little planning . 
he look down over the banister at the hotel desk , with the telephone and pen set . 
if i could call_in , they could check the story while we be on our way . 
i would n't have_to tell them i have roberts - 
then he hear it , like a muffled thud , feel a subtle change in air_pressure . 
he glance up in_time to see roberts hurtle down on him from above , literally fly through the air , his bloody face twisted . 
mickey try to flatten against the banister , grip it with one hand , but roberts ' full weight strike him at that moment in the groin . 
he gasp for air and the impact tear his hand from the rail . 
he tumble with roberts , helpless and in agony , over_and_over , down the steps . 
by a wrenching effort , he manage to hunch and draw_in , to take the final fall on his back and shoulders rather_than his head . 
he be fuzzy in his mind and , for a moment , helpless on the lobby floor , but he be conscious , and free_of the weight of roberts ' body . 
when his vision clear he see the taller one scramble upward , reach . 
mickey be on his knees when roberts turn on the stairs and the razor flash in his hand . 
he feel his empty pocket and know that roberts had retrieve the only weapon at_hand . 
mickey 's eyes fix on the other 's feet , which would first betray the moment and direction of an attack . 
he rise stiffly , force his knees to lock . 
the knifelike pain in his groin nearly bring him down again . 
he make himself back_off slowly , his eyes wary on roberts , who now have no_more to lose than he . 
the pain dull as he move , and he steady inside . 
after a moment he extend one hand , the fingers curled . 
`` come_on '' , he say . 
`` you want to be that big a fool - i was hope for this '' . 
roberts brush at his eyes with his free hand and start down the steps . 
he hold the razor well out to one side . 
he be invulnerable to attack , but he could be handle , mickey know , if he could be bring to make the first move . 
they be eight feet apart when roberts clear the last step . 
mickey wait with slack arms . 
`` any time , roberts '' , he say . 
`` or would it be easier if i put my hands in my pockets '' ? 
the taunt was lose on roberts . 
he advance slowly , directly , give no hint of a feint to either side . 
he be just short of arm 's reach when he stop . 
mickey back_off two steps , force him to come_on again . 
there be a fixed grin on roberts ' face , make hideous by the swollen nose and the smeared blood . 
mickey back_off again and roberts hesitate , then come along . 
they move in a series of rhythmic fits and starts , a macabre dance - two steps back , two steps forward , two steps back . 
mickey feel his shoulders come_up against the wall beside the heavy slab front_door . 
this was going_to be it now , any second , and what he had to remember be to keep his eye on the razor , no_matter what , even if roberts should feint with a kick to the groin , the deadly hand be his exclusive concern . 
the kick come , sudden and vicious but short . 
mickey 's guts twist with the effort , but he keep his eye on the weapon . 
it move in a silver arc toward his throat , then veer downward . 
he hunch his left shoulder into it and slash at roberts ' forearm with his own , feel the blade slide off his sleeve . 
before roberts could move inside to cut upward toward his face , he slam his right fist into roberts ' belly . 
roberts sag and slash at him wildly . 
duck , mickey trip and fall to one side , land heavily on the wood floor . 
then roberts be on him , gasp for breath and for a_couple_of seconds mickey lose sight of the blade . 
he feel it rip at the side of his jacket and a momentary sting under his left ribs . 
he get a knee up into roberts ' belly , use both hands and heave him clear , then scramble to his feet . 
they be in_the_center of the lobby now . 
still clutch the razor , roberts come_up into a crouch , shake his head . 
when he charge mickey be ready . 
he hit roberts with his left fist in the ribs and the razor cut toward him feebly , then wobble in mid-air . 
with his right fist , and nearly all his weight behind it , he smash at the bloodstained face . 
roberts careen backward , his back arched , fight for balance and , fail , stumble against the newel_post at the foot of the stairs . 
the sound of his head strike the solid wood be an ultimate , sudden-end sound . 
he fall on his side across the lowest step , roll_over once , then lie still . 
mickey find himself lean_against the desk , with stiff hands , pant for breath . 
after a minute he go to roberts , look at one of his eyes and feel for a pulse . 
he could n't feel any . 
roberts appear to be dead ; if_not yet , then soon , very soon . 
suddenly it be cold in the lobby . 
it seem to him that a long_time had pass before he decide what to do . 
actually it be no_more_than eight or ten minutes , and the sum of his reasoning come to this : 
there 's no way to take him in now and keep those other two - wister and the one who hire the two of them - from find_out about roberts and lam out . 
the local law here would hold me till they check clear back home , and maybe more_than that . 
they would have to . 
by then they could never catch_up_with the others . 
there 's no other way ; i 'll have to do it myself . 
he look at where roberts lie sprawled on the step . 
mickey be sure now he be dead . 
one thing , he think , nobody know about it yet . 
only me . 
he climb the stairs , go_into roberts ' room , find a suitcase and pack as much into it as he could . 
he leave a_few things . 
it did n't have_to be perfect . 
roberts be a wastrel . 
walk away on impulse , he might logically leave_behind what it be inconvenient to carry . 
when he had close the suitcase he find a rag and move about the room , wipe carefully everything he might have touch . 
it take him nearly an hour . 
he go_to the room he had rent and get_into his overcoat . 
he leave the rest of his things and return to the lobby . 
he set roberts ' suitcase near the front_door , go outside and walk back to the garage . 
he be mildly surprised to find it was snow . 
it snow softly , silently , an undulating interruption of his vision against the night sky . 
he could feel it on his face and in his hair . 
he find the key to the jeep , get it start and warm_up it up for five minutes . 
then he back_out and swing around to the front drive . 
he go_into the hotel and search till he find the razor . 
he put it in his own pocket for safekeeping . 
he take the suitcase out to the jeep and put it in the front seat . 
then he go_back for roberts . 
the body be heavier than he had anticipate . 
he get it onto his shoulder after some work and carry it outside and down to the jeep . 
he dump it into the back and make sure it would n't roll out , then return to the porch and close the front_door , make sure it be unlocked . 
he drive carefully in the direction of the brief tour they had take earlier . 
it snow continuously , but quietly , evenly . 
when he reach the dip in the woods , he see that already the earlier ruts be barely discernible . 
the jeep fight its way through the low spot and get onto higher ground . 
he drive in low_gear to the fork in the road and swing as_close_as possible to the entrance to the abandoned mine . 
he park face it and leave the headlights on , but when he start into the tunnel with the suitcase , he find the illumination extend no farther than half_a_dozen feet into the passage . 
he go_back and get the flashlight , return to the tunnel and carry the suitcase to the edge of the_pit he had find earlier . 
he toss the bag into the_pit and watch dry dust spray up around it . 
when the dust settle , he go_back to the jeep and carefully work roberts ' body onto his shoulder . 
it be n't like carry the suitcase . 
the soft snow be deceitful underfoot . 
twice he nearly fall . 
inside the passage , he have to work his way over the fallen timber and nearly collapse under his clumsy burden . 
by the time he reach the edge of the_pit he was pant and his shoulder and back ache under the drag of the dead weight . 
he stand look down for a_few seconds , then back_up two or three paces from the edge . 
there be too_much weight casually to toss it away . 
he could feel himself fall in with it and be unable to get_out . 
it would be a bad place to die . 
it be a bad place for roberts to wind_up , but roberts had ask_for it . 
it be too late to worry about that . 
he kneel slowly and dump the corpse onto the floor of the tunnel . 
it be a relief to get_rid_of the weight . 
he was shake with tension and it take him a_couple_of minutes to get his breath and settle down . 
then he get on his knees and roll roberts ' body toward the edge . 
it hang momentarily on the point of drop off . 
he gave it a strong push , hear it slide , then tumble dryly into the hole . 
he get to his feet and throw the flashlight beam into the_pit . 
the body lie in an awkward sprawl twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the tunnel floor . 
deep enough , he decide . 
there was little chance anyone would enter this shaft during the winter . 
the external signs of his approach to_it would be cover by the snow , probably by the next day . 
it be n't cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact . 
by spring it would be a skeleton . 
he make_one's_way his way back to the jeep . 
he had start to back into the turn when he remember the razor in his pocket . 
he climb_down , go_back into the tunnel and toss the razor into the_pit . 
it land on roberts ' sprawled right thigh , poise precariously , then slide off to the ground . 
he go_back once_more to the jeep and start the short drive to the hotel . 
in the garage he check the jeep for signs of the use he had make of_it . 
there were stains here_and_there and he clean them off , use an oiled rag he find on a nail . 
he wipe the steering_wheel and all the places he might have touch the jeep . 
he replace the flashlight where it had been stow , get into his own car and back it out of the garage . 
there be tire marks where it had be , but they were overlap by others and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable except under close scrutiny . 
liz_peabody , he think , might spend some time grieve for her lost lover , but he doubt that she would launch an investigation . 
he judge her to be a woman of some pride , though not_much sense . 
still she would probably have sense enough not to call_in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who , apparently , had run_away . 
he put_in a call to cunningham from his hotel_room . 
the maid answer and he decide nancy must be at_work . 
jeb caution him not to be too hopeful and_then , ignore his own advice , say excitedly , `` but it does sound good . 
a woman named lisa who tell nobody anything about herself . 
that courtyard picture with the same initials '' . 
`` i 'm not exactly jump up and down with_enthusiasm . 
i 'll call you in a day or_so '' . 
on the highway he relax and enjoy the drive over lake_pontchartrain and along the coast . 
gulf_springs be ten miles inland - more of a quaint old coast town than those along the beach make garish by tourist attractions . 
he check_in a motel and drive downtown . 
the courthouse be a white-stucco building minus the customary dome . 
instead of the usual straggling privet hedges and patches of bare dirt in most small-town squares , the building was hem_in by a semitropical growth of camellias and azaleas and a smooth lawn the improbably bright-green shade of florist 's grass . 
he figure his best bet be a call on the sheriff . 
a clerk in the outer office take_in him in to sheriff_carruthers , a big , paunchy man with thick , white hair and a voice with a senatorial resonance which suggest he should be run for higher office . 
seated in_front of the desk , hank say , `` i 'm look_for some information with very little to go_on , sheriff '' . 
he explain the background of the case , end with the tenuous clue which had bring him to gulf_springs . 
the sheriff 's swivel_chair tilt back . 
`` so you 're look_for a woman who marry a man who might have live here a year ago and might have been poison . 
if there was such a person , i be afraid she get_away with_it . 
pity we do n't know more about him . 
i think the best bet be to go_through the society columns of last year and see if any of the grooms match with the obituaries a_little later . 
it 'll be a tedious job , but if you want to try it , the old newspaper files be in the basement here in the county supervisor 's office '' . 
`` maybe the society editor would remember a good-looking out-of-town bride '' . 
`` that be an idea . 
mrs._calhoun has be society editor here for twenty-five years . 
the editor say that marriages may be make in heaven , but weddings are make in mrs._calhoun 's columns . 
she be the one who decide which wedding is to get the lead space in the sunday paper and all that '' . 
he smile . 
`` once , when the editor be just out of the hospital from a gallstone operation , mrs._calhoun and the mother of the bride go_out to his house and fight it out beside his bed . 
she 'd be sure to remember any bride who be vague about background . 
she 'd have make a great scientist dedicated_to track_down heredity and environment . 
she 'd also remember if the groom die later '' . 
he stand_up . 
`` i wish you good_luck , but please do n't dig_up too tough a case for me this close_to election . 
if you find_out anything , come_back on back here and we 'll get_started on_it '' . 
track_down mrs._calhoun be like try to catch_up_with paul_revere between lexington and concord . 
it turn_out that she also sell real_estate , cosmetics , and hospital insurance . 
the wearying trek stretch into the afternoon - from newspaper plant to insurance office to her house and back to the newspaper , where he find her at five o ' clock . 
she be a large woman with a frizzled gray poodle cut and a pencil clamp like a_bit between her teeth while she hunt and peck on an old typewriter . 
it take a_couple_of minutes to run_through her various businesses and get down to the one he want . 
`` last year ? 
well , i do remember one . 
from baton_rouge . 
marry a man named vincent_black . 
i remember her because she did n't want her picture in the paper . 
first bride like that i 've see in twenty-five years '' . 
`` what reason did she give '' ? 
`` say she have a breaking-out on her face - some sort_of allergy - and none of her old pictures be good enough . 
i did n't see her till several days later at the wedding , and her face look like it had never have a blemish on_it . 
but , of_course , you could n't see too well through the veil '' . 
`` be her name lisa_carmody '' ? 
`` now how in hell would i remember that '' ? 
`` never_mind . 
i can look_up it up . 
do they still live here '' ? 
`` i think they move away shortly after they were marry . 
he be a salesman for something or other and must have been transfer . 
i be sure it 'll be in the files . 
we usually run a social note when somebody move away '' . 
he stand_up and thank her . 
`` have they inherit some money or something '' ? she ask with a reportorial gleam in her eye . 
he say vaguely , `` well , it be a_little legal matter , but nothing like that '' . 
he hurry across to the courthouse and catch the sheriff just_as he was leave . 
`` sound like what you be after '' , he say when hank had finish . 
`` come_on , let 's hurry down before they lock_up for the day '' . 
in the basement the sheriff take him to a small , dingy office occupy by a tall , thin man informal in rolled-up shirt sleeves . 
`` mr. ferrell & & & hirey_lindsay , chairman_of_the_board of supervisors . 
mr._ferrell be a private_detective , hirey . 
want to look_up something in the newspaper files , so do n't lock him in here '' . 
`` sure '' , say hirey . 
`` i 'll just leave the door open . 
it latch when you close it , so stay as long as you like '' . 
carruthers cross the room to a metal door with an open grillework in the top half . 
he pull it open . 
`` now do n't shut this door . 
it won't open from inside . 
before we build the new jail , we used_to keep prisoners in here overnight sometimes when the old jail get too crowded . 
hirey treat himself a_lot better than we do prisoners . 
they be a sight more comfortable than the ones in the jail with the cold air from hirey 's air conditioner come_through the grille '' . 
he walk past the sheriff into a windowless room with shelves full_of big , leather-bound volumes from floor to ceiling all_around the walls . 
a metal table and four chairs stand in the center . 
`` they be all here , back to 1865 '' , carruthers tell him . 
`` it 's all_right to smoke , but make sure your cigarettes be out before you leave . 
and , of_course , you know not to take clippings '' . 
`` i 'll leave the air conditioner on for you , mr._ferrell '' , say hirey . 
`` do n't forget to turn_off it off and close the door good so it 'll latch '' . 
hank thank them and promise to observe the rules . 
when they had go , he stand for a minute breathe_in the mustiness of old paper and leather which the busily thrumming air conditioner could n't quite dispel . 
in a tour around the stacks , he find that the earliest volumes begin on_the_left and progress clockwise around the room . 
an old weakness for burrow in records rise_up to tempt him . 
it be , indeed , all here - almost a century . 
from reconstruction to moon rockets . 
but he pull_away from the irrelevant old volumes and walk around to the newer ones . 
last year 's volume be at the top a_couple_of inches below the ceiling . 
near it be a metal ladder on casters attached to the top shelf . 
he pull it over , climb_up , and lift_out the big volume , almost lose his balance from the weight of_it . 
he stagger over and drop it on the table . 
since mrs._calhoun remember only that the marriage had be in the spring , he start to plod through several months . 
he try to turn right to the society page in each one , but interesting stories keep crop_up to distract him . 
at_last he find it in the paper of april 2 . 
it tell him little more_than mrs._calhoun had remember , state that it had be a small , modest wedding compare to some of the others . 
there was a marked contrast in the amount of information on bride and groom . 
mr._black 's life be an open book , so_to_speak , from his birth in jackson , mississippi , through his basketball-playing days at l._s._u. and his attainment of a b._a. degree , which had presumably prepare him for his career as district sales manager for peerless_business machines . 
the one line on the bride say she be miss_lisa_carmody from baton_rouge . 
no mention of new_orleans . 
hank was begin to feel sharp concern for mr._black . 
if mrs._black be who he think she be , mr._black 's peerless selling days might well be over . 
now for their exodus from gulf_springs . 
this time the search take twice_as long , cut_down on his extra reading , for he have to pick through several columns of one - and two-line social notes in each issue . 
he find it in the edition of may 15 . 
the item say mr. and mrs._black had move to jackson , his home town - so the lovely lisa had be with him a year ago . 
next on his program be a call to the jackson office of peerless_business machines to find_out if vincent_black be still with them - or , more specifically , still with us . 
he glance at his watch , see it be only seven , and decide to indulge his weakness now . 
for the next hour he scramble happily up_and_down the ladder , share the excitement of reporters who had see mckinley 's assassination , the iroquois_theater fire in chicago , and the hall-mills trial . 
in_the_middle of the stock_market crash , he hear a slight noise in the outer office . 
he turn_around , see nothing , and decide it must be a mouse . 
something else distract him , yet there be no sound , only tomblike silence . 
then he know it be not sound , but lack of_it . 
the air conditioner was no_longer run . 
he jump up and turn_around to see the metal door close . 
it clang shut as he spring toward it . 
he press his face against the grille . 
`` who 's there '' ? 
the light shine through the grille dimly illumine the office beyond - enough for him to see there be no one there . 
then he hear the outer door close . 
`` hey , come_back '' , he shout . 
he think it must be some damn janitor or cleaning_woman putter_around , figure that hirey had go off and forget to turn_off everything and lock_up . 
then the faint beginnings of fear stir in his mind . 
unless he be stone-blind , the person who 'd just leave could n't have miss see hank through the open_door of the brightly lighted room . 
and even if he 'd somehow miss see him , he would n't have go off and leave the light on and door open in the file room . 
whoever it be had mean to shut_up him up in here , had follow him and wait till the courthouse and square be deserted . 
but why ? 
to search his room at the motel ? 
to come_back later and kill him after the stores had close around the square and everybody had leave ? 
no , they could kill him just_as easy right_now . 
nobody could hear what was go_on in_this underground vault . 
then he hear it and smell it - the steady hissing , the dread , familiar pungency of gas escape . 
it must be come from an upright heater against the far wall in the supervisors ' office . 
until_now , lilac_gaylor and lila_kingsley had be like an anagram which he could unscramble at his own pace and choosing . 
except for those minutes in her room , he had lose touch with her as a reality . 
gaylor 's obsession and cunningham 's chimera-chasing reminiscences had mesmerize him into think_of lila and lilac , separately or together , as a legend . 
they keep drift apart and merge again in his mind like some minute form of life on a microscope slide . 
this be not , for the angel , just a matter of run_through a logical or deductive chain , or decide on some action from some already established premise . 
no_doubt the angels could do that kind_of thing as fast as any computer . 
what gabriel was being ask to do now , however , be to reexamine all his basic_assumptions , make value-judgments on them , and give them new and different powers in his mind to govern his motives . 
this be not wholly a reasoning process - a computer cannot do it all - and even in an angel it take time . 
( or , perhaps , especially in an angel , whose assumptions had mostly been fix millions of years ago . ) 
be reasonably sure of the reason for the long pause , however , did not make it seem any less long to jack . 
he had already become used_to hesperus ' snap back answers to questions almost before jack could get them ask . 
there was nothing he could do but wait . 
the dice were cast . 
at_last gabriel speak . 
`` we misjudge you '' , he say slowly . 
`` we had conclude that no race as ephemeral as yours could have have time to develop a sense of justice . 
of_course we have before_us the example of the great races at the galactic center ; individually they be nearly as mortal as you - the difference does not seem very marked to us , where it exist . 
but they have survive for long periods as races , whereas you be young . 
we shall recommend to them that they shorten your trial period by half . 
`` for_now , it be clear that we be in the wrong . 
you may reclaim your property , and the penalty on hesperus is lift . 
hesperus , you may speak '' . 
`` i did not perceive this essential distinction either , first-born '' , hesperus say at_once , `` i was only practice a concept that jack teach me , called a deal '' . 
`` nevertheless , you be its agent . 
jack , what be the nature of_this concept '' ? 
`` it be a kind_of agreement in_which each party give something to the other '' , jack say . 
`` we regard it as fair only when each party feel that what he has receive be as valuable , or more valuable , than what he has give '' . 
his heart , he discover , was pound . 
`` for_instance , hesperus agree to help me find my property , and i agree to take him to earth . 
between individuals , this process is call bargaining . 
when it is do between races or nations , it is call make a treaty . 
and the major part of my mission to your nest be to make a treaty between your race and mine . 
recover the property be much less important '' . 
`` strange '' , gabriel say . 
`` and apparently impossible . 
though it might be that we would have much to give you , you have nothing to give us '' . 
`` hesperus and lucifer '' , jack say , `` show that we do '' . 
another pause ; but this one be not_nearly as long . 
`` then it be a matter of pleasure ; of curiosity ; of a more alive time . 
yes , those could be commodities under this concept . 
but you should understand , jack , that hesperus and lucifer be not_long out of the nursery . 
visit the earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who be older '' . 
this explain a great_deal . 
`` all the more reason , then '' , jack say , `` why we must have a treaty . 
we will gladly entertain your young and give them proper living_quarters , in_return for their help in run our fusion_reactors . 
but we must know if this be in_accordance_with your customs , and must have your agreement they will not misuse the power we put in their hands , to our hurt '' . 
`` but this simply require that they behave in_accordance_with the dictates of their own natures , and respect yours in_turn . 
to this we of_course agree '' . 
jack feel a wave of complete elation , but in a second it had vanish without a trace . 
what gabriel was ask be that mankind forego all its parochial moral judgments , and contract to let the angels serve on earth as_it_is in heaven regardless_of the applicable earth laws . 
the angels in_turn would exercise similar restraints in respect for the natural preferences and natures of the earthmen - but they have no faintest notion of man 's perverse habit of pass and enforce laws which be contrary to his own preferences and violations of his nature . 
the simple treaty principle that gabriel was ask him to ratify , in_short , be nothing less_than total trust . 
nothing less would serve . 
and it might be , consider the uncomfortable custom the angels have of think_of everything in_terms_of absolutes , that the proposal of anything less might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war . 
furthermore , even the highly trained law clerk who be a part of jack 's total make-up could not understand how the principle could ever be codify . 
almost the whole experience of mankind point toward suspicion , not trust , as the safest and sanest attitude toward all outsiders . 
yet there was some precedent for it . 
the history of disarmament agreements , for_instance , had be unreassuringly dismal ; but the united_states and the union_of_soviet_socialist_republics nevertheless did eventually agree on an atomic_bomb test ban , and a sort_of provisional acceptance of each other 's good intentions on this limited question . 
out of_that agreement , though not by any easy road , eventually emerge the present world hegemony of the united_nations ; suspicion between member states still exist , but it be of about the same low order of virulence as the twentieth-century rivalry between arizona and california over water_supplies . 
besides , agreements `` in_principle '' , with the petty details to be thrash_out later , be commonplace in diplomatic history . 
the trouble with them be that they almost never work , and in_fact an agreement `` in_principle '' historically turn_out to be a sure sign that neither party really want the quarrel settled . 
suppose that this one were to work ? 
there be no question in jack 's mind of the good faith on_one_side , at_least . 
if mankind could be convince of that . 
it was worth try . 
in_fact , it had_to be try . 
it would be at_once the_most tentative and most final treaty that earth had ever sign . 
secretary_hart had teach jack , at_least partially , to be content with small beginnings in_all diplomatic matters ; but there was no small way to handle this one . 
he turn_back to the screens , the crucial , conclusive phrase on his lips . 
but he be too late . 
he had lose his audience . 
for a moment he could make no sense at_all of_what he see . 
it seem to be only a riot of color , light and meaningless activity . 
gradually , he realize that the pentagon of angel elders had vanish , and that the ritual learning dance of the nursery had been break_up . 
the angels in the nursery were zigzag wildly in_all_directions , seemingly at_random . 
`` hesperus ! 
what 's go_on here ? 
what 's happen '' ? 
`` your brothers have been find . 
they be on their way here '' . 
`` where ? 
i do n't see them . 
the instruments do n't show them '' . 
`` you can n't see them yet , jack . 
they 'll be in range in_a_short_while '' . 
jack scan the skies , the boards , and the skies again . 
nothing . 
no - there be a tiny pip on the radar ; and it was get bigger rapidly . 
if that be the skiff , it was making unprecedented speed . 
then the skiff heave into sight , just a dot of light at_first against the roiling blackness and crimson streaks of the coal_sack . 
through the telescope , jack could see that both spacesuits be still attached to it . 
the sail be still unfurled , though there be a good many holes in it , as langer had predict would be the case by now . 
it be a startling , almost numenous sight ; but even more awesome be the fact that it was trail an enormous comet 's - tail of angels . 
the skiff was not head for the nursery , however . 
it seem unlikely that her crew , if either of them be alive , could even see the ariadne , for they were pass her at_a_distance of nearly a light-year . 
and there would be no chance of signal them - without the nernst generator jack could not send a call powerful enough to get_through all the static , and by the time he could rebuild his fusion power the skiff would be gone . 
fuming , helpless , he watch them pass him . 
the sail , ragged though it be , still have enough surface to catch some of the ocean of power being pour_out from the nursery stars . 
he would never have believe , without see it , that the bizarre little vessel could go so fast . 
but where was it go ? 
and why was it cause so_much agitation among the angels , and being follow by so many_of them ? 
there was only one possible answer , but jack 's horrified mind refuse to believe it until he had feed the radar plots of the skiff 's course into the computer . 
the curve on the card the computer spit back at him could n't be argue with , however . 
the skiff was head for the very center of the nebula - toward that place which , jack know now , could hold nothing less important than the very core of the angel 's life and religion . 
it be clear that langer had at_last find a way to attract the angel 's attention . 
it be equally clear that as of_this moment , the treaty be off . 
langer would have to be head_off , whether he know where he was go or not . 
almost surely he did ; after_all , he had have the same set of facts as jack had have to work from , and he be an almost frighteningly observant man . 
but not having talk to the angels , he had made a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along the line . 
had he decide , perhaps , that the center of the cloud be a center of government , instead of a center of life and faith `` ? 
but it did n't matter now whether he mean to invade the holy_of_holies , or was simply head in_that direction by_accident . 
if it be intentional , it be now also unnecessary ; and whether intentional or not , the outcome would be disastrous . 
jack crawl under the boards and restore the six feet of lead_line he had excise from the nernst generator switch . 
when he be back on his feet again and about to reinstall the fuses , however , he hesitate . 
he have to have fusion power to catch_up_with the skiff , and he have to have it fast . 
but fusion power in the coal_sack be what had trigger all the trouble in_the_first_place - and he already have an angel aboard . 
`` hesperus '' ? 
`` receive '' . 
`` i 'm going_to turn_on my generator back on , as i promise to do . 
but i can n't take you to earth yet . 
first i 've got_to intercept my brothers before they get any deeper into trouble . 
will you obstruct this , or will you help ? 
i know it be not part of the bargain , and your elders might not like it '' . 
`` nobody else can live in your hearth while i be in it '' , hesperus say promptly . 
`` as for my elders , they have already admit that they be wrong . 
if because of_this incident they become angry with earth , i will not be permit to go there at_all . 
therefore of_course i will help '' . 
with a short-lived sigh of relief , jack plug_in the fuses back in and throw the switch . 
without an instant 's transition , the green_light that mean full fusion power wink on the board . 
always before , it had take five minutes to - 
of_course . 
hesperus be in there . 
from here on out , the ariadne was going_to be hotter than any space cruiser man had ever dream of . 
but since he had fail to anticipate it , he lose the five minutes anyhow , in plot an intercept orbit . 
`` hesperus , do n't use this t-tau vector trick of yours , please . 
ryan heft his bulk up and support it on one elbow . 
he rub his eyes sleepily with one huge paw . 
`` ekstrohm , nogol , you guys okay '' ? 
`` nothing wrong with me that could n't be cure '' , nogol say . 
he did n't say what would cure him ; he had been explain all during the trip what he need to make him feel like himself . 
his small black_eyes dart inside the olive oval of his face . 
`` ekstrohm '' ? 
ryan insist . 
`` okay '' . 
`` well , let 's take_a_look a ground-level look at the country around here '' . 
the facsiport roll open on the landscape . 
a range of bluffs hug the horizon , the color of decaying moss . 
above them , the sky be the black of space , or the almost equal black of the winter sky above minneapolis , see against neon-lit snow . 
that cold , empty sky be full of fire and light . 
it seem almost a magnification of the galaxy itself , of the milky_way , blow_up by some master photographer . 
this fiery swath be actually only a belt of minor_planets , almost like the asteroid belt in the original solar_system . 
these planets be much bigger , nearly all capable_of hold an atmosphere . 
but to the infuriation of scientists , for no known reason not all_of them did . 
this would be the fifth mapping expedition to the planetoids of yancy-6 in three generations . 
they lie months away from the nearest earth star by jump drive , and no one know what they be good for , although it was feel that they would probably be good for something if it could only be discover - much like the continent of antarctica in ancient history . 
`` how can a planet with so many neighbors be so lonely '' ? 
ryan ask . 
he be the captain , so he could ask questions like that . 
`` some can be lonely in a crowd '' , nogol say elaborately . 
`` what will we need outside , ryan '' ? 
ekstrohm ask . 
`` no helmets '' , the captain answer . 
`` we can breathe out there , all_right . 
it just won n't be easy . 
this old world lose all_of its helium and trace gases long_ago . 
nitrogen and oxygen be about it '' . 
`` ryan , look over there '' , nogol say . 
`` animals . 
ring the ship . 
think they be intelligent , maybe hostile '' ? 
`` i think they be dead '' , ekstrohm interject quietly . 
`` i get no readings from them at_all . 
sonic , electronic , galvanic - all blank . 
according to these needles , they be stone dead '' . 
`` ekstrohm , you and i will have_a_look '' , ryan say . 
`` you hold_down_the_fort , nogol . 
take_it_easy '' . 
`` easy '' , nogol confirm . 
`` i hear a story once about a rookie who get excited when the captain step outside and he could n't get an encephalographic reading on him . 
me , i know the mind of an officer work in a strange and unfathomable manner '' . 
`` i be not worried about you misread the dials , nogol , just_about a lug like you read them at_all . 
remember , when the little_hand be straight up that 's negative . 
positive results start when it go towards the hand you use to make your mark '' . 
`` but i be ambidextrous '' . 
ryan tell him what he could do then . 
ekstrohm smile , and follow the captain through the airlock with only a glance at the lapel gauge on his coverall . 
the strong negative field his suit set_up would help to repel bacteria and insects . 
actually , the types of infection that could attack a warm-blooded mammal be not infinite , and over the course of the last few hundred years adequate defenses had been find for all basic categories . 
he be n't likely to come_down with hot chills and puzzling striped fever . 
they ignore the ladder down to the planet surface and , with only a glance at the seismological gauge to judge surface resistance , drop to the ground . 
it was day , but in the thin atmosphere contrasts be sharp between light and shadow . 
they walk from midnight to noon , noon to midnight , and come to the beast sprawled on its side . 
ekstrohm nudge it with a boot . 
`` hey , this be pretty close_to a wart-hog '' . 
`` uh-huh '' , ryan admit . 
`` one of the best matches i 've ever find . 
well , it has_to happen . 
statistical average and all . 
still , it sometimes give you a creepy feeling to find a rabbit or a snapping_turtle on some strange world . 
it make you wonder if this exploration business be n't all some big joke , and somebody has be everywhere before you even start '' . 
the surveyor look sidewise at the captain . 
the big man seldom gave_out with such thoughts . 
ekstrohm clear his throat . 
`` what shall we do with this one ? 
dissect it '' ? 
ryan nudge it with his toe , follow ekstrohm 's example . 
`` i do n't know , stormy . 
it sure as hell does n't look_like any dominant intelligent species to me . 
no hands , for_one_thing . 
of_course , that be not definite proof '' . 
`` no , it be n't '' , ekstrohm say . 
`` i think we 'd better let it lie until we get a clearer picture of the ecological setup around here . 
in_the_meantime , we might be think on the problem all these dead beasts represent . 
what kill them '' ? 
`` it look like we did , when we make blastdown '' . 
`` but what about our landing be lethal to the creatures '' ? 
`` radiation '' ? 
ekstrohm suggest . 
`` the planet be very low in radiation from mineral deposits , and the atmosphere seem to shield out most_of the solar output . 
any little dose of radiation might knock_off these critters '' . 
`` i do n't know about that . 
maybe it would work the other way . 
maybe because they have have virtually no radioactive exposure and do n't have any r 's stored up , they could take a_lot without harm '' . 
`` then maybe it be the shockwave we set_up . 
or maybe it be sheer xenophobia . 
they curl_up and die at the sight of something strange and alien - like a spaceship '' . 
`` maybe '' , the captain admit . 
`` at this stage of the game anything could be possible . 
but there 's one possibility i particularly do n't like '' . 
`` and that be '' ? 
`` suppose it be not us that kill these aliens . 
suppose it be something right_on the planet , native to_it . 
i just hope it does n't work on earthmen too . 
these critters go real sudden '' . 
ekstrohm lie in his bunk and think , the camp be quiet . 
the earthmen make camp outside the spaceship . 
there was no reason to leave the comfortable quarters inside the ship , except that , face with a possibility of sleep on solid_ground , they simply had_to get_out . 
the camp be a cluster of aluminum bubbles , ringed with a spy web to alert the earthmen to the approach of any being . 
each man have a bubble to himself , privacy after the long period of enforced intimacy on_board the ship . 
ekstrohm lie in his bunk and listen to the sounds of the night on yancey-6 138 . 
there was a keening of wind , and a cracking of the frozen ground . 
insects there be on the world , but they were freeze solid during the night , only to revive and thaw in the morning sun . 
the bunk he lie on be much more uncomfortable than the acceleration couches on_board . 
yet he know the others were sleep more soundly , now that they had renew their contact with the_matter that had birthe them to send them ride high vacuum . 
ekstrohm be not asleep . 
now there could be an end to pretend . 
he throw_off the light blanket and swing his feet off the bunk , to the floor . 
ekstrohm stand_up . 
there was no_longer any need to hide . 
but what was there to do ? 
what had change for him ? 
he no_longer had_to lie in his bunk all night , his eyes closed , pretend to sleep . 
in privacy he could walk_around , leave the light on , read . 
it be small comfort for insomnia . 
ekstrohm never sleep . 
some doctors had inform him he be mistaken about this . 
actually , they say , he did sleep , but so shortly and fitfully that he forget . 
others admit he be absolutely correct - he never sleep . 
his body_processes only slow_down enough for him to dispel fatigue poisons . 
occasionally he fall into a waking , gritty-eyed stupor ; but he never sleep . 
never at_all . 
naturally , he could n't let his shipmates know this . 
insomnia would ground him from the exploration_service , on physiological if_not psychological grounds . 
he had_to hide it . 
over the years , he had have buddies in space in whom he think he could confide . 
the buddies invariably take_advantage of him . 
since he could n't sleep anyway , he might as_well stand_watch their watches for them or write their reports . 
where the hell did he get_off threaten to report any laxness on their part to the captain ? 
a man with insomnia had_better avoid bad dreams of_that kind if he know what be good for him . 
ekstrohm had_to hide his secret . 
in a camp , instead of shipboard , hide the secret be easier . 
but the secret itself be just_as hard . 
ekstrohm pick_up a lightweight no-back from the ship 's library , a book by bloch , the famous twentieth century expert on sex . 
he scan a_few lines on the social repercussions of a celebrated nineteenth century sex murderer , but he could n't seem to concentrate on the weighty , pontifical , ponderous style . 
on impulse , he flip up the heat control on his coverall and slide back the hatch of the bubble . 
ekstrohm walk through the alien glass and look up at the unfamiliar constellations , smell the frozen sterility of the thin air . 
behind him , his mates stir without wake . 
ekstrohm was startle in the morning by a banging on the hatch of his bubble . 
it take him a_few seconds to put his thoughts in_order , and_then he get_up from the bunk where he had been rest , sleeplessly . 
the angry burnt-red face of ryan greet him . 
`` okay , stormy , this be n't the place for fun and games . 
what did you do with them '' ? 
`` do with what '' ? 
`` the dead beasties . 
all the dead_animals lie around the ship '' . 
`` what are you talk_about , ryan ? 
what do you think i did with them '' ? 
`` i do n't know . 
all i know be that they be gone '' . 
`` gone '' ? 
ekstrohm shoulder his way outside and scan the veldt . 
there was no ring of animal corpses . 
nothing . 
nothing but wispy grass whip in the keen breeze . 
`` i 'll be damned '' , ekstrohm say . 
`` you be right_now , buddy . 
expe does n't like anybody muck_up primary evidence '' . 
`` where do you get_off , ryan '' ? 
ekstrohm demand . 
`` why pick me for your patsy ? 
this has_got_to be some kind_of local phenomenon . 
why accuse a shipmate of be behind this '' ? 
`` listen , ekstrohm , i want to give you the benefit of every doubt . 
but you be n't exactly the model of a surveyor , you know . 
you 've been ride on a pink ticket for six years , you know that '' . 
`` no '' , ekstrohm say , `` no , i did n't know that '' . 
`` you 've been hide things from me and nogol every jump we 've make with you . 
now come this ! 
it fit the pattern of secrecy and stealth you 've been involve in '' . 
`` what could i do with your lousy dead_bodies ? 
what would i want with them '' ? 
`` all i know be that you be outside the bubbles last night , and you be the only sentient being who come_in or out of our alarm web . 
the tapes show that . 
now all the bodies be missing , like they get_up and walk away '' . 
it be not a new experience to ekstrohm . 
no . 
suspicion be n't new_to him at_all . 
`` ryan , there are other explanations for the disappearance of the bodies . 
look_for them , will you ? 
i give you my word i 'm not try to pull some stupid kind_of joke , or to deliberately foul_up the expedition . 
take my word , can n't you '' ? 
ryan shake his head . 
`` i do n't think i can . 
there 's still such a thing as mental_illness . 
you may_not be responsible '' . 
ekstrohm scowl . 
`` do n't try anything violent , stormy . 
i outweigh you fifty pounds and i be fast for a big man '' . 
`` i was n't plan on jump you . 
why do you have_to jump me the first time something go_wrong ? 
she live and was give a name . 
helva . 
for her first three vegetable months she wave her crabbed claws , kick weakly with her clubbed feet and enjoy the usual routine of the infant . 
she be not alone for there be three other such children in the big city 's special nursery . 
soon they all were remove to central_laboratory_school where their delicate transformation begin . 
one of the babies die in the initial transferral but of helva 's `` class '' , seventeen thrive in the metal shells . 
instead of kick feet , helva 's neural responses start her wheels ; instead of grab with hands , she manipulate mechanical extensions . 
as she mature , more_and_more neural synapses would be adjust to operate other mechanisms that go_into the maintenance and running of a space ship . 
for helva was destine to be the `` brain '' half of a scout ship , partner with a man or a woman , whichever she choose , as the mobile half . 
she would be among the elite of her kind . 
her initial intelligence_tests register above normal and her adaptation index be unusually high . 
as long as her development within her shell live_up_to expectations , and there be no side-effects from the pituitary tinkering , helva would live a rewarding , rich and unusual life , a far cry from what she would have face as an ordinary , `` normal '' being . 
however , no diagram of her brain patterns , no early i._q. tests record certain essential facts about helva that central must eventually learn . 
they would have to bide their official time and see , trust that the massive doses of shell-psychology would suffice her , too , as the necessary bulwark against her unusual confinement and the pressures of her profession . 
a ship run by a human brain could not run rogue or insane with the power and resources central have to build into their scout ships . 
brain ships be , of_course , long past the experimental stages . 
most babes survive the techniques of pituitary manipulation that keep their bodies small , eliminate the necessity of transfers from smaller to larger shells . 
and very , very_few were lose when the final connection was make to the control_panels of ship or industrial combine . 
shell people resemble mature dwarfs in size whatever their natal deformities be , but the well-oriented brain would not have change places with the_most perfect body in the universe . 
so , for happy years , helva scoot around in her shell with her classmates , play such games as stall , power-seek , study her lessons in trajectory , propulsion techniques , computation , logistics , mental_hygiene , basic alien psychology , philology , space history , law , traffic , codes : all the et ceteras that eventually become compounded into a reasoning , logical , informed citizen . 
not so obvious to her , but of more importance to her teachers , helva ingest the precepts of her conditioning as easily as she absorb her nutrient fluid . 
she would one_day be grateful to the patient drone of the sub-conscious-level instruction . 
helva 's civilization be not without busy , do-good associations , explore possible inhumanities to terrestrial as_well as extraterrestrial citizens . 
one such group get all incensed over shelled `` children '' when helva was just turn fourteen . 
when they were force to , central worlds shrug its shoulders , arrange a tour of the laboratory_schools and set_off the tour off to a big start by show the members case_histories , complete with photographs . 
very_few committees ever look past the first few photos . 
most_of their original objections about `` shells '' were override by the relief that these hideous ( to them ) bodies were mercifully conceal . 
helva 's class was do fine_arts , a selective subject in her crowded program . 
she had activate one of her microscopic tools which she would later use for minute repairs to various parts of her control_panel . 
her subject be large - a copy of the last_supper - and her canvas , small - the head of a tiny screw . 
she had tune her sight to the proper degree . 
as she work she absentmindedly croon , produce a curious sound . 
shell people use their own vocal_cords and diaphragms but sound issue through microphones rather_than mouths . 
helva 's hum then have a curious vibrancy , a warm , dulcet quality even in its aimless chromatic wanderings . 
`` why , what a lovely voice you have '' , say one of the female visitors . 
helva `` look '' up and catch a fascinating panorama of regular , dirty craters on a flaky pink surface . 
her hum become a gurgle of surprise . 
she instinctively regulate her `` sight '' until the skin lose its cratered look and the pores assume normal proportions . 
`` yes , we have quite_a_few years of voice training , madam '' , remark helva calmly . 
`` vocal peculiarities often become excessively irritating during prolonged intra-stellar distances and must be eliminate . 
i enjoy my lessons '' . 
although this be the first time that helva had see unshelled people , she take this experience calmly . 
any other reaction would have been report instantly . 
`` i mean that you have a nice singing_voice , dear '' , the lady amend . 
`` thank_you . 
would you like to see my work '' ? 
helva ask , politely . 
she instinctively sheer away from personal discussions but she file_away the comment away for further meditation . 
`` work '' ? ask the lady . 
`` i am currently reproduce the last_supper on the head of a screw '' . 
`` o , i say '' , the lady twittered . 
helva turn_back her vision back to magnification and survey her copy critically . 
`` of_course , some of my color values do not match the old_master 's and the perspective be faulty but i believe it to be a fair_copy '' . 
the lady 's eyes , unmagnified , bug_out . 
`` oh , i forget '' , and helva 's voice be really contrite . 
if she could have blush , she would have . 
`` you people do n't have adjustable vision '' . 
the monitor of_this discourse grin with_pride and amusement as helva 's tone indicate pity for the unfortunate . 
`` here , this will help '' , suggest helva , substitute a magnifying device in one extension and hold it over the picture . 
in a kind_of shock , the ladies and gentlemen of the committee bend to observe the incredibly copy and brilliantly execute last_supper on the head of a screw . 
`` well '' , remark one gentleman who had been force to accompany his wife , `` the good lord can eat where angels fear to tread '' . 
`` are you refer , sir '' , ask helva politely , `` to the dark_age discussions of the number of angels who could stand on the head of a pin '' ? 
`` i have_in_mind that in mind '' . 
`` if you substitute ' atom ' for ' angel ' , the problem be not insoluble , give the metallic content of the pin in_question '' . 
`` which you are program to compute '' ? 
`` of_course '' . 
`` did they remember to program a sense_of_humor , as_well , young_lady '' ? 
`` we are direct to develop a sense of proportion , sir , which contribute the same effect '' . 
the good man chortle appreciatively and decide the trip be worth his time . 
if the investigation committee spend months digest the thoughtful food serve them at the laboratory_school , they leave helva with a morsel as_well . 
`` singing '' as applicable to herself require research . 
she had , of_course , been expose to and enjoy a music appreciation course which had include the better known classical works such_as `` tristan und isolde '' , `` candide '' , `` oklahoma '' , `` nozze de figaro '' , the atomic age singers , eileen_farrell , elvis_presley and geraldine_todd , as_well as the curious rhythmic progressions of the venusians , capellan visual chromatics and the sonic concerti of the altairians . 
but `` singing '' for any shell person pose considerable technical difficulties to be overcome . 
shell people were school to examine every aspect of a problem or situation before make a prognosis . 
balance properly between optimism and practicality , the nondefeatist attitude of the shell people lead them to extricate themselves , their ships and personnel , from bizarre situations . 
therefore to helva , the problem that she could n't open her mouth to sing , among other restrictions , did not bother her . 
she would work_out a method , bypass her limitations , whereby she could sing . 
she approach the problem by investigate the methods of sound_reproduction through the centuries , human and instrumental . 
her own sound production equipment be essentially more instrumental than vocal . 
breath control and the proper enunciation of vowel_sounds within the oral_cavity appear to require the_most development and practice . 
shell people did not , strictly_speaking , breathe . 
for their purposes , oxygen and other gases were not draw from the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustain artificially by solution in their shells . 
after experimentation , helva discover that she could manipulate her diaphragmic unit to sustain tone . 
by relax the throat muscles and expand the oral_cavity well into the frontal_sinuses , she could direct the vowel_sounds into the_most felicitous position for proper reproduction through her throat microphone . 
she compare the results with tape_recordings of modern singers and be not unpleased although her own tapes have a peculiar quality about them , not_at_all unharmonious , merely unique . 
acquire a repertoire from the laboratory library be no problem to one train to perfect recall . 
she find herself able to sing any role and any song which strike her fancy . 
it would not have occur to her that it be curious for a female to sing bass , baritone , tenor , alto , mezzo , soprano and coloratura as she please . 
it be , to helva , only a matter of the correct reproduction and diaphragmic control require by the music attempt . 
if the authorities remark on her curious avocation , they did so among themselves . 
shell people were encourage to develop a hobby so_long as they maintain proficiency in their technical work . 
on the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her shell , helva was unconditionally graduate and install in her ship , the xh-834 . 
her permanent titanium shell was recess behind an even more indestructible barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship . 
the neural , audio , visual and sensory connections were make and seal . 
her extendibles were divert , connect or augment and the final , delicate-beyond-description brain taps were complete while helva remain anesthetically unaware_of the proceedings . 
when she awake , she be the ship . 
her brain and intelligence control every function from navigation to such loading as a scout ship of her class need . 
she could take_care of herself and her ambulatory half , in any situation already record in the annals of central worlds and any situation its most fertile minds could imagine . 
her first actual flight , for she and her kind had make mock flights on dummy panels since she be eight , show her complete mastery of the techniques of her profession . 
she be ready for her great adventures and the arrival of her mobile partner . 
there be nine qualified scouts sit around collect base pay the day helva was commission . 
there be several missions which demand instant attention but helva had be of interest to several department_heads in central for_some_time and each man be determined to have her assign to his section . 
consequently no one had remember to introduce helva to the prospective partners . 
the ship always choose its own partner . 
had there be another `` brain '' ship at the base at the moment , helva would have been guide to make the first move . 
as it be , while central wrangle among itself , robert_tanner sneak_out of the pilots ' barracks , out to the field and over to helva 's slim metal hull . 
`` hello , anyone at_home '' ? 
tanner wisecrack . 
`` of_course '' , reply helva logically , activate her outside scanners . 
`` be you my partner '' ? she ask hopefully , as she recognize the scout_service uniform . 
`` all you have to do be ask '' , he retort hopefully . 
`` no one has come . 
i think perhaps there be no partners available and i 've have no directives from central '' . 
even to herself helva sound a_little self-pitying but the truth be she be lonely , sit on the darkened field . 
always she had have the company of other shells and more recently , technicians by the score . 
the sudden solitude had lose its momentary charm and become oppressive . 
`` no directives from central be scarcely a cause for regret , but there happen to be eight other guys bite their fingernails to the quick just wait for an invitation to board you , you beautiful thing '' . 
it would have kill you in the cabin . 
do you have anything for me `` ? 
mercer stammer , not know what b ' dikkat mean , and the two-nosed man answer for him , `` i think he have a nice baby head , but it be n't big enough for you to take yet '' . 
mercer never notice the needle touch his arm . 
b ' dikkat had turn_to the next knot of people when the super-condamine hit mercer . 
he try to run after b ' dikkat , to hug the lead spacesuit , to tell b ' dikkat that he love him . 
he stumble and fall , but it did not hurt . 
the many-bodied girl lie near him . 
mercer speak_to her . 
`` is n't it wonderful ? 
you be beautiful , beautiful , beautiful . 
i be so happy to be here '' . 
the woman covered with growing hands come and sit beside them . 
she radiate warmth and good_fellowship . 
mercer think that she look very distinguished and charming . 
he struggle out of his clothes . 
it be foolish and snobbish to wear clothing when none of these nice people did . 
the two women babble and croon at him . 
with one corner of his mind he know that they were say nothing , just express the euphoria of a drug so powerful that the known universe had forbid it . 
with most_of his mind he be happy . 
he wonder how anyone could have the good_luck to visit a planet as nice as this . 
he try to tell the lady_da , but the words be n't quite straight . 
a painful stab hit him in the abdomen . 
the drug go_after the pain and swallow it . 
it be like the cap in the hospital , only a_thousand_times better . 
the pain be gone , though it had be crippling the first time . 
he force himself to be deliberate . 
he ram his mind into focus and say to the two ladies who lie pinkly nude beside him in the desert , `` that be a good bite . 
maybe i will grow another head . 
that would make b ' dikkat happy '' ! 
the lady_da force the foremost of her bodies in an upright position . 
say she , `` i be strong , too . 
i can talk . 
remember , man , remember . 
people never live forever . 
we can die , too , we can die like real people . 
i do so believe_in death '' ! 
mercer smile at her through his happiness . 
`` of_course you can . 
but be n't this nice '' . 
with this he feel his lips thicken and his mind go slack . 
he be wide awake , but he did not feel_like do anything . 
in_that beautiful place , among all those companionable and attractive people , he sit and smile . 
b ' dikkat was sterilize his knives . 
mercer wonder how long the super-condamine had last him . 
he endure the ministrations of the dromozoa without screams or movement . 
the agonies of nerves and itching of skin be phenomena which happen somewhere near him , but mean nothing . 
he watch his own body with remote , casual interest . 
the lady_da and the hand-covered woman stay near him . 
after a long_time the half-man drag himself over to the group with his powerful arms . 
having arrive he blink sleepily and friendlily at them , and lapse back into the restful stupor from which he had emerge . 
mercer see the sun rise on_occasion , close his eyes briefly , and open them to see stars shine . 
time have no meaning . 
the dromozoa feed him in their mysterious way ; the drug cancel_out his needs for cycles of the body . 
at_last he notice a return of the inwardness of pain . 
the pains themselves had not change ; he had . 
he know all the events which could take_place on shayol . 
he remember them well from his happy period . 
formerly he had notice them - now he feel them . 
he try to ask the lady_da how long they had have the drug , and_how much longer they would have to wait before they have it again . 
she smile at him with benign , remote happiness ; apparently her many torsos , stretch_out along the ground , have a greater capacity for retain the drug than did his body . 
she mean him well , but be in no condition for articulate speech . 
the half-man lie on the ground , arteries pulsate prettily behind the half-transparent film which protect his abdominal_cavity . 
mercer squeeze the man 's shoulder . 
the half-man wake , recognize mercer and give him a healthily sleepy grin . 
`` ' a good morrow to you , my boy ' . 
that be out of a play . 
did you ever see a play '' ? 
`` you mean a game with cards '' ? 
`` no '' , say the half-man , `` a sort_of eye-machine with real people do the figures '' . 
`` i never see that '' , say mercer , `` but i '' - 
`` but you want to ask me when b ' dikkat is going_to come_back with the needle '' . 
`` yes '' , say mercer , a_little ashamed of his obviousness . 
`` soon '' , say the half-man . 
that be why i think_of plays . 
we all know what is going_to happen . 
we all know when it is going_to happen . 
we all know what the dummies will do `` - he gesture at the hummocks in_which the decorticated men were cradle - '' and we all know what the new people will ask . 
but we never know how long a scene is going_to take `` . 
`` what be a ' scene '' ' ? ask mercer . 
`` be that the name for the needle '' ? 
the half-man laugh with something close_to real humor . 
`` no , no , no . 
you 've get the lovelies on the brain . 
a scene be just a part of a play . 
i mean we know the order in_which things happen , but we have no clocks and nobody care enough to count days or to make calendars and there 's not_much climate here , so none of us know how long anything take . 
the pain seem short and the pleasure seem long . 
i 'm inclined to think that they be about two earth-weeks each '' . 
mercer did not know what an `` earth-week '' be , since he had not be a well-read man before his conviction , but he get nothing more from the half-man at_that_time . 
the half-man receive a dromozootic implant , turn red in the face , shout senselessly at mercer , `` take_out it out , you fool ! 
take_out it out of me '' ! 
when mercer look_on helplessly , the half-man twist over on his side , his pink dusty back turn to mercer , and weep hoarsely and quietly to himself . 
mercer himself could not tell how long it was before b ' dikkat come_back . 
it might have be several days . 
it might have be several months . 
once_again b ' dikkat move among them like a father ; once_again they cluster like children . 
this time b ' dikkat smile pleasantly at the little head which had grow out of mercer 's thigh - a sleeping child 's head , covered with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes . 
mercer get the blissful needle . 
when b ' dikkat cut the head from mercer 's thigh , he feel the knife grind against the cartilage which hold the head to his own body . 
he see the child-face grimace as the head was cut ; he feel the far , cool flash of unimportant pain , as b ' dikkat dab the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which stop all bleeding immediately . 
the next time it be two legs grow from his chest . 
then there had be another head beside his own . 
or be that after the torso and legs , waist to toe-tips , of the little girl which had grow from his side ? 
he forget the order . 
he did not count time . 
lady_da smile at him often , but there be no love in_this_place . 
she had lose the extra torsos . 
in_between teratologies , she be a pretty and shapely woman ; but the nicest thing about their relationship be her whisper to him , repeat some thousands of time , repeat with smiles and hope , `` people never live forever '' . 
she find this immensely comforting , even_though mercer did not make_sense much sense out of_it . 
thus events occur , and victims change in appearance , and new ones arrive . 
sometimes b ' dikkat take the new ones , rest in the everlasting sleep of their burned-out brains , in a ground-truck to be add to other herds . 
the bodies in the truck thresh and bawl without human speech when the dromozoa strike them . 
finally , mercer did manage to follow b ' dikkat to the door of the cabin . 
he have to fight the bliss of super-condamine to do_it . 
only the memory of previous hurt , bewilderment and perplexity make him sure that if he did not ask b ' dikkat when he , mercer , be happy , the answer would no_longer be available when he need it . 
fight pleasure itself , he beg b ' dikkat to check the records and to tell him how long he had be there . 
b ' dikkat grudgingly agree , but he did not come_out of the doorway . 
he speak through the public address box build into the cabin , and his gigantic voice roar out over the empty plain , so_that the pink herd of talking people stir gently in their happiness and wonder what their friend b ' dikkat might be want to tell them . 
when he say it , they think it exceedingly profound , though none of them understand it , since it be simply the amount_of_time that mercer had be on shayol : 
`` standard years - eighty-four years , seven months , three days , two hours , eleven and one half minutes . 
good_luck , fellow '' . 
mercer turn_away . 
the secret little corner of his mind , which stay sane through happiness and pain , make him wonder about b ' dikkat . 
what persuade the cow-man to remain on shayol ? 
what keep him happy without super-condamine ? 
be b ' dikkat a crazy slave to his own duty or be he a man who have hopes of go_back to his own planet some_day , surround by a family of little cow-people resemble himself ? 
mercer , despite his happiness , weep a_little at the strange fate of b ' dikkat . 
his own fate he accept . 
he remember the last time he had eat - actual eggs from an actual pan . 
the dromozoa keep him alive , but he did not know how they did it . 
he stagger back to the group . 
the lady_da , naked in the dusty plain , wave a hospitable hand and show that there was a place for him to sit beside her . 
there be unclaimed square_miles of seating space around them , but he appreciate the kindliness of her gesture none the less . 
the years , if they be years , go_by . 
the land of shayol did not change . 
sometimes the bubbling sound of geysers come faintly across the plain to the herd of men ; those who could talk declare it to be the breathing of captain_alvarez . 
there was night and day , but no setting of crops , no change of season , no generations of men . 
time stand_still for these people , and their load of pleasure be so commingled with the shocks and pains of the dromozoa that the words of the lady_da take_on very remote meaning . 
`` people never live forever '' . 
her statement be a hope , not a truth in_which they could believe . 
they did not have the wit to follow the stars in their courses , to exchange names with each other , to harvest the experience of each for the wisdom of all . 
there was no dream of escape for these people . 
though they see the old-style chemical rockets lift_up from the field beyond b ' dikkat 's cabin , they did not make plans to hide among the frozen crop of transmuted flesh . 
far long_ago , some other prisoner than one of these had try to write a letter . 
his handwriting be on a rock . 
mercer read it , and so had a_few of the others , but they could not tell which man had done it . 
nor did they care . 
the letter , scrape on stone , had be a message home . 
they could still read the opening : `` once , i be like you , step_out of my window at the end of day , and let the winds blow me gently toward the place i live in . 
once , like you , i have one head , two hands , ten fingers on my hands . 
the front part of my head was call a face , and i could talk with_it . 
now i can only write , and that only when i get out of pain . 
dan_morgan tell himself he would forget ann_turner . 
he be well rid of her . 
he certainly did n't want a wife who be fickle as ann . 
if he had marry her , he 'd have been ask_for trouble . 
but all_of this be rationalization . 
sometimes he wake_up in_the_middle of the night think_of ann , and_then could not get_back to sleep . 
his plans and dreams had revolve_around her so_much and for so_long that now he feel as if he have nothing . 
the easiest thing would be to sell_out to al_budd and leave the country , but there was a stubborn streak in him that would n't allow it . 
the best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poison him be hard_work . 
he find that if he be tired enough at night , he go_to_sleep simply because he be too exhausted to stay awake . 
each_day he find himself think_of less often of ann ; each_day the hurt be a_little duller , a_little less poignant . 
he have plenty of work to do . 
because the summer be unusually dry and hot , the spring produce a smaller stream than in ordinary years . 
the grass in the meadows come fast , now that the warm weather be here . 
he could not afford to lose a drop of the precious water , so he spend most_of his waking hours along the ditches in his meadows . 
he have no idea how much time budd would give him . 
in_any_case , he have no intention of being catch asleep , so he carry his revolver in its holster on his hip and he take his winchester with him and lean it against the fence . 
he stop every few minutes and lean_on his shovel as he study the horizon , but nothing happen , each_day drag_out with monotonous calm . 
when , in late afternoon on the last_day in june , he see two people top the ridge to_the_south and walk toward the house , he quit work immediately and stride to his rifle . 
it could be some kind_of trick budd had think_up . 
no one walk in_this country , least_of_all ed_dow or dutch renfro or any of the rest of the bar_b crew . 
morgan watch the two figures for a time , puzzled . 
when they be closer and he see that one be a woman , he be more puzzled than ever . 
he clean his shovel , leave it against the fence , pick_up his winchester , and start downstream . 
his visitors had crawl through the south fence and were cross the meadow , angle toward the house . 
now he see that both the man and woman were move slowly and irregularly , stagger , as if they find it a struggle to remain on their feet . 
reach the house ahead of them , he wait with his winchester in his hands . 
they crawl through the north fence and come_on toward him , and now he see that both be young , not more_than nineteen or twenty . 
they be dirty , their clothes be torn , and the girl be so exhausted that she fall when she be still twenty feet from the front_door . 
she lie there , make no effort to get_back on her feet . 
the boy come on to the porch and sit_down , his gaze on morgan as if half expect him to shoot and not really care . 
morgan hesitate , think that if this be a trick , it be a good one . 
he did n't think it be possible for this couple to be pretend . 
the boy lick his dry lips . 
he ask , `` could we have a drink '' ? 
morgan jerk his head toward_the_front door . 
`` in the kitchen '' , he say . 
lean his winchester against the front of the house , he walk to the girl . 
`` get_up . 
there 's water in the house '' . 
she did n't move or say anything . 
her eyes be glazed as if she did n't hear or even see him . 
she had reach a point at which she did n't even care how she look . 
her face be very thin , and burn by the sun until much of the skin be dead and peeling , the new skin under_it red and angry . 
her blond hair be frowzy , her dress torn in_several_places , and her shoes be so completely worn_out that they be practically no protection . 
it must have hurt her even to walk , for the sole be completely off her left foot and morgan see that it be bruised and bleeding . 
he pick_up her up , slide one hand under her shoulders , the other under her knees , and carry her into the house . 
she be amazingly light , and so relaxed in his arms that he be n't even sure she be conscious . 
any lingering suspicion that this be a trick al_budd had think_up was dispel . 
no girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him . 
besides , she have a sweet face that attract him . 
he put_down her down on the couch , and go_into the kitchen , see that the boy had drop into a chair beside the table . 
they look a good_deal alike , morgan think . 
both have blonde hair and blue eyes , and there was even a faint similarity of features . 
morgan fill the dipper from the water bucket on the shelf , go_back into the front_room , lift the girl 's head , and hold the edge of the dipper to her mouth . 
she drink greedily , and murmur , `` thank_you '' , as he lower her head . 
he stand look down at her for a moment , wonder what could have reduce her to this condition . 
he had see a_few nester wagons go through the country , the families almost starve to death , but he had never see any of them on_foot and as bad off as these two . 
the girl drop_off to sleep . 
morgan return to the kitchen , build a fire , and carry in several buckets of water from the spring which he pour into the copper boiler that he had place on the stove . 
he bring his winchester in from the front of the house , then face the boy . 
`` who be you and what happen to you '' ? he ask . 
`` i be billy_jones '' , the boy answer . 
`` that be my wife sharon . 
we run_out of money and we have n't eat for two days '' . 
`` what are you do here '' ? 
`` be we in wyoming '' ? 
morgan nod . 
`` about five miles north of the line '' . 
jones sigh as if relieved . 
`` we 've been look_for work , but all the ranchers have turn_down us down '' . 
`` you mean you drag your wife all_over hell 's half-acre look_for work '' ? 
morgan demand . 
`` the town of buckhorn be only about six miles from here . 
why did n't you go there '' ? 
`` we did n't want town work '' , jones say . 
`` this be a mighty empty country '' , morgan say . 
`` there 's only one more ranch three miles north of here . 
you 'd have starve to death if you 'd miss both places '' . 
`` then we be lucky we get here . 
could you give us a job , mr. - - '' . 
`` morgan . 
dan_morgan '' . 
he be silent a moment , think he could use a man this time_of_year , and if the girl could cook , it would give him more time in the meadows , but he know nothing about the couple . 
they might kill him in his sleep , think there be money in the house . 
he dismiss the possibility at_once . 
the girl 's thin face haunt him . 
it be n't the face of a killer . 
he be n't so sure about the boy . 
he had n't shave for several weeks , his sparse beard give his face a pathetic , woebegone expression . 
there was more to this than jones had tell him . 
they were run from something . 
he 'd be an idiot to let them stay he think , but he could n't send them on , either . 
`` i could use some help '' , morgan say finally , `` but i can n't afford to pay you anything . 
i guess you 'd better go_on in the morning '' . 
`` we 'll work for our keep '' , the boy say eagerly . 
`` i 've been muck in a mine in the san_juan , but i used_to work on a ranch . 
sharon , she 's cook in a restaurant . 
we 'll work hard , mr._morgan '' . 
`` i 'll see '' , morgan say . 
`` right_now you need a meal and a bath . 
your wife be in terrible shape '' . 
`` i know '' , jones say dejectedly . 
morgan fill the fire box with wood again , then start supper and set the table . 
when the meal be ready , he tell jones to wash_up , and go_into the front_room , wake the girl . 
he say , `` i 've get some supper ready '' . 
she rub her eyes and stretch , then sit_up , her hands go_to her hair . 
`` i be a mess '' , she say , and suddenly she be alarmed . 
`` who be you ? 
how did we get here '' ? 
`` i be dan_morgan . 
this be the rafter_m . 
you fall_down in_front of the house , and i carry you in . 
i give you a drink and_then you go_to_sleep '' . 
`` oh '' . 
she stare at him , her eyes wide as she think_about what he had say ; then she murmur : `` you be very kind , mr._morgan . 
do you take_in all the strays who come_by '' ? 
`` i do n't have many strays come to my front_door '' , he say . 
`` think you can walk to the table '' ? 
`` of_course '' . 
she get to her feet , stagger , and almost fall . 
he catch her by an arm and help her into the kitchen . 
she sit_down at the table , shake her head . 
`` i be sorry , mr._morgan . 
i be usually a very strong woman , but i be awfully tired '' . 
`` and hungry '' , he say . 
`` start in . 
it be not_much of a meal , but it be what i eat '' . 
`` not_much of a meal '' ? the girl cry . 
`` mr. morgan , it be the best-looking food i ever see '' . 
he tell himself he had never see two people eat so_much . 
when they be finally satisfied , jones say , `` i think he 's going_to give us work '' . 
the grateful way she look at morgan make him ashamed of himself . 
when he see the expression in her eyes , he know he could n't send them on . 
she say , `` i guess the lord look_out for fools , drunkards , and innocents '' . 
morgan laugh . 
`` which be you '' ? 
`` we be not drunkards '' , she say . 
`` that be all i be sure of '' . 
she help him with the dishes , then he bring more water in from the spring before it get dark . 
he carry the tub from the back of the house where it hang from a nail in the wall . 
he say : `` you 'll feel a_lot better after you have a bath . 
your feet be in bad shape , mrs._jones . 
you 'll have to go_to town to see the doc '' . 
`` no , she 'll be all_right '' , jones say quickly . 
`` i mean , we do n't have any way to get there and we can n't expect you to quit work just to take us to town '' . 
`` we 'll see '' , morgan say . 
`` could you find me a needle and thread '' ? the girl ask . 
`` my dress need some work on it '' . 
he nod and , go_into the bedroom , bring a needle , thread , and scissors . 
he say : `` i 'm go_to_bed '' . 
he nod at the door in_front of him . 
`` that be my spare bedroom . 
the bed be n't made , but you 'll find plenty of blankets there '' . 
`` you be awfully kind '' , the girl say . 
`` we 'll pay you back if you 'll let us . 
some way '' . 
`` it 's all_right '' , he say . 
`` i get_up early . 
you 'd better sleep '' . 
jones follow him into the front_room , close the door behind him . 
he say : `` if it 's all_right with you , mr._morgan , i 'll sleep out here on the couch . 
we have n't sleep together since we start . 
i just can n't take_a_chance any chances on get her pregnant , and if we were sleep together & & & '' . 
he stop , embarrassed , and morgan say , `` i understand that , but i do n't savvy why you 'd go_off and leave your jobs in_the_first_place '' . 
`` we got fire '' , jones say . 
`` we have to do something '' . 
they be a pair of lost , whipped kids , morgan think as he go_to_bed . 
gavin pause wearily . 
`` you can n't stay here with me . 
it 's late and you say they 'd be here by dawn '' . 
`` you can n't make me go '' . 
gavin sink down again into his chair and begin to rock . 
he was think_of rittenhouse and_how he had leave him there , to rock to death on the porch of the splendide . 
it be the only thing in his life for which he feel guilt . 
beneath his black shirt his frail shoulders shake and croaks of pain break from his throat , the stored pain shatter free in slow gasps , terrible to see . 
clayton try to call_back the face of the man he had know . 
against that other man he could rally his anger ; against this bent man in the chair he be powerless . 
gavin 's lips move so_that clayton have to stoop to catch the words . 
`` do you remember big_charlie '' ? 
he whisper . 
`` he stick_with me all these years . 
just a half-breed ' pache , never say much , never mean anythin to me , but he stick_with me . 
he get_into a fight with tom_english , your brother 's son . 
it be a fair fight , the boy provoke it - big_charlie tell me so . 
i believe him . 
they kill big_charlie , dump his body in my rose_garden two nights ago . 
my men , they all leave me . 
just clear_out . 
i did n't understand why , clay . 
they just all clear_out . 
i treat them fair '' . 
he wipe his lips with a sleeve , then stare at clayton in a childish kind_of wonder . 
`` do you mean '' - he ask almost shyly - `` you want me to go_with you , wherever you 're go '' ? 
`` yes '' . 
`` you do n't hate me any_more '' ? 
clayton choke , shake his head , murmur , `` no '' . 
`` come here '' . 
the old_man beckon with one finger and clayton go_forward to him . 
gavin slip his arms around his chest and hug him fiercely . 
`` all my life '' , he say , `` i try . 
i try . 
i see you drift away - but i try . 
and you want no part of me when i have so_much to give . 
now there 's nothin left of me . 
laurel be gone , my men be gone , ed be dead - and you come to me , to help me . 
oh ! 
god in heaven , i can n't refuse you now . 
that would mock me too_much ! 
ca n't let you go way from me again '' . 
he close his eyes , ashamed of his tears . 
`` i 'll go , clay '' . 
clayton free himself from the embrace and step back . 
the eyes follow him fearfully . 
`` the horses . 
there is n't much time . 
i 'll saddle the horses and bring them round . 
you get ready '' . 
he burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold night air . 
gavin 's stallion be in the barn and he tighten the cinches over the saddle_blanket , work by_touch in the darkness , comfort the animal with easy words . 
when he had finish he lead him and the mare to the porch . 
the stallion had smell the mare come into heat and begin to paw the turf , shake his head . 
clayton loop the reins in a knot over the veranda post and pat the warm flesh of his neck . 
the mare had back_away . 
`` you take_it_easy , boy '' , clayton whisper . 
`` she does n't want you now . 
you take_it_easy , your time will come '' . 
gavin stand on the porch , a thin figure . 
he had take_down a carbine down from the wall and it trail from his hand , the stock bump on the wood floor . 
clayton call to him and he come slowly down the steps . 
`` clay '' , he say , `` where are we go '' ? 
`` to a ranch in the valley . 
there 's someone there i have_to see . 
we may take her with us - to california . 
i do n't know yet , it be crazy ; i have_to think_about it . 
but california be where we 're go '' . 
`` california '' . 
gavin begin to nod . 
`` that be a new land . 
a man could make a mark there . 
two men , together like us , we could do somethin fine out there , maybe find a place where no one 's ever be . 
start_out fresh , the two of us , like nothin had ever happen '' . 
`` yes , like a father and son '' . 
`` i make you what you be '' , gavin whisper . 
`` i make you so you could stand_up . 
i make you a man '' . 
`` yes , gavin , you did '' . 
he approach the horse and lay a hand on the stallion 's quivering neck . 
`` help me up , clay . 
help me up , i feel kind_of stiff '' . 
clayton lift him gently into the saddle , like a child . 
`` i hate to leave my garden '' , gavin say . 
`` they 'll trample it down . 
i love my garden '' . 
`` it will grow again - in california '' . 
`` i love this valley '' , he whisper huskily . 
`` live alone here for three years , before any man come . 
live alone by the river . 
it be nice then , so peaceful and quiet . 
there was no one but me . 
i do n't want to leave it '' . 
clayton swing into the saddle and whack the stallion 's rump . 
the two horses break from the yard , from the circle of light cast by the lamp still burn in the house , into the darkness . 
they ride at a measured pace through the valley . 
dawn would come soon and the night be at its coldest . 
the moon had sink below the black crest of the mountains and the land , see through eyes that had grow accustomed_to the absence of light , look primeval , as if no man had ever trespass before . 
it look as gavin had first see it years ago , on those nights when he sleep alone by his campfire and wake suddenly to the hoot of an owl or the rustle of a blade of grass in the moon 's wind - a savage land , untenanted and brooding , too strong to be break by the will of men . 
gavin sigh bitterly . 
in_that inert landscape the caravan of his desires pass before his mind . 
he see them ambush , strew in the postures of the broken and the dying . 
in_vain his mind grope to reassemble the bones of the relationships he had seek so desperately , but they would not come_to_life . 
the silence oppress him , make him bend low over the horse 's neck as if to hide from a wind that had begin to blow far away and was twist slowly through the darkness in its slow search . 
they pass ranches that were frame dark gray against the black hills . 
then at_last the darkness begin to dissolve . 
a bold line of violet break_loose from the high ridge of the mountains , follow by feathers of red that sweep the last stars from the sky . 
the wan light spread_over the ground and the valley reveal in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences and palely shadowed gullies . 
they had been see as soon as they leave the ranch , pick_out of the darkness by the weary though watchful eyes of two men post a_few hundred yards away in the windless shelter of the trees . 
the two men whip their horses into town and fling themselves up the steps of the saloon , cry their intelligence . 
the men in pettigrew 's be tired from a night 's drinking , their faces red and baggy . 
but the liquor had flushed their courage . 
they greet the news angrily , as though they had been cheat of purpose . 
lester hear their muttering , see their eyes reveal their desire . 
he work his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice come_out of his throat , dry and cracked . 
`` he 's leave . 
that be what you want , is n't it ? 
clayton be with him , take him out of the valley . 
you can n't '' - 
`` keep_out of_this '' , purvis snarl . 
`` he be not your brother , he be gavin 's son . 
you see , he lie to us when he say he was leave alone '' . 
joe_purvis was think_back many years . 
first he think_of the time he had ride to gavin and tell him how his cattle were being rustle at the far end of the valley . 
he remember gavin 's smirk , his own cringing feeling , his impotence . 
then he think_of a time when clayton 's horse had fall lame in the gap . 
his wife had say to him : `` nellie be in_love with clayton_roy . 
he would n't even dance with her at gavin 's party . 
he treat her like she be dirt . 
and you stand_by like a fool and let him do it '' . 
he remember clayton 's mocking smile in the saloon when he had ask him what he would do if they bring their cattle to water . 
it be the night clayton had trick them in the poker_game . 
`` you be gavin 's son '' , joe_purvis had say . 
he turn_to lester . 
`` you bring_back him back to this valley think he would help you find your boy . 
he mean to help gavin all_the_time . 
he make a fool of you , lester '' . 
he swing round to the other men - `` we can catch him easy ! 
there be plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place . 
if we let them go , they won n't stay away , they 'll find men to ride with them and they 'll be back . 
there 's only one way they can get_out now and that be through the gap - if we ride hard we can overtake them '' . 
lester 's hand flutter to cabot 's shoulder . 
the boy jerk away . 
`` he kill tom - do you understand that '' ? 
cabot turn back to the men and he be drunk with the thing they would do , wild to break from the cloying warmth of the saloon into the cold of the ebbing night . 
he flee through the door and down the steps , run , and the men grunt and follow , push lester to one side where he back against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raise before his eyes to shut_out the light . 
purvis and silas_pettigrew be the last to leave . 
they mount_up and ride slowly behind the others at a safe distance . 
in the cold dawn the mist swirl low to the ground , then rise with a gust of sudden wind to leave the valley clear . 
the clouds part and hard gashes of sunlight swoop down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold light so_that the shadows of the running horses flow like dark streams over the dazzling snow . 
when they turn in the saddle they could see the men behind them , string_out on the prairie in a flat black line . 
the wind of their running be cold and wild , the horses be lathered and their manes stream like stiff black pennants in the wind . 
the mare begin to tire and clayton feel the spray of snow from the hoofs of gavin 's stallion . 
he look over his shoulder at the thin dotting of pursuers . 
they neither gain nor fall_back . 
he ride low on the mare 's neck . 
ahead of him gavin turn slightly off the trail and point for the gap , no_more_than a mile away . 
gavin 's face be bloodless with_excitement . 
he did not look_back ; he could feel more_than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fan_out across the prairie to_the_north . 
he know who was ride after him - the men he had know all his life , the men who had work for him , swear their loyalty to him . 
now they were ride to kill him . 
and he was flee , run - flee his death and his life at_the_same_time . 
the land over which he speed be the land he had create and live in : his valley . 
with every leaping stride of the horse beneath him he cross one more patch of earth that had be his , that he would never see again . 
the gap loom before him - the place where had confront jack_english on_that day so many years ago - be his exit from all that have meaning to him . 
california be too far , he think . 
he would never reach california . 
he be too old - when he pass up and through the corridor of pines that line the trail he could see ahead , he was pass from life . 
the sentry be not dead . 
he was , in_fact , show signs of revive . 
he had been carry an enfield rifle and a holstered navy cap-and-ball pistol . 
a bayonet hang in a belt scabbard . 
he be partially uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat . 
mike strip these from him and don them . 
he and dean tie and gag the man , use his belt and shirt for the purpose . 
they drag him inside the building . 
fiske join them , unsteady on his feet . 
julia , see the bandage , rush to him . 
`` you be hurt '' ! 
she breathe . 
`` i never feel better in my life '' , fiske bluster . 
he turn to susan and kiss her on the cheek . 
`` thank_you , my dear '' , he say . 
`` you be very brave '' . 
mike silence them . 
`` we 'll talk later . 
first , we 've got_to get_out of here '' . 
`` we 'll grab horses '' , dean say . 
`` the main bunch be outside , but there be some over there inside the wall '' . 
mike debate it , try to decide whether fiske be strong enough to ride . 
but it at_least offer him a chance for living . 
he have none here . 
and , for the sake of julia and susan , it have to be try . 
the guerrilla bivouac remain silent . 
light show in the orderly room across the parade_ground . 
someone evidently be on_duty there . 
no_doubt there would be men guard the horses . 
about a dozen animals were hold inside the stockade , as best mike could make_out in the moonlight . 
evidently this be a precaution so_that mounts would be available in an emergency . 
he hand the guard 's rifle to fiske . 
`` dean and myself will try to cut out horses to ride '' , he say . 
`` we 'll stampede the rest . 
you stay with the ladies . 
all_of you be ready to ride hell for leather '' . 
he add , `` if this does n't work_out , the three of you barricade yourself in the house and talk_terms with them '' . 
he hand the bayonet to dean and keep the pistol . 
susan halt dean and kiss him . 
she cling_to him , talk to him , and dab at her eyes . 
mike turn_away . 
he was think that the way she had respond to his own kiss had n't mean what he had believe it had . 
he feel unutterably weary . 
dean turn from susan and take julia_fortune in his arms . 
he kiss her also , and with deep tenderness . 
she too begin to weep . 
he release her and join mike . 
`` all_right '' , he say . 
mike only say , `` later '' . 
`` be careful , mclish '' ! 
susan say fiercely . 
`` the way you be careful '' ? he snort . 
`` run_around in the moonlight almost naked and slug a man with a rock '' ? 
he keep go . 
he want no_more sentimental scenes with her . 
he might say or do something foolish . 
something all_of them would regret . 
he might tell her how sorry a spectacle she was make of herself , pretend to be blind_to the way julia_fortune had take dean 's affections from her . 
and use him , mike_mclish , as a sop to her pride . 
he hand the bayonet to dean and keep the pistol . 
`` stay well back of me '' , he say . 
`` i 'm going_to walk up to the horses , bold as brass , pretend i be one of the guerrillas . 
there be bound_to be someone on_guard , but the hat might fool them long enough for me to get close '' . 
hold the pistol concealed , he walk to_the_rear wall of the stockade . 
it was pierce by a wagon gate built of two wings . 
one wing stand open . 
mike pass_through it and move toward the dark mass of horses . 
they were tether , army style , on stable lines . 
a voice speak near-at-hand . 
`` who 's thet '' ? 
just me `` , mike say . 
'' is that you , bill `` ? 
he locate his man . 
the guard stand in the shadow of the stockade wall just out_of_reach of the moonlight . 
mike keep walk and get within arm 's reach before the man become suspicious and straighten from his lax slouch . 
mike strike with the muzzle of the pistol . 
but the luck that had been run their way leave him . 
the guard instinctively parry the blow with his rifle . 
he try to veer the rifle around to fire into mike 's body . 
mike , off balance , manage to bat the muzzle away a moment before it explode . 
the bullet go wide . 
mike swing the pistol in a savage backlash . 
this time it connect solidly on the man 's temple , fell him . 
the explosion of the rifle had crash against the walls of the stockade and the deep echoes were still roll in the hills . 
the startled horses begin rear on their tethers . 
dean came rush up . 
`` are you hit '' ? he demand . 
`` no , but the fat 's in the fire '' ! 
mike say . 
`` there 's no chance now of all_of us get_away . 
you 'll have_to try it alone '' . 
the sentry 's saddled horse stand picket nearby , having been keep handy in_case of need . 
mike take the bayonet from dean 's hand and slash the picket_line . 
`` up you go '' ! he say . 
`` ride '' ! 
dean resist mike 's attempt to push him toward the horse . 
`` why not you '' ? he protest . 
`` dammit '' ! 
mike say frantically . 
`` you be lighter than me . 
it be our only chance now . 
try to find these feds . 
the rest of us can fort_up in the house and hang_on until you get_back . 
you be the one that 's take_a_chance the big chance '' . 
dean still hesitate , but mike lift him almost bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand . 
`` no tell how good this horse be '' , mike pant . 
`` favor him and save something in_case you hit trouble . 
watch out for apaches when it comes daylight . 
take the pistol . 
you might need it . 
we 'll still have the rifle , and i might be able to round_up some more . 
i 'll stampede the rest of these horses so they can n't chase you '' . 
dean lean from the saddle and gave him a mighty whack on the back . 
`` mclish '' , he say as he kick the horse into motion , `` i 'd be a mighty sad man if we never meet again '' . 
then he be on his way at a gallop . 
mike run down the line , slash picket ropes with the bayonet . 
he lift a screeching war_whoop . 
that touch_off a total stampede . 
he dart inside the stockade and free the horses there . 
these pour through the gate and join the flight . 
the animals thunder away into the moonlight , head for the ridges . 
the guerrillas were swarm from their bivouac at the west_end of the enclosure . 
`` ' paches '' ! 
mike yell . 
`` they 're steal ' the stock '' ! 
he scuttle in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and_then follow the south wall until he be at_the_rear of the two frame buildings . 
he crouch there . 
his shout had been take_up and repeat . 
the guerrillas were run across the parade_ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the departing horses . 
all were carry guns they had seize up , but they be half-clad or hardly clad at_all . 
durkin and calhoun come run from the post . 
they have pistols in their hands . 
they bawl questions that were not answer in the uproar . 
they follow the others toward_the_east gate . 
beyond the stockade rifles begin to explode as some of the guerrillas fire at shadows that they imagine be apaches . 
mike made a dash to_the_rear of the frame buildings . 
he crawl beneath the two supply wagons which stand between the buildings and peer around a corner . 
the area be deserted . 
a man was stand in_the_open door of the lighted orderly room a_few yards to mike 's left , but he , too , suddenly make_up_one's_mind and go race to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade . 
mike crawl to the door and peer in . 
the orderly room seem to be deserted . 
a lantern hang from a peg , give light . 
duck inside , he find that three rifles be stacked in a corner . 
a brace of pistols , holstered on belts , hang from a peg , along with ammunition pouches . 
an ammunition case stand open , contain canisters which contain powder cartridges . 
mike seize a blanket from a pallet in a corner , spread it on the floor and use it to form a bag in_which he place his booty . 
shoulder the load he peer from the door . 
his looting of the orderly room had take only a minute or two and the vicinity be still clear of guerrillas . 
he look at the looming hoods of the supply wagons , strike by a new inspiration . 
he set_down his bundle down . 
snatch the lantern from its peg , he shatter its globe with a blow against a post . 
he pick_up the powder canister and run_out . 
burst paper cartridges , he scatter powder beneath the nearest wagon and dump the contents of the canister upon it . 
he shoulder the blanket again , back_off , and toss the lantern with its open wick beneath the wagon . 
he turn and race across the parade_ground toward the rock house . 
powder flame gush beneath the wagon . 
the stockade be brilliantly lighted and the guerrillas sight him . 
they realize the truth . 
bullets begin to snap past him . 
one strike the muzzle of one of the rifles that project from the shoulder pack . 
its force spin him around , but he recover and get into stride again . 
a bullet tear the earth from beneath his foot when he be a stride or two from safety . 
another strike him heavily in the thigh and he go_down . 
guerrillas were race toward him . 
susan and julia come from the door and drag him with them . 
the three of them flounder through the door into_the_interior and fall in a heap . 
susan bounce to her feet and slam the door . 
she crouch aside as bullets beat at the portal , chewing into the planks . 
some tear entirely through the whipsawed post_oak . 
the iron hinges hold , but the planks be in danger of being tear from the crossbars . 
mike roll to susan , grasp her around the knees , drag her off her feet . 
he hover over her to shield her , for spent bullets were thud against the rear walls . 
he peer from a loophole . 
guerrillas be only a dozen yards away , charge the house . 
mike snatch a pistol from the heap of scattered booty and fire . 
he drop a man with the first bullet . 
at the same moment wheeler_fiske fire the rifle mike had give him and another guerrilla was hit . 
that halt the rush . 
the guerrillas scatter for cover . 
the wagons were burn fiercely . 
the mudwagon had catch_fire also . 
the blaze was spread to the frame buildings . 
the guerrillas realize they face a new problem . 
`` gawdamighty '' ! one screech . 
`` there go our grub an ' ammunition '' ! 
`` get a bucket line go '' ! 
calhoun shout . 
`` hurry ! 
hurry '' ! 
the guerrillas begin a frantic search for pails in_which to bring water from the spring . 
but what few containers they find be inadequate . 
many_of them , in increasing panic , come run with water in their hats in a ludicrous effort . 
both buildings be in_flames . 
the heat drive the guerrillas back . 
the roof of the command_post begin to buckle . 
`` drag the wagons to the spring '' ! 
lew_durkin yell . 
`` run ' em right into the spring ! 
hustle '' ! 
one of the wagons erupt a massive pillar of flame . 
a sizable supply of powder had been touch_off . 
the wagons and the coach be beyond saving and so be the buildings . 
the glow of the fire reach through the openings in the windows , give light enough to examine mike 's wound . 
the bullet had tear through the flesh just above the knee , inflict an ugly gash that was form a pool of blood on the floor . 
but it had miss the bone and had pass on through . 
susan and julia rip strips from their clothing and bind the injury . 
mike test the leg and find that he be able to hobble around on_it . 
`` so it was n't the earthquake that make him return to his village '' ! 
`` no . 
now dammit , i do n't want to go into any_more explanations . 
here come jason . 
keep this to yourself '' . 
reverend_jason , look worried , hurry toward us . 
`` anything wrong , cap ' n ? 
the men seem to think so '' . 
`` dirion find a large war party south of us . 
they 'll probably attack at dawn '' , montero say . 
he brush past the clergyman and walk into the center of the camp . 
use his hands as a trumpet he shout , `` fort_up ! 
fort_up ! 
there 's a large war party on their way '' ! 
for a second , engages , cooks , voyageurs appear struck dumb . 
then little_billy begin shout orders to round_up the ponies and fill the water buckets and for the cooks to hurry up with the meal . 
they all fly into action . 
`` that be a terrible thing to do '' , i say to oso . 
the aricaras treat us like friends . 
and here all_the_time you know the sioux would be use our rifles on them ! 
god , what a world you people live in `` . 
oso give me an unruffled look . 
`` old_knife 's have_got the largest war party ever see on the river '' , he say calmly . 
`` what would you have do in montero 's moccasins ? 
let old_knife come_up and kill you and your people , or would you steer him on someone else '' ? 
he shake his head . 
`` mr. manuel do that in the war . 
that be why the_british never get the tribes to fight for the king . 
mr._manuel whisper in the ears of the sioux that the cheyennes were comin ' to raid ' em for their horses . 
then he go_on to the cheyennes and tell them that the sioux was goin ' to move_up . 
he do that with all the nations . 
hell , they were fight ' each other so hard they have no time for anyone else . 
the war_department write mr._manuel a letter and say he be a hero . 
i see that letter . 
he carry it in a_little wallet make of fish skin '' . 
`` but that be war '' , i say . 
`` there 's no war on now '' . 
`` you be wrong , matt . 
in_this country there 's a war on every time the grass turn green . 
first it was the nations against themselves , then it was them against the whites . 
and it 's goin ' to go_on like this year after year until the white people take_over this land '' . 
i remember being tell it would happen so fast people would think it take_place overnight . 
`` that be why this company 's important . 
once we get_over the mountains others will come_along . 
that be why the trust do n't want us to make_it . 
that bastard chambers ! 
- old_knife 's not the only chief he 'll get to do his dirty work ! 
before we get_through he 'll have the blackfeet hanker ' for our hair and our goods . 
well , talkin ' ai n't goin ' to help - let 's fort_up '' ! 
as i dig_in behind one of the bales we were use as protection , i grudgingly find myself agree with oso 's logic , especially when i imagine what would have happen to missy if old_knife 's large party of screeching warriors had overrun our company . 
for , unlike the sioux and the crows , the aricaras be not great horsemen , nor be they aggressive like the savage blackfeet . 
more of an agricultural nation , they have rely_on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the plains . 
still , i be disgusted with myself for agree with montero 's methods . 
surprisingly , he had tell the others what he had do . 
in the brief moment i have to talk to them before i take my post on the ring of defenses , i indicate i was sicken by the methods men employ to live and trade on the river . 
`` i think montero do right '' , amy say firmly . 
`` let the savages kill each other what do we care '' ? 
reverend_jason be understandably bitter . 
`` it be a terrible thing to do . 
those little children '' . 
but oso reply calmly , `` trouble be n't easy to dodge out in_this country , rev_'_rend '' . 
gray_eyes attack our camp just_as the first pink threads stitch together the hills and the sky . 
our camp be in_the_center of a wide valley . 
montero had set_up a strong position , use every bale and box we have in_addition to barricades of logs and brush . 
he had order the ponies bring inside the fortified circle and had assign pierre and a band of picked engages the job of try to keep them steady under_fire . 
the pony herd be the one flaw in our defense ; the rees undoubtedly would try to cut_down as_many of the animals as possible . 
wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors . 
the cooks had prepare one of the best meals we 'd have in a long_time , and on montero 's orders had bake enough bread to last the day . 
buckets were fill , the herd feed and water . 
the worst part had be the waiting ; although we did n't expect the attack before dawn , the long cloudy night , filled with the sounds of the industrious insects , seem endless . 
coyotes and hunting wolves sound like signaling indian scouts , the whinny of a restless pony make one 's skin crawl . 
oso sleep unconcernedly , his rifle cradle in his arms ; i did n't catch_a_wink . 
every time i close my eyes , i see gray_eyes rush at me with a knife . 
it be a relief when they finally come . 
they pour through the opening in the valley , then spread_out in a long line to come at us , brandish their lances and fill the morning with their spine-chilling scalp cry . 
`` oso '' , montero call `` i 'll get gray_eyes '' . 
`` that 'll be a pleasure to see '' , the big black murmur as he stare down the barrel of his rifle . 
`` hold your fire '' , montero was shout . 
`` wait until my shot . 
i 'll shoot the first man who does n't '' . 
i could see them in my sights . 
they be about a mile off ; under me the ground quiver slightly . 
at_first they be only feathers and dark indistinguishable faces and bodies , hunch_over their horses ' heads . 
gradually they emerge as men . 
gray_eyes be in_the_lead . 
his face was split by a vermilion streak , his eyes be pools of white ; jagged red and black medicine symbols cover his chest . 
he be naked except for a clout . 
next to him be a young boy i be sure had sit near me at one of the trading sessions . 
his mouth be open , his neck corded with the strain of his screams . 
i find his chest in my sights . 
it have a red circle . 
the circle come nearer and nearer . 
my god , how long is he going_to wait , i think . 
montero 's rifle crack . 
at_first i think he had miss . 
gray_eyes remain erect . 
the feathered lance be still above his head . 
as he start to slump over , another warrior swing him onto his horse . 
i squeeze the trigger . 
at the last second i drop my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony . 
i see the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior fly over its head , bounce like a rubber ball . 
he start to run but oso 's shot catch him on the wing . 
he jerk once in the grass and lie still . 
`` if you 're goin ' to kill ' em - kill ' em '' ! 
oso growl . 
what else he say was lose in the rattle of gunfire on_all_sides . 
the aricaras break under the devastating fire , wheel and retreat . 
`` lead_up ! 
lead_up ! 
they 'll be back '' ! 
montero was shout . 
far up the valley i could see the rees circle and reorganize . 
out in_front of our walls the grass was cover with dead and dying men , war shields , lances , blankets and wounded and dead horses . 
the morning air be filled with the sweetish odor of new-spilled blood , the acrid stench of frightened horses , and the bitterness of burned powder . 
a horse scream as it twist from side to side in a frenzy . 
a rifle crack ; the square head fall_over . 
one of the warriors suddenly leap to his feet and begin run across the valley to the trees that line the small creek . 
his legs pump furiously , his long black hair stream out behind him . 
there be a ragged volley . 
he be dead before he hit the ground . 
`` for christ 's sake , do n't waste your powder on one of ' em '' ! 
montero shout furiously . 
`` wait for the charge ! 
the charge , i tell you '' ! 
the sharp cries at the end of the valley be faint . 
they grow louder as the indians charge again . 
i could see their faces glisten with sweat and bear_grease , their mouths open , shout their spine-chilling cries . 
`` gray_eyes be back '' , montero say . 
the war captain had been badly wound and was fight to hold his seat . 
i could see the blood run down his chest . 
he was ride between two warriors , who hold him erect when he start to slump . 
i forget to aim . 
in my sights i watch him loom bigger and bigger . 
montero 's shot had catch him high in the chest ; there be no_doubt he was die . 
again we wait for montero . 
this time he delay so_long that some of the engages shout frantically , but they hold their fire . 
the horses be only several lengths away when he fire . 
the bullet fling gray_eyes from his horse . 
our rolling volley sweep most_of the other riders from their mounts . 
but a_few reach our wall . 
i hear the whir of an ax and a canadian 's face burst apart in a bloody spray . 
i see little_billy rise and fire almost point blank and an indian 's face become shattered flesh and bone . 
a second leap from his horse to the top of the bale , fire four arrows in such rapid succession it did n't seem possible they be in flight . 
men scream . 
oso reach up , jerk the buck from the bale and snap his neck . 
other indians were run at the ponies , shrill and wave blankets . 
reverend_jason get one , the canadians the others . 
i see the clergyman kneel for a moment by the twitch body of the man he had shoot , then run back to his position . 
the ponies be almost uncontrollable . 
the pall of dust they raise make it difficult to see when the aricaras charge again . 
this time more of them hurdle the barrier . 
a small indian dive at montero , who catch him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle_butt . 
it sound like a man kick a melon . 
above me a dark rider was whip his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales . 
although my shot kill his horse , he roll off the bale on top of me . 
i could smell woodsmoke , grease , and oil . 
his eyes be dark , fluid , fearful , and he give a sigh as my knife go_in . 
come over the wall he had seem like a hideous devil . 
now under me i could see him for what he really be , a boy dress_up in streaks of paint . 
the aricaras make one last desperate charge . 
it be pitiful to see the thin ranks of warriors , old and young , wheel and twist their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumble bleed from their saddles by the relentless slam , slam of the cruelly efficient hawkinses . 
others , badly wounded , grip hands in manes , knees in bellies , hold_on as long as possible and_then , weak from ghastly wounds , slip sideways , slowly , almost thoughtfully , to be break under the slashing hoofs . 
some gracefully soar from the backs of their wounded , screaming mounts to make one last defiant charge before the lead split their hearts or tear their guts . 
none of them reach our walls again . 
the few survivors grudgingly turn_away . 
in the distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song . 
such be my state_of_mind that i did not question the possibility of_this ; under_the_circumstances i be only_too willing to confess all . 
i be nearly thirty at_the_time . 
i go_to the hall in the afternoons only , on these preliminary matters . 
it be dark and , i sense , very large ; only the counter at one end was light by a long fluorescent tube suspend directly above it . 
sometimes i be aware_of people move about in the darkness . 
i would turn away from my writing in the hope of get_a_look a good look at them but i never quite succeed . 
a glimpse of three of four vague figures , at_the_most . 
drift here_and_there . 
squat , as if wait . 
the pulse glow of a cigarette . 
since they could see me but i not them , their presence in the hall disturb me . 
the clerk pay_attention them no attention . 
this impress me , until i realize how limited be his sphere_of_influence . 
his job simply consist_in register new men . 
when the phone ring he answer it . 
his authority extend_to the far edge of the counter , no further . 
none of the men hang_around the hall bother to speak to him . 
baldness was attack his pate . 
he speak_to me in a gruff voice , an affectation which quite belie his personality . 
he wear his white shirt open at the neck , reveal a_bit of scrawny pale chest underneath . 
it be obvious that he wish himself different from the sort_of person he think he be . 
but it be not easy for him and he often slip . 
when one of the men in the hall behind us spit on the floor and scrape his boot over the gob of spittle i notice how the clerk wince . 
i feel certain he be really a spineless little man . 
his hat ( the cause of his baldness ? ) 
hang on a hook on the wall , and underneath it i could see his tie , knotted , ready_to be slip over his head , a black badge of frayed respectability that ought never to have_left his neck . 
the morning 's tabloids be on the counter , and a stack of dog-eared men 's magazines . 
on a shelf in the office behind the counter be a small radio dial permanently on a station which broadcast only vulgar commercials and cheap popular_music . 
everything about the clerk be trivial . 
once , press him , i learn that his job be only part-time , in the afternoons when nothing go_on in the hall . 
notice my disappointment he attempt to salvage what scraps and shreds of authority he feel might still be cling_to his person . 
with distaste i see him assume a pompous air . 
when he see me come he turn_off his radio off . 
he make a show of rearrange my forms on the shelf . 
he would pick_up the ringing phone with studied negligence , then bark into it with gruff importance . 
what limited knowledge he possess he force upon me . 
in the mornings , i was inform , fluorescent tubes , similar to the one above the counter , illuminate the entire hall . 
they , and the two large fans which i could dimly see as daylight filter through their vents , down at the far end of the hall , could be turn_on by a master switch situated inside the office . 
he point_out the switch to me and for a moment i foolishly believe that he would let deed follow words . 
i was show , instead , a batch of white tickets of the sort hand_out , he tell me , every morning . 
now , here was something of obvious importance to me , yet when i reach for the tickets he snatch them away from my hand . 
he could n't afford to have anyone mess_around with them , he say . 
each of those tickets be of great value to its rightful recipient . 
i withdraw my hand . 
later i would remember what this pompous little man had tell me about the worth of a ticket . 
have nothing else to do except wait for my forms to be process , i give myself over to speculations concern the hall itself . 
when suitably light , what would it look_like ? 
the presence of the two exhaust_fans seem to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air . 
one afternoon , upon receive permission and the necessary instructions from the clerk , i had visit the toilet adjoining the hall . 
by count the number of stalls and urinals i attempt to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold at_one_time . 
for although i had cross a corner of the hall on my way to the toilet i still could not tell for_sure how far to_the_rear the darkness extend . 
i could observe the two fans down at the end , but their size in themselves mean nothing to me as long as i have no measure of comparison . 
i had for_some_time been hope , in_vain , for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan vents and myself . 
i know that three or four of them be almost always present in the hall , but what they were do , and exactly where , i could not tell . 
it be , i feel , possible that they be men who , having receive no tickets for that day , had remain in the hall , to sleep perhaps , in the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light . 
this light did not penetrate very far back into the hall , and my eyes were hinder rather_than aid by the dim daylight enter through the fan vents when i try to pick_out whatever might be lie , or squat , on the floor below . 
also the clerk appear to disapprove of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder . 
no sooner would i turn my head away from the counter before he would address me , at_times quite sharply , in_order_to bring_back my attention . 
and i had hardly finish my business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion when the lights in_that place , like the hall lights control from the switch in the office , flick off_and_on impatiently . 
this sort_of petty vigilance annoy me . 
i feel certain it be self-appointed . 
it spring from a type of mentality i 'd encounter often enough but certainly had not expect to find here . 
i decide to see no_more of the clerk until the processing of my papers be completed . 
i feel strongly attached to the hall , however , and hardly_a day pass when i did not go to look at it from a distance . 
i live in a state of suspense because of_it . 
i could not cling to my past nor did i wish to . 
i had sign it off on the forms . 
my future lie solely with the hall , yet what did i know about the hall at this point ? 
although i had be inside it i had not_yet see it function . 
i wish to prepare myself but did not even know what sort_of clothes i ought_to be wear . 
i did not despair , however ; far from_it ! 
i was constantly search for clues around the neighborhood of the hall . 
though only a relatively short walk separate it from my own part of town , its character be wholly foreign to me . 
large warehouses flank the street on_which the hall front . 
the river be only a_few blocks away but an unbroken line of piers prevent me from see it . 
sometimes i notice the tops of ships ' masts and funnels reach above the pier roofs . 
the sounds issue from beyond - winches whir , men shout - indicate great activity and excite me . 
the hall , on_the_other_hand , appear lifeless and deserted on these long waterfront afternoons . 
it resemble nothing i 'd ever see before . 
its front be windowless , but irregularities in the masonry might be an indication that windows , now blinded , had once look_out_on upon the street . 
i keep circle the block hope to see , from the street behind it , the rear of the hall . 
but it be not a tall structure and other buildings conceal it . 
for weeks i wander about this neighborhood of warehouses and garages , truck terminals and taxi repair_shops , gasoline_pumps and longshoremen 's lunch counters , yet never did i cease to feel myself a stranger there . 
i return to the hall , despite my dislike for the clerk . 
as i had expect , he insist that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application . 
meanwhile spring had pass well into summer . 
at_last , when i put it to him directly , the clerk was force to admit that the delay in my case be unusual . 
when i ask him what , if anything , i could do about it , he surprise me by refer me to the director of the hall . 
i could consult this personage on any weekday morning , though not before ten o ' clock . 
the clerk impress this upon me : that i should not arrive in the hall before ten o ' clock . 
when i go for my interview with the director i see why . 
although it be dark as_usual i could see that the hall had only recently contain a great many people . 
cigarette_butts litter the floor . 
the big fans were go , draw from the large room the remnants of stale smoke which drift about in pale strata underneath the ceiling . 
i had feel the draft they were make while mount the stairs . 
the staircase itself seem still to be echo the heavy footfalls of many men . 
i stop by the counter . 
no one be behind it , but in the rear wall of the office i notice , for_the_first_time , a door which had been leave partially open . 
past it i could see part of a desk , a flag in a corner , a rug on the floor . 
the director 's office . 
i rap my knuckles on the counter . 
the director come to the door . 
i was at_once disappoint , although just what i had expect him to look_like i could not have explain . 
he be a man in his late forties , with graying hair , of medium height ; he look dapper in a lightweight summer suit , brown silk tie and green-tinted soft collar . 
he wear perforated , white-topped shoes ; they somehow make me expect to see him launch into a vaudeville tapdance routine any moment . 
but he come toward me sedately enough , show me around the counter , offer me a seat inside his office , then walk to a file_cabinet and get_out my application . 
i have the impression that he had read my forms , perhaps several_times . 
he did not look at them now . 
as he lower himself on the chair behind his desk i wonder what this dapper , slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the workings of the hall . 
he speak , in a voice as immaculate as his appearance . 
why had i register ? 
beg my pardon , he must express his astonishment over see a person of my background apply at the hall . 
he had look over my forms and was impress by what he had see there ; indeed , my scholastic qualifications be such_that he , a college graduate himself , must envy me them . 
be i sure , he ask , that i know what i was apply for ? 
what sort_of men i would come into contact with , at the hall ? 
these questions did not surprise me ; i feel certain that the director , like the afternoon clerk , seldom move beyond the counter , that the hall , to them , be a jungle , a dark and unwelcome place . 
though i doubt that he would understand me , i tell the director my motives for apply . 
i had always , i say , hanker after work hard with my hands . 
this desire , i go_on , grow voluble as my conviction was arouse , had mount at such a rate recently that i now find its realization necessary not_only to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing . 
to this effect i had already sever all connections which bind me to my former existence . 
the flat , hard cap be small , but he thrust it to_the_back of his head . 
`` tie him up '' . 
`` hell with_it '' . 
before they could guess his intention rankin step forward and swing the guard 's own gun against the uncovered head , hard . 
the man go_over without sound , fall to the bare floor . 
barton say harshly , `` why did you do that '' ? 
rankin sneer at him . 
`` what did you want me to do , kiss him ? 
he dump me in solitary twice '' . 
barton catch the lighter man 's shoulder and swing him around . 
`` let 's get one thing straight , you and me . 
the only reason we bring you be to get miller out . 
if you ever try anything without my orders i 'll kill you '' . 
fred_rankin look at him . 
it seem to barton that the green eyes mock him , the thin-lipped smile hold insolence , but he have no time to waste now . 
`` come_on . 
let 's move '' . 
they file_out through the guard-room door , into the paved square . 
there were three other men within this prison whom barton would have like to liberate , but they be in other cell blocks . 
there was no chance . 
they move slowly , toward the main gate , follow the wall . 
there was no moon . 
they had choose this_night purposely . 
they reach the guard house without alert the men on the walls above , and powers slip through the door . 
two men be on_duty inside , play pinochle , relaxed . 
they look up in surprise as powers come_in . 
`` what are you do out of the block '' ? 
`` it 's curtiss '' , he say , name the man rankin had hit . 
`` i 've got_to have help '' . 
they stare at him . 
the sergeant in charge climb to his feet . 
`` what 's wrong with him '' ? 
`` he 's have some kind_of a fit '' . 
the sergeant turn to the door . 
as he pass_through it barton shove his gun against the man 's side . 
`` one sound and you be dead '' . 
the sergeant freeze . 
powers had not follow . 
powers was cover the remaining guard . 
the man half reach for the cord of the alarm_bell . 
powers knock his arm aside . 
deliberately , with none of rankin 's viciousness , he lay the barrel of his gun alongside the guard 's head . 
they be free . 
even barton could not_quite believe it . 
it had go without a hitch . 
they slide through the wicket in the big gate , ghost across the dark ground . 
five minutes later they reach the horses . 
barton be relieved to see that carl_dill and emmett_foster had bring extra mounts . 
he had be worried that with miller and rankin add to the escape party they would be short . 
no one hurry . 
they walk the horses , head along the river , barton and emmett_foster in_the_lead , seven men ride quietly through the night . 
the only thing which would have attract attention be that two wear the uniform of prison_guards , three the striped suits of convicts . 
five miles . 
in a small grove against the river they halt , turn deep into the protection of the trees . 
foster had bring extra clothing also . 
a good man , emmett . 
he had be one of the original night_riders , one who had escape the trial . 
it was to him that barton had send carl_dill on dill 's release from the prison . 
clyde_miller was cry softly to himself , shed his striped suit and fumble into the nondescript butternut pants , the worn brown shirt . 
kid_boyd be unusually silent , rankin watchful , a_few paces apart . 
barton finish his dressing and extend his hand to powers . 
`` i won n't even try to thank you '' . 
the ex-prison guard be embarrassed . 
he say in a studied voice , `` i did n't do it for you . 
i do it for the valley . 
you be the only man the night_riders will follow . 
we 've been starve and i do n't like to starve '' . 
barton turn_away , his eyes fall upon rankin beside his horse . 
`` good_luck '' . 
the murderer lift his head . 
`` mean you want me to ride out '' ? 
`` you be n't one of us . 
there 's nothing for you here '' . 
`` i got no place to go '' . 
barton hesitate . 
he did not trust rankin , his violent temper , his killer instinct . 
but ten years in prison had teach him realities . 
they be in a fight , outweigh in both numbers and money . 
it be all_right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses , to call them night_riders , to set_out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever see if all they want be adventure . 
but if they really hope to succeed they need professionals , men who know how to use a gun against men , who would match the killers on the other side . 
`` your choice '' , he say briefly , and turn_to kid_boyd . 
`` bury those uniforms so they won n't be find '' . 
then barton touch carl_dill 's arm and move off , up the river bank . 
he want a careful , uninterrupted report from dill on the conditions in the valley . 
they squat on their heels in the deep mud and dill find a cigar in his breast_pocket , pass it over silently . 
he too know the agony of go for weeks , sometimes months without the solace of tobacco . 
mitchell_barton draw_in the fragrance deeply , let the smoke lie warm and soothing in his throat for a moment before he exhale . 
through the gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he know him thoroughly . 
for his first five years in prison , they had share a cell . 
carl_dill be neither a rancher nor a valley man . 
he had be the auditor for the mining syndicate , and he had steal fifty thousand dollars of the syndicate 's money . 
he had do time for the theft . 
the one thing they have in_common be their hatred . 
both hate donald_kruger . 
it had draw_together them together , and since his release from prison dill had work tirelessly to effect this_night 's escape . 
he say now , `` i have_got got the perfect headquarters set_up . 
the old haskell mine '' . 
mitch_barton know the place . 
twenty years before a group of easterners had buy_out the haskell claims in the rocky hills south of grass_valley . 
they had spend a_million dollars , carve in a road , put_up buildings , drill their haulage tunnel . 
then the vein had peter_out and the whole project had been abandon . 
`` the road be washed badly '' , say dill , `` but there 's a trail you can get_over with a horse . 
a company of cavalry could n't come_in there if two men were guard that trail '' . 
barton nod . 
`` how do the valley people feel '' ? 
`` as mad as ever . 
but kruger 's men keep them off balance , and they do n't trust me . 
i be an outsider . 
when they learn you be in the hills though , they 'll rally , do n't worry about that '' . 
barton wait for a long moment , then ask the question which lie always uppermost in his mind . 
`` my boy . 
did you find him '' ? 
dill be silent as if he hate to answer , and barton have a cold , sick feeling of apprehension . 
`` he be in morgan 's ferry '' . 
barton half straighten in surprise . 
`` what 's he do there '' ? 
again dill hesitate . 
`` deal faro '' . 
`` deal faro ? 
how_come '' ? 
`` your sister-in-law have the faro bank in cap_ayres ' saloon '' . 
barton curse under his breath . 
after another long pause he ask , `` how many people know who they be '' ? 
`` everyone . 
your cousin finley see to that . 
he be quite a rat , you know . 
he sell_out to kruger 's men . 
he 's inform them of everything you 've ever write him . 
he want your ranch '' . 
barton stand_up . 
he say tensely , `` all_right . 
let 's go get the boy '' . 
dill had come_up also . 
`` i be afraid of_this . 
i almost did n't tell you '' . 
`` if you had n't i 'd have kill you '' . 
dill 's voice tighten . 
`` but you can n't ride into the ferry . 
that be what they 'll expect you to do . 
they 'll be there wait for you . 
i understand how you feel about the child '' . 
`` the hell you do '' . 
barton 's voice be rougher than dill had ever hear it . 
`` i never see him . 
my wife die in childbirth after i was send_away . 
`` i can n't leave him there . 
donald_kruger would like nothing better than to hold him as hostage , and i would n't entrust a snake to his tender care . 
i 've got_to get the boy . 
let 's ride '' . 
barton 's men cut the telegraph_wires in half_a_dozen places , carry_away whole sections to make repairs more difficult . 
it be over an hour before their escape was discover , but still the news that barton be free flash across the central portion of the state . 
it reach donald_kruger in his massive home in burlingame . 
it reach the mines at north san_juan and bloomfield . 
it bring men out_of_bed and send them into hurried conferences . 
for everyone involved know that the whole valley be a powder_keg , and mitchell_barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence . 
creighton_hague sit in his office above the ione pit . 
the office be of logs , four rooms , each heat by an iron stove . 
the building was dwarf by the scene outside . 
there a dozen giant monitors play their seventy-five-foot jets of water against the huge seam of tertiary gravel which be the mountainside . 
the gravel be the bed of an ancient river , buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of earth . 
it was partially cement by ages and pressure , yet it crumple before the onslaught of the powerful streams , the force of a_thousand fire_hoses , and with the gold it hold wash_down through the long sluices . 
a_million dollars ' of gold a month . 
a_million tons of rock and soil and brush . 
the monitors run twenty-four_hours each_day . 
their roar , like the swelling volume of a_hundred tornadoes could be hear for miles . 
hague , like all who work near the_pits , be partly deafened from the constant assault against his eardrums . 
he be a big man , wear a neat flannel shirt against the cold foothill air . 
fat show in loose rolls beneath the shirt . 
ten years older than mitch_barton , he had claw his way up from mucker in the_pits to manager of the operation . 
he be proud_of his accomplishments , proud_of his job , proud that donald_kruger and his associates trust him . 
he live and breathe for the mining_company . 
no man could have reach his spot nor hold it without be ruthless , and hague had make a virtue of ruthlessness all_of his life . 
there come a ghost of noise at the office door and hague swing_around to see kodyke in the entrance from the outer room . 
hague had never accustom himself to kodyke . 
the man be tall , thin , with a narrow face and a too-large nose . 
the eyes always hold hague , eyes of a dead man , lidless as a lizard 's , with the fixed intensity of a cobra . 
even hague was repel by the machinelike deadliness that be kodyke . 
he know nothing about the man 's history . 
kodyke had appear at the mine one_day bear a letter from kruger . 
kodyke was to head the dread company police . 
he run the change rooms . 
he throw_out the hi-graders . 
he supervise the cleanups and handle the shipments of raw gold which each_week go_out to san_francisco . 
hague squeeze down his uneasy dislike . 
he pull open the top drawer of his desk and draw out a tintype . 
`` this be mitchell_barton . 
he break_out of folsom last night . 
apparently he bribe one of the guards . 
we want him back there or we want him dead '' . 
kodyke take the picture in a lean hand , study it thoughtfully . 
`` dangerous '' ? 
`` dangerous , yes . 
you know how the ranchers in the valley be . 
they blame us for all their troubles . 
ten years ago they blow_up some of our ditches . 
it cost us a_hundred_thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them . 
we do n't want barton 's night_riders loose again '' . 
the gunman nod , slip the picture into his breast_pocket , say nothing . 
normally hague waste no words , but now he find himself unable to stop their flow although he know kodyke be aware_of all he say . 
if she sense any unusual preoccupation on the part of her mother , she did not comment upon it . 
after they had finish eat , melissa take sprite the kitten under her arm - `` so_that auntie_grace can teach it about the whistle '' - and climb into the station_wagon beside her mother . 
she had offer to walk , but pamela know she would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally confide her to the care of the little pink woman who choose to be called `` auntie '' . 
when they reach their neighbor 's house , pamela say a_few polite words to grace and kiss melissa lightly on the forehead , the impulse prompt by a stray thought - of the type to_which she be frequently subject these days - that they might never see one another again . 
then she turn the station_wagon around and head it back down the hill , with the village as her ostensible destination . 
as she drive , she think_about her plan . 
it be really quite simple . 
so simple , in_fact , that it might even work - although pamela , now , in her new frame_of_mind , be careful not to pretend too_much assurance . 
that mistake , she think , had cost her dearly these past few days , and she want to avoid fall into any_more of the traps that the mountain might set for her . 
she must be cautious so as not to alert the scheming forest . 
when the station_wagon draw abreast_of the dusty dirt road that lead up to the porch of the culver house , pamela turn the wheel , guide the car to its familiar parking spot close_to the house , and stop . 
all_of her movements be careful and methodical , partake of the stealth of a criminal who has plot his felony for months in_advance and know exactly which step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime . 
she lock the ignition , remove the keys , step out of the car and go_into the house . 
here , she drop the keys on a small table beside the door and go upstairs to her bedroom . 
on her bureau lie a small , brass ornament of simple design and faded engraving - an object which , pamela believe now , had be the property of her great-grandfather , major_hiram_munroe_culver . 
he had belong_to this land and , perhaps , had desecrate it - and this be the only material symbol that remain of him . 
if she , pamela , were being hold responsible_for his crimes , then hers must be the final act of expiation . 
she would return this symbol to the mountain , as one pour seed back into the soil every spring & & & or as ancient fertility cults demand annual human sacrifice . 
slowly and thoughtfully , she slip the ornament into the pocket of her slacks , move down_the_stairs and out of the house . 
there was only one place where the mountain might receive her - that unnamed , unnameable pool harbor in its secret bosom . 
atonement , if atonement be possible , could only be make at that sacred , sacrificial basin . 
it be there that she would have_to enact her renunciation , beg forgiveness . 
perhaps it be insane , pamela think . 
perhaps it be all a vividly conceive dream . 
but she was catch in it , and she face the terrible possibility that , if it be a dream , it be one from which she might never awaken . 
face the forest now , she who had not dare to enter it before , walk between two trees at_random and head in_what she believe be the direction of the pool . 
she remember little of her previous journey there with grace , and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission would enable her to accomplish it . 
the forest be open and freely welcoming , extend an enchanted hand . 
the ground be covered with soft pine needles and the slope be gentle . 
birds chirp and chatter in the trees and the sun , all dewy-eyed and soft , caress her shoulders warmly from_time_to_time . 
it be not , think pamela , such an evil place after_all . 
no wonder melissa respond so completely to its beckoning . 
perhaps she have no reason to fear these trees that whisper their secrets above her head as she pass . 
was it not possible , after_all , that the forest be in league with her and her child , that its sympathy lie with the culvers , that she had err in fail to understand this ? 
pamela feel calm and peaceful as she walk along . 
the slight flutter that had disturb the motion of her heart when she enter the forest be gone now , and even the dim groves of trees through which she occasionally pass did not reawaken her fear . 
she regard them as signs that she was near the glen she seek , and she be glad to at_last be do something positive in her unenunciated , undefined struggle with the mountain and its darkling inhabitants . 
having persist too long in deliberate ignorance and denial of the forces that threaten her , pamela be relieved now to admit their potency and to be take definite steps toward grapple with them . 
a_few days ago , she would have think such an expedition as this utterly ridiculous ; today , on_the_contrary , it seem utterly reasonable . 
she did not pause to consider what she would do if her plan should fail ; she direct all_of her mental and physical energy toward achieve this one goal . 
if , as she walk , her steps fumble from_time_to_time , she choose to ignore that omen . 
if the slope grow steeper and the groves more dim , she try not to heed . 
success depend_upon maintain her equanimity ; she must be poised and proud and unafraid in_order_to prove to the mountain that she be in_earnest . 
the forest take_on an impersonal aspect . 
it did not care what sort_of person prowl its woods , pluck at its bark or strip the berries from its bushes . 
unconcerned , indifferent , unmotivated , the forest be simply there - fight man 's depredations with more abundant growth and man 's follies with its own musical evening laughter . 
red_man or white_man , pacifist or killer , the forest would accept them all - know that it could thrive equally well on slaughter and beneficence ; know that its ageless mass would always dwarf the short span of time allot to any man . 
pamela shake her head . 
she must_not think_about time . 
that be another one of those traps . 
in her grim pursuit of tranquillity , pamela focus her thoughts on her husband . 
if , when this be all_over , she find the words to tell him about it , she wonder if he would ever understand . 
how could he comprehend her need when he himself be innocent ? 
indian ghosts would not impinge upon his nights , nor would his days be haunt by the dimly-outlined , ill-conceived figure of her benighted ancestor . 
his bright , daylight mind would whistle away such images ; they would not dare to face his scoffing . 
pamela be glad jim be nowhere near . 
his presence would have interfere with her duty . 
the mountainside grow steeper and she slip once or twice on the smooth pine needles . 
the trees huddle more closely together , their limbs and leaves intertwined in a coarse curtain against the sun . 
bushes and vines abet the rocks in form thorny detours for the struggling stranger , and without the direct light of the sun to act_as compass , pamela could no_longer be positive of her direction . 
nevertheless , she continue to move upward . 
she be sure she would reach the pool by climb , and she cling to that belief despite the increasing number of obstacles . 
the forest had become an alien world where she strive , alone , unprotected , unguided , to deal with whatever hindrances were offer . 
it be a bold , dark castle of pine boughs that stand like a medieval fortress , eclipse the sun and human time . 
at one_and_the_same time , she be within it but still search for the drawbridge that would give her entry . 
silence come into the forest - a solid being that clap its hand over the murmur mouths of the_birds and the whispered comfort of the trees . 
silence walk at pamela 's side , its presence numbingly close , yet too far for her to hear . 
silence stand in front of her , wait , and in back of her , block her retreat . 
she stumble over the root of a tree that protrude maliciously above the earth . 
in_spite_of her attempt to preserve her balance , she fall , bruise her arm on a naked stone . 
for a moment , she could not catch her breath and_then , her breath return in_short , frightened spasms , she lift herself to her feet laboriously . 
she start to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her clothes . 
her arm bleed slightly , and the offended skin cry_out in pain . 
she look_around . 
she be bewildered . 
she seem to have come such a long distance - too far for her destination which had wilfully been swallow_up in the greedy gloom of the trees . 
she stand quite still , try to focus upon a direction in_which to turn , a path to follow , a clue to guide her . 
she was stand in a thick grove . 
the trees be crowded so closely together that their branches overlap , virtually shut_out the sun completely . 
the earth smell moist and pungent as it might in a cave deprived_of the cleansing effect of the sun 's rays . 
she have the feeling that , under the mouldering leaves , there would be the bodies of dead_animals , quietly decay and give their soil back to the mountain . 
the thought make pamela shudder . 
a terrible chill sweep through the grove . 
not a breeze exactly , but a pocket of icy air that settle with a loathsome familiarity upon the deep confines of the grove , catch pamela in a leering embrace . 
there was a peculiar density about it , a thick substance that could be sense but never identify , never actually perceive . 
where before had she feel or dream or imagine such a scene ? 
she already know this unwholesome , chilling atmosphere that be somehow grotesquely alive . 
it enclose her clammy hands and twine around her ankles . 
it creep into the open neck of her blouse and slide down her body , seep into her flesh through all the quivering pores of her skin . 
it crawl across her breasts , suffocate the life in her nipples . 
it circle her thighs , explore with its icy tentacles . 
it enter her body with the ghastly intimacy of an incubus , and its particles , spread , creep , crawl , join themselves into steel_bands that constrict her knees so tightly that they ache ; stifle her lungs so_that her breath come in harsh gasps ; clutch her throat and suck_up the moisture in her mouth so_that her tongue be dry and hard and stuck_to the roof of her mouth and her teeth be clenched together in the rigid fixture of her jaws . 
she have to get_away from here before_this demoniac possession swallow_up the liquid of her eyes and sink into the fibers of her brain , deprive her of reason and sight . 
but she did not know which way to go . 
the shadows of the trees engulf her , foreclose every possible exit from the grove . 
she had been snare here by a vile sensuality that writhe around her throat in ever-tightening circles . 
she could not scream , for even if a sound could take_shape within her parched mouth , who would hear , who would listen ? 
does the mountain listen ? 
pamela grope blindly . 
she have to escape . 
she have to move in some direction - any direction that would take her away from this evil place . 
she thrust forward through the shadows and the trees that resist her and try to fling her back . 
her own body protest , ache painfully where the blood in her veins had congeal , where cold demon wisps still cling and caress . 
every movement she make seem unnecessarily noisy . 
twigs crack loudly under her feet ; bushes swish and scratch at her slacks ; tree_branches snap as she push them ruthlessly away from her . 
people come in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it . 
the room fill with smoke , and maggie 's head throb with_excitement and fatigue , but stuart have such a happy , earnest look of proud possession on his face that maggie could n't bear to do anything to quench it . 
little_anne rapidly outdistance her mother in recovery . 
in two months she become a fat highly social baby , with a fuzz of flaxen hair all_over her head . 
she stop fly into rages and start digest her food ; she develop a peaches and cream complexion and a sunny disposition , and she ask for nothing more of life than that she be keep dry and comfortable and feed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carry to where she could watch activity go_on around her . 
she be so heavy that maggie 's arms shake from lift her and take care of her . 
maggie could n't seem to get her strength back or catch_up_with herself with all she have to do : there was the big basket of clothes to be coax through the rackety old washer and lug out and lug back ; there was the daily round of household chores in_which maggie insist on participate . 
worry have a great_deal to do with_it ; stuart had been lay_off at the produce company and have to go_back to sit in his father 's office , take what salary his father could hand_out to him . 
mr._clifton would have prefer death and bankruptcy to have his son stay with his wife 's people without contribute to his and his family 's upkeep , and besides that there were the things that have to be buy for the baby , milk and orange_juice and vitamins and soap , just plain soap . 
maggie and stuart pore over figures every_night , try to find how they could squeeze_out a_few pennies more . 
in desperation maggie consult eugenia one afternoon : 
`` do you think you could find me something i could do here at_home to make some money , so i could still watch the baby and do the rest of the things '' ? 
`` it seem to me you have enough to do as_it_is '' , eugenia say . 
she had been watch maggie go from the washing_machine to the baby to the stove and back again . 
`` i have plenty of odd moments when i could be do something '' , maggie say . 
`` it would make me feel a_lot better , but the woman 's exchange is n't take baked_goods any_more and i can n't leave the baby with grandma because she be n't strong enough and the baby 's too young to be put in a nursery '' . 
`` i should think so '' , eugenia say . 
`` for_one_thing you can stop keep that child in starched dresses and change from the skin out nineteen times a day '' . 
`` she be so beautiful , and i do like to keep her looking nice '' . 
maggie say . 
she pick_up the baby and nuzzle her fat warm little neck . 
`` she 'll be just_as beautiful in something that does n't have to be iron '' , eugenia say . 
`` evadna_mae_evans say she did n't put a thing on her child but a flannel wrapper until it be nine months old '' . 
`` evadna_mae_evans get all her baby clothes from best 's liliputian_bazaar in new_york , and i be sick and tired_of hear about evadna_mae_evans '' . 
`` well now , maggie , you do n't have to snap at me '' , eugenia say . 
`` i 'm just think_of a way for you to be sensible '' . 
`` i be sorry . 
i do seem to snap at everybody these days , but i would like to think_of a way to make a_little extra money '' . 
`` well , let 's see . 
let 's make a list of your assets '' . 
maggie start laugh , and she laugh so hard she could n't stop , and she keep_on laugh while she lug the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still shine . 
when she come_back eugenia was sit at the kitchen_table with a pencil and envelope jot_down words and figures . 
`` i have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working mothers '' , eugenia say . 
`` we could put_up cribs on the second floor sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a playroom where it 's nice and sunny , but of_course it would entail quite a_bit of run up and down stairs and chris say you were to be careful about that '' . 
`` what else '' ? 
`` you might set_up a dress_shop in the living_room '' . 
`` every woman in the block has try that '' . 
`` what about a tea_room , then ? 
you could set_up tables in the front_room and serve salads and your baked beans and brown_bread and grandma could dress like a gypsy and tell fortunes '' . 
`` it be too elaborate . 
and grandma be n't strong enough to take_on something like that , and to tell you the truth neither be i '' . 
eugenia sigh . 
she say , `` well , those be the really interesting things , but if you do n't like any of those i can turn_over some of my extra typing jobs to you , if you think you can type well enough '' . 
`` oh , i be sure i could do that '' , maggie say . 
`` but it really would n't be fair , take your jobs away from you '' . 
`` do n't worry , i can get plenty more '' , eugenia say , wonder where in the world she could . 
maggie was look much happier already , clear a space on the table and chatter about how she could put_up a typewriter right_there , and be brush_up on her typing so eugenia would n't be ashamed of_it . 
`` and_then whenever i have a minute i can be work_at it , and keep_an_eye_on the baby and the stove at_the_same_time . 
and i can go_back to my contests and be think while i 'm do the washing '' . 
`` what are you going_to do with your feet so you do n't waste anything '' ? 
maggie laugh . 
she say , `` oh eugenia , i wish & & & '' . 
`` what '' ? 
`` i wish i have three wishes '' , maggie say . 
`` all_of them for you '' . 
it grow bitterly cold toward the end of november , contribute to the miseries of countless numbers of people . 
the temperature drop to twenty below at night and stand at zero during the days . 
the cold settle like a tangible pall over the mile_high_city , lock it in an icy grip that harshen its outlines and alter its physical appearance ; it have a look of grim stark realism , resemble other cities whose habitual climate be cold , instead of the sprawling bumptious open-handed greedy western city bask in eternal sunshine at the foot of mountains store with endless riches and resources . 
the jobless huddle in the streets outside of employment offices , outside newspaper buildings , in parks , in relief lines , outside government agencies . 
there were n't facilities to take_care of them ; there never had been a need feel for such facilities . 
that kind_of poverty was regard_as the exclusive property of the east , which create depressions with their stock_markets and their congested populations and their greedy centralization of industries , protect by discriminatory freight_rates . 
the east was popularly suppose to have get the country into war and into depression , drag the west along ; and now the east was create government agencies for which the west doubtless would have to pay . 
the government_offices were being open but they were n't being open fast enough and meanwhile the cold penetrate everything . 
shiver , people talk and argue ; all this government spending would have to be pay for somehow , but on_the_other_hand desperate circumstances call_for desperate remedies and something have to be do . 
something have to be do ; it be the theme_song of millions of american people , their personal problems no less urgent than those of the government . 
something have to be do . 
the abernathys say it to each other a dozen times a day . 
something have to be do about the furnace , the fuel bills , the washing_machine , the doctor and dentist bills , about make money stretch for food , for the mortgage , for taxes , for shoes , for half_soles , for overshoes , for clothes , for the new leaks in the roof , for gas and light bills ; about keep warm , about keep well , about meet the minor emergencies that come_up once , twice , fifty times a day . 
just drop the baby 's bottle and break it become a catastrophe , and stuart wear_out his shoes so fast that he was term a major disaster . 
the abernathy furnace consume fuel like a giant ravenous maw that have to be appease by hurl tons of coal into its evil red depths , and no_matter_how much coal they put_in the house remain cold . 
cold come_in the innumerable cracks that seem to have spring_up , under doors , around loosened window_frames , from the sleeping porches , the attic , from the widened cracks between shingles on the roof . 
presently they have to give_up run the furnace at full capacity and depend_on the old coal range in the kitchen , which had never been remove when the new gas_range was install , and the fireplaces and an electric_heater in grandma 's room . 
it be so cold and so wretched that a sort_of desperate gaiety infect all_of them , like people stormbound or shipwrecked or catch in some other freak of circumstance so_that time stand_still and minor anxieties fall_away and the only important thing be to cling together and survive . 
the pipes burst and they all laugh and stand in ice_water to their ankles while they swab the bathrooms . 
they live mainly in the kitchen ; they move maggie 's bed and the baby 's basket there , and the rest of them undress by the stove and run groan and shiver to the upper polar regions and plunge into icy beds . 
grandma say it be just like the early mining camp days , and it be the way people ought to live , only she was get too old to take the pleasure from_it that she used_to . 
`` you say a mouthful '' , eugenia say grimly . 
eugenia hate be cold worse than anything , and she was begin to find the joys of poverty wear_thin . 
she say to maggie that it be one thing to meet an emergency and another to wallow in it , and it was begin to look at if this one was going_to last forever . 
`` plenty of people be poor all their lives '' . 
`` plenty of people have n't our brains and talent '' . 
`` i know you when you start talk_about brains and talent '' , maggie say . 
`` you 're work_up to something , and if you do n't watch_out you 'll ruin your whole life one_of_these_days just to prove that the abernathy family be superior to everything , even a depression '' . 
`` the only thing that worry me be how i 'm going_to prove it '' , eugenia say . 
they beg grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her , but grandma say she was get too old to sleep in strange beds and be see with her teeth out , and that she hope to die in privacy like a christian and if the lord will it to be of pneumonia than it would have to be that way . 
she did n't want to be the only one with a stove in her room , especially as her life span was nearly run_out anyway , and she insist that hope have the heater . 
hope would n't hear of it , and she take_back the heater back to grandma 's room , and grandma take_back it back to hope 's room , and the two of them drag it back_and_forth until grandma tip it over and almost set_on_fire her bedspread on_fire . 
she say that prove she was n't to be trust with a fire in her room , and she could be burn to a crisp without anybody know it . 
eugenia suspect her of deliberately overturn the heater because she was get tired of drag it back_and_forth and still want her own way , but hope say if grandma would n't have the heater nobody would have it , so grandma have to give_in . 
`` thrifty of her to use_up it up . 
unusual in a case like this , but '' - 
`` you can joke ! 
did n't you read it ? 
she 's marry that tenant ! '' 
`` i read it , yes . 
this ought to simplify tolley 's life '' . 
laban have more to say . 
tolley had go to live in california . 
he 'd mention it , himself , at church and everybody seem to have the idea that tolley had leave because jenny had jilt him for roy robards . 
`` it be plain as the nose on your face that they 're laugh about it , mamma . 
zion stay to get my pin , but it 'll be a cold day in june when i go_back '' . 
`` we will both go_back , laban '' ! 
kizzie turn to go inside . 
`` let me stay and take the pictures you want , mamma . 
the sun 's right '' - 
`` pictures '' ? 
she swing around . 
`` what pictures '' ? 
`` in brace 's room ! 
you tell me to bring my camera . 
i 'm not go_back '' - 
`` indeed you are ! 
why should i want pictures of an empty room now ? 
tolley have no idea of marry that sneaky little jenny ! 
this - trip of his have nothing to do with her consort with tenants , and i am going_to see that everybody at mt._pleasant understand that simple fact . 
wait for me , laban , i 'll be dressed in half a second '' ! 
frank follow her into the bedroom , hook her dress up the back . 
`` hurry , frank ! 
they 're not going_to laugh_at the fairbrothers and labans very long ! 
tolley 's going be my fault . 
i drive_away him away . 
you know it and i 'll tell everybody exactly how it happen '' . 
she be so beautiful , so valiant , so pitiable . 
he kiss her . 
`` make your confession to god , kizzie dear , not to the congregation '' . 
`` i 'll decide that when i get there . 
i be so cruel to tolley , so unfair . 
but i 'll be fair now ! 
he is come_back , is n't he , frank '' ? 
yes , oh yes . 
what else was_there to say ? 
return to the log-house he find some favorite lines from jonathan_swift on his lips : `` under the window in stormy weather i marry this man and woman together . 
let none but him who rule the thunder put this man and woman asunder `` . 
absolution for his lie ? 
he question god 's take time to telegraph the message , but he feel better about kizzie , and he take the sealed envelope from its pigeonhole , wonder why he had preserve it . 
if he die before she did , she would never be unable to resist open it . 
in_any_case he would be thrust a burden on his remaining sons , make them parties to a deception peculiarly his own . 
it be simply his necessity to confess which had make him write and keep this thing . 
`` you 've tell god , frank '' , he say . 
`` why lacerate the - congregation '' ? 
reach for an old clay pot , relic of pioneer days , he tear the envelope in pieces , drop them into it , touch the little pyre to flame , watch it curl , the red sealing_wax melt and bubble in the feathery ash . 
surely now his beloved son could rest_in_peace . 
`` ' and let me go , for the night gathers me , and in the night shall no man gather fruit '' ' . 
a beautiful and haunting line , a subtle genius , swinburne , difficult not to envy a gifted man , and perhaps he did . 
but there were great satisfactions , even for a small man . 
beyond his window be the greening trees , new spring , eternal hope , eternal_life . 
there lie grand_fair 's quinzaine , his own young parents ' graves , but new life and promise for his sons , grandsons . 
he pour his thimble of wine for the toast he 'd make so often . 
`` to absent loved_ones '' . 
but this last time he drink not to brace but `` to tolley '' ! 
mr._robards - jenny be the only person she know of in the mt._pleasant neighborhood who call him that - be kind but too easygoing . 
it did n't bother him for everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say , `` howdy , miss_jenny '' , add a careless `` roy '' , but it did her . 
he could put a stop to_it , she tell him again_and_again . 
simply call mr._whipsnade_oscar , and dr._dunne_p._g. , and c ' un major_frank . 
mr._robards laugh , say he 'd feel a damn fool , plain-out could n't do that even to please her . 
`` you could try . 
and if i ever hear you say ' mist_laban ' again i 'll scream . 
and do n't tell me you did n't at church sunday . 
i hear you '' ! 
he really had n't mean to , he assure her , but it be plain to her that the importance of these small things be lost on mr._robards . 
how strange it be that he could give her this handsome house and carte_blanche as to its beautiful furnishings , and fail her in - spiritual ways . 
another weakness - far more irritating than his manner_of_speaking , which he make only token effort to change - be his devotion to_that old horse of tolley 's . 
her horse , rather . 
but mr._robards ' now , oh my yes , indeed , yes ! 
he call her `` the mare '' much_as mrs._whipsnade speak of `` the queen , god bless her '' . 
he , with fifteen or twenty horses or mares or geldings or what-nots out there in the barn , be reverent only of `` the mare '' , `` the racin ' mare '' , the revolting gunny . 
for the first few months of their marriage she had try to be nice about gunny , go out with him to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall . 
and what had happen ? 
gunny invariably try to bite her . 
nerves , mr._robards say , just a nip anyway . 
`` stand_back , miss_jen , she be oneasy of your scarf '' . 
never , `` quit that , you sor ' l devil '' ! 
never concern for his wife 's nerves , or the danger that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in january . 
she mus n't annoy gunny whose foal be due then too ! 
listen for hours to his laments that the war and `` mist_fair 's '' poverty afterwards had rob the mare of many_a racing triumph , and to his predictions of greatness for the procession of foals to come , jenny could look_forward to years of conflict with an animal who dislike her intensely and show it . 
gunny symbolize so_much that be unpleasant - tolley , the indifference with which the fairbrothers and indeed the whole neighborhood now treat her and which she would die rather_than acknowledge to her husband , his lack of understanding and sympathy in her present condition , her disgusting swollen stomach . 
human birth be no novelty to mr._robards . 
tillie be a fine midwife and could get here quick , he suggest . 
jenny 's aversion to have dr._dunne , a former admirer , seem silly to him , but he would humor her , get anybody she want , the best never be too good for her . 
the chances be against his be here to humor her when her time come , she be sure . 
he would be in the barn , or ride for the veterinarian ! 
night after night he stay with gunny in the dead of winter , rub her with quarts of expensive liniment , fuss over her bran mash as the cook did over charlotte_russe , track manure on the pretty new carpet when he did come to the house . 
yet when the dear baby come , he had tillie over_here in a jiffy , and be as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when it be all_over as any husband could have be . 
jenny wish now that she had have dr._dunne , feel that somehow he would n't have allow the dear baby to turn_into triplets . 
there be something not nice about triplets , though their father seem pleased , show no disappointment that they had n't be the son he want , say , `` you do n't see triplets trippin ' down the pike ever ' day , miss_jen , hon . 
rhyme ' em up cute - arcilla , flotilla '' . 
edmonia for her mother , she say firmly , jennifer , for herself , and - . 
`` kezziah , for miss_kizzie '' , he suggest . 
`` she be mighty good to you past_times , an ' this 'll fetch her '' . 
now she must be think_of a boy-name , something special . 
just wait till she see the mare 's foal . 
handsomest colt in_all kentucky . 
strong too , up_on his legs when he be an hour old . 
what about royal_robards ? 
`` why do n't you name him jesus_christ ! '' 
she burst into tears . 
roy be deeply distressed . 
he 'd have no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had be . 
of_course she be n't herself right_now , but as her strength come_back her spirits did n't seem to rise with_it . 
he have a good idea why not . 
those elegant `` at_home '' cards she send_out , now she could wear her pretty clothes again , and have the house all trimmed up , had n't bring many callers in two whole months . 
doc_dunne and miss_sis had come . 
so had miss_shawnee_rakestraw , full_of criticisms about the changes here , give_thanks thanks that her dear old father had go to his heavenly_rest last year , say how much she enjoy her boarding_house in town in inclement weather , was look_forward to quinzaine_spa this summer . 
there be an idea . 
miss_kizzie had be right snippy ever since they were marry , though you 'd have think a namesake would have bring her round . 
oh , she 'd come to see them once , leave silver teething_rings for all_of the trips . 
but when miss_jen go over right_away to return the call , miss_kiz could n't have be very cordial , for she 'd come_back before she hardly have time to get there . 
more_and_more , these days , she 'd been drive that pretty little mare that look_like her , over to tillie 's and nick 's - his own old square frame box on posts , chickens and cats and pups under the house , everybody friendly inside , make a to-do over the babies dressed like dollies . 
though he be glad she get_on well with his young folks , she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land , too . 
it make him pretty hot_under_the_collar , after the idea miss_sis had give him , to be tell by miss_kiz that her holy spa be all reserved for this summer and next , if you please , and that_much as she regret it , they would be unable to entertain mrs._robards and the children . 
she hope they be_well . 
he did n't tell miss_jen , but she must have get_word from the cook or nurse , who of_course know those quinzaine nigs , and she really took a fit . 
if he ever do such a thing again she 'd die of shame . 
`` have a party an ' leave_out ' em out , hon '' , he suggest . 
`` a swell party , send an invite to ever ' body but them - those folks you meet at the galt_house , the ones i 've get to know in_this new jockey_club affair , the whole dang neighborhood . 
we 'll have oystchers - couple bar ' l oystchers 'll fetch in a crowd any time . 
i 'll see word get round '' . 
`` do n't you dare ! '' 
miss_jen be funny that way , funny that she did n't seem to take_to his ideas and perk_up . 
he be downright worried about her , but there was one more thing he could try . 
zion be surprised when roy 's buggy stop beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walk home from the country school where she was teach now that eph_showers had have a call to preach in some mountain town . 
roy smile - he did have a nice smile - take_off his hat most politely , tell her to hop in , and he 'd give her a lift to quinzaine . 
her hesitation be only momentary and she hope he did n't notice it , as she settle herself , ask quickly how miss_jenny and the babies were get_on . 
`` see for yourself , miss_zion . 
it won n't take a minute '' . 
he swing in through his own wide gateway . 
`` them be the purtiest babes you ever did see , but miss_jen get mighty lonesome . 
she 'll relish the sight of a friendly face . 
miss_kiz won n't care your come ' , will she '' ? 
`` why of_course not '' , zion say uncomfortably . 
`` he must have forgive me '' , henrietta murmur to the room . 
the absolution of doaty 's last will and testament be proof enough of_that ; doaty would never have leave her house to a godless woman . 
she find herself wish an old wish , that she had tell doaty she was run_away , that she had leave something more behind her than the loving , sorry note and her best garnet pin . 
perhaps doaty had guess already and keep her counsel . 
henrietta think , it 's extraordinary how much she always know about both of us . 
there had been more to know about hetty , inevitably , and most_of it unfavorable . 
adelia be the good one , or , if_not always good , less frequently tempt . 
their childhood would have be quite circumspect without hetty 's flair for drama , especially through the long summers . 
in winter , in the city , there had be the maneret_school , which teach excellently with a kind_of austere passion for knowledge ; there had be lessons in french from a small polish nobleman with a really profound distaste for his pupils ; there had be the dancing class - miss_craddock , thin and tireless , with her supervising wand and her everlasting one-two-three , one-two-three . 
there had be supper parties and teas , fetes and little balls , mama small and pretty and gay and papa enormously jocular , enormously possessive , the sun around which the blackwell planets revolve . 
mama had die before the corruption of the family_circle , the interruption of charles . 
it be safe to assume that papa , sigh heavily , had say many_times to his remaining daughter , `` thank god your poor mother was spare this '' , and indeed it might be true that it had be easier for henrietta to leave , with her hand in charles ' hand , just because her `` poor mother '' be gone already and would never know . 
mama be vulnerable ; one had always feel the need to make a safe world around her . 
but i would have go anyway , think henrietta . 
she had always be able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice . 
only at this moment - perhaps because it be before dawn and she was lie in doaty 's bed - she find herself examine how others might regard her . 
perhaps they would argue that morality consist_of just of_that ability to see a choice . 
she turn on her side , find the idea oppressive . 
if adelia had feel about someone as henrietta feel about charles , would she have run_away with him ? 
impossible to imagine adelia feel so about anyone . 
no temptation , no sin . 
no temptation , no virtue ? 
a curious thought to end a curious night . 
the_birds be really awake now in a colloquy of music , and light was begin to creep across the room , touch sill and door , table and chair and all_of doaty 's flowers in their artificial blossom and leaf . 
before_anything_else , she would go to doaty 's grave with flowers from doaty 's forgotten garden . 
everything must wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoid graveyards . 
she close her eyes , remember the small french cemetery , enclosed by stone_walls . 
it had always seem to rain there , and even the grass be gray . 
after the sad impatient moment , wait for comfort which could not come , she slip out_of_bed and go to the open window . 
the garden below be lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness . 
lean out , she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle , one not_quite come_to bloom , one just beyond it . 
on a thrusting spray thick_with thorns and dewdrops and swelling pink buds , like a summer valentine , a bird balance and sing , nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music , a_little engine of song . 
it be so pretty and artless that she feel like a child again and would have enjoy run_out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things , but doaty never permit bare feet and she be decidedly not a child but une femme d ' un certain age . 
feel suddenly neat and subdued , she dress quite soberly and go downstairs . 
rosa , unbelievably , be not_yet up and about , reassurance that rosa be human . 
feel protective toward this sleeping being , henrietta find a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug , a breakfast which be somewhat the equivalent of go barefoot . 
outside , the garden , the tame wilderness , yield a patchwork bouquet of daisies , sweet_william , scented stock and lady 's bedstraw , which she tie with long grasses and take back to show rosa , who was now stir about the kitchen and harangue folly . 
the poodle come gleefully to henrietta and beg for the flowers , supplicate the air with prayerful forepaws . 
henrietta hold her bouquet out_of_reach and say it be for doaty . 
`` rummage in the dew '' , say rosa coldly . 
`` go change your shoes before you turn_around '' . 
she sound so exactly like doaty that henrietta obey her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay home . 
folly dance , eager_for whatever lie beyond the door . 
to a blackwell , there was only one church . 
the cemetery slumber just behind it , and the way lie through the village and close_to the sea . 
for_the_first_time in thirty years , henrietta walk down the narrow street with its shuttered shops just stir and its inhabitants eye her with the frankest curiosity . 
she smile and bow , recall the princess-in-a-carriage feeling she had enjoy when she be a child . 
now , some of the acknowledgments be cautious , but all be interested . 
an old_man , sit against the wall of a cottage and wait for the sun to find him , give her a more_than reflective look as she pass , the sap still plainly rise in his branches . 
on an impulse , she turn back and say good_morning . 
he cup his ear and shake his head at her repetition , announce in a nettled way that he had hear her the first time . 
he then offer his own estimate of the weather , which be unenthusiastic . 
`` summer 's be slow to come '' , he say . 
`` it be my dryin_'_out time '' . 
he scowl at her flowers . 
`` i 'm take them to the cemetery '' , say henrietta , out of a vague feeling of hospitality . 
`` they 'll be take ' me next '' , he say pleasantly , `` but not so soon 's they plan . 
see half of ' em in their graves before i choose my own coffin . 
it 's dry_out ' myself out that does_it '' . 
he regard her with rise hope . 
`` you 'd like to hear how i go_about it '' . 
`` it 's nice of you '' , henrietta say doubtfully . 
`` y be welcome '' . 
he straighten himself , soldierly against the wall , and pull his sprawled feet together so they stand side_by_side in their old boots . 
his stick cease to be a thing to rest his chin on and become a pointer for emphasize the finer aspects of his text . 
`` every_month , f ' r three days '' , he say happily , `` i take no water into my system , no water whatsoever . 
it rest the tissues '' . 
henrietta murmur that she could quite see how it would , and he nod approval of her womanly good_sense . 
`` rest the tissues '' , he say , `` and pacify the system . 
my dad did_it , and he live to a great age '' . 
he look up at her sharply . 
`` do n't remember , do you '' ? 
she did suddenly , through the link of memory with his father , old titus , who must have be in his nineties when henrietta run_away . 
next to the blackwells , titus had own the island most , and she and adelia had often stand in front of him , silence by his terrible years - a scanty man with a thin beard and very deep-set blue eyes like a mariner , more aged than possible . 
he had never speak once to the awed sisters , but his son had be friendly , a big fellow of fifty or more , a fishing-boat captain and powerful like the sea . 
it must be that son who sit before her now , shriveled to half his size and half his senses . 
she say gently , `` of_course i remember you '' . 
`` not so well 's i remember you '' , he say . 
`` y be the young blackwell woman . 
run_away on a black night with a lawful wedded man . 
i know all about you '' . 
`` you do seem to '' , say henrietta , impressed . 
`` ca n't blame a man for leave ' his wife '' , he say quite cheerfully . 
`` leave mine many_a time , only she never know it . 
man in a boat , there 's a_lot_of places he can put_in at and a_lot_of reasons he can be away for a_bit . 
any harm in_that '' ? 
`` probably '' , say henrietta dryly . 
he give a short hard laugh and look at her knowingly . 
`` you 'd be the one to say '' , he observe , and she find herself like his approval none too well , but she could not defend herself and say that her actions be `` different '' , since all actions have their own laws . 
only , this old_man 's connivance be even_less to her taste than selma_cotter 's open censure . 
well , she had not come_back to great_island to be understand , praise or condemn . 
she had come to make_peace her peace with the past , and of_that past this ancient of the earth be only a kind_of shadow . 
she start to move away , just_as a woman come_out of the cottage , a big-boned , drab-haired figure with a clean apron tied over her limp print dress . 
she smile vaguely at henrietta and speak_to the old_man . 
`` you 've not have your breakfast yet , gran ' dad '' . 
`` y ' r dam ' porridge be no breakfast '' , he say . 
`` milk and sops '' ! 
he beat the air with his stick , and it fall from his claws and clatter on the stones . 
`` he be owly today '' , his grand-daughter say wearily , and bend to pick_up it up . 
`` he 's get this idea about dry_out '' . 
`` it be n't an idea '' ! 
`` if it be n't an idea '' , she say , `` how comes it you can drink beer but not water '' ? 
he look piously to heaven and say , `` beer do n't affect the tissues none '' , and the ingenious hypocrisy of_this defense please henrietta so_that she forgive him his stint of malevolence . 
his grand-daughter sigh . 
`` come_on , do . 
the children are eat , and miss_blackwell be on her way somewheres '' . 
`` to the graveyard . 
who be n't '' ? 
`` not me . 
i 've get a day 's work to do . 
- you 'll be visit miss_doaty , ma_'_am '' ? 
henrietta nod . 
how much they know about her ! 
the woman ( she must have be a tiny baby when hetty and delia had stand arm in arm , watch great age grow small ) answer the nod with her own . 
`` god rest her soul , she be a sweet one . 
come on now '' . 
she put a strong hand under the old_man 's arm and lift him up , patiently , with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old . 
he mumble at her but let himself be lead off inside the house , shuffle mightily to make it clear how weak and aged he be and_how he was buffet about by those who still have their wicked strength . 
there be a gabble of voices from indoors , young hungry sounds like cats after fish , and a burst of swearing from the old_man . 
henrietta look down at her bouquet , still lively with its color and scent , and set her feet on their journey 's way again , leave the village street and cross the first field , folly dance ahead of her . 
at the edge of the field , the wild rolling land take_over , dotted with fat round bushes like sheep . 
they were cover with tiny white blossoms , their scant roots claw at the stony ground , and wild birds dart in and about and through them so they be nearly alive with the rustle and cry . 
the air be full of sounds too but placid ones , a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out_of_the_blue sky . 
she feel mindless , walk , and almost easy until the church spire tell her she be near the cemetery , and she catch herself wonder what she would say to doaty . 
both church and graveyard be smaller than she remember them ( how many things had lessen while she be gone away ) but the headstones had grow so thick in thirty years that to find one name `` dorothy_tredding '' seem suddenly impossible . 
she sit_down on the nearest , fallen with age and gray with sea-damp , her fingers trace the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss . 
the day 's sun was gather its strength in gold , and she wish she had bring her parasol , if only to shade doaty 's flowers . 
a small , rock-carved angel watch her from a nearby tomb , the only angel in the cemetery . 
she remember , suddenly , a night of savage moonlight and scudding clouds when she and adelia , having dare each other , had steal out of their great safe house and come here , hand_in_hand , hope and fear ghosts . 
the momoyama family had come from miyagi_prefecture , in the northeast of the main japanese island of honshu , where there be still traces of the mysterious ainu strain . 
the ainus be a primitive people , already live on the island before the principal ancestors of the japanese come from southern_asia . 
apparently they be of caucasian blood . 
they have white skins and blue eyes ; all their men be bearded , and many_of their women be beautiful . 
a pitiful few of them be left now , to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient tribal chants , which have the same haunting sadness as the laments of the american_indians . 
most_of them have been assimilate , but sometimes a man in miyagi or akita prefectures be much more hairy than the average japanese , and occasionally a girl will be strikingly lovely , her coloring warm and improve by a_little of the tawny honey-in-the-sun tint of the invaders from the south . 
tommy_momoyama be one of these fortunate occasions . 
she be taller than most japanese girls , and have the exquisitely willowy form of the japanese girl who be lucky enough to be tall . 
her nose be higher of bridge , her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible_to sunburn , and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had give her teeth that be white and regular and strong . 
her mouth , soft and full , be something for any man to dream about . 
she have black_eyes , long and intriguingly tilted , and the way she walk be melody . 
she had be in japan just one week . 
it be an alien land , and she hate it intensely ; she was already consider put_in rebellious requests for duty at san_diego , bremerton , the great_lakes , pensacola - any place the navy have a hospital - with a threat to resign her commission if the request were not grant . 
anywhere would be better than the land of her ancestors . 
there was nothing wrong with her job . 
tommy had been assign to the psychopathic ward . 
there be no depressingly serious cases : the ward doctor sometimes team_up with the chaplain to serve as a marriage counselor - sometimes the navy send people back to the states to preserve a marriage - but mental_health as a rule be very high . 
at_present the doctor 's main concern be in see_to_it that japanese salvage firms were not permit to operate on the hulks of warships sink too_close inshore , because the work involve set_off nerve-shattering blasts at_all hours . 
tommy be interested in psychiatry , because there was much an understanding nurse could do to help the patients . 
but she suffer in her off-duty hours . 
such_as now , when she sit at a table in the coffee_shop at the officers ' club , have coffee and a hamburger to sustain her until dinnertime . 
she had change into a cocktail_dress , and the whole evening should have be before her , but already she was begin to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck . 
this be one of the navy 's crossroads - you find them all_around the world . 
ships from the west_coast rotate on six-month tours_of_duty with the seventh_fleet , and yokosuka be the seventh_fleet 's principal port for maintenance , upkeep and shore liberty . 
sooner_or_later , all the gray navy ships come_in here ; if tommy sit long enough , she would be sure to see all the young officers she had meet in san_diego and long_beach . 
and she want desperately to see someone she had know back there . 
she feel , rather_than see , the approach of the good-looking young_man . 
he come_through from the fleet_bar , which be stag , with the ice_cubes tinkle in a glass he carry . 
when he see tommy sit alone , the tinkling sound stop . 
he be perhaps a_trifle tipsy , having be long at_sea where drinking is not permit , and consequently out_of_practice ; he wear a brown tweed sports_jacket obviously tailor in hong_kong , and he be of an age that mark him as a lieutenant . 
probably off one of the carriers - an aviator . 
there be a fifty-fifty chance , perhaps , that he would be unmarried , and an even more slender chance that his approach would be different . 
japan do something to_a_man - and it be n't just japan , either , because the same thing apply anywhere overseas . 
it be as if foreign duty imply and excuse license ; it intimate that the folks at_home would never know about it , and , therefore , why not ? 
then the young_man in the brown sports_jacket speak , and it be no different . 
`` harro , girl-san '' ! he say , turn_on what was mean to be charm . 
`` you catchee boy-furiendo ? 
maybe you like date with me '' ? 
`` i beg_your_pardon '' ! 
tommy say out of her cold rage . 
`` i do n't believe i know you , and i can n't understand your quaint brand of english - it was mean to be english , was n't it '' ? 
the nice-looking young officer fall_back on his heels , open-mouthed and blushing . 
at_least , he have the decency to blush , she think . 
`` oh - i be sorry ! 
you see , i think - i mean i really have no idea '' - 
`` oh , yes - you have ideas '' ! 
tommy interrupt furiously . 
`` all wrong ones '' ! 
then she jerk her thumb toward the door in a very american gesture , and drop into navy slang . 
`` take_off , fly-boy '' ! 
`` uh - sorry '' ! he mutter , and take_off , obviously feel like a fool . 
the trouble be that there was no lasting satisfaction in_this for tommy . 
she feel like a fool , too . 
it had n't be this way in college , or in nurses ' training ; it be n't this way in the hospital at san_diego . 
everybody had accept her for what she be - a very charming girl . 
nobody had address her in broken english at any of those places , nobody had suggest that she be n't american . 
there are spanish girls who look_like tommy_momoyama , brunettes with a moorish hint of the orient in their faces ; there are beauties from the balkan_states who be similarly endowed , and - back in the blessed united_states - they were regard simply as pretty women . 
now , having been send halfway around the world on a job she had not ask for , tommy was being humiliate at every turn . 
she look_around , self-consciously . 
four little japanese waitresses were murder the_english language at the counter - yuki_kobayashi happen to be one of them . 
everybody but tommy seem to think it be charming when they call , `` bifutek-san '' ! for a steak sandwich , or `` kohi futotsu '' ! for one cup of coffee . 
two other japanese girls were sit at the tables , both quite pretty and well groomed . 
one be with a whitehaired and doting lieutenant_commander ; the other be with her american husband and their exceptionally appealing children . 
see these did_nothing for tommy 's mood . 
she tell herself rebelliously , and with_pride , i be an american ! 
and so she be , and would remain . 
but she was learn that so_long as she be in_this country , and wear civilian_dress in the club , there would always be transient young_men who would approach her with broken english . 
there had be occasions when some of the more experienced had even address her in_what might have be perfectly good japanese . 
tommy would n't know ; after come to america , her parents had speak only english . 
one thing was become increasingly sure . 
she had been send to the wrong place for duty . 
there be more to service in the navy_nurse_corps than the hours in the ward . 
one had_to have friends , and a congenial life in after-duty hours . 
now there be raucous male singing from the fleet_bar . 
it be terribly off key , and poorly do , and tommy could never admit to herself that male companionship be a very natural and important thing , but all_at_once she feel lonesome and put-upon . 
she finish her hamburger and drink her coffee and pay her check ; she get_out of the coffee_shop before the incident could be repeat . 
eating while angry had give her a slight indigestion . 
back in her living_quarters at the hospital she take bicarbonate_of_soda , and sulk . 
then , after a while , she go to her mirror . 
it be all true . 
she certainly look japanese , and perhaps she could not really blame the young_men . 
and , still , they did not have_to be so crude in their approach . 
there was a letter to write to her mother , and she try to make its tone cheerful . 
she promise that she would soon take a_few day 's leave and visit the uncle she had never see , on the island of oyajima - which be not very far from yokusuka . 
and tomorrow she would take time to shop for the kimono her mother want to present to the young wife of a faculty_member as a hostess gown . 
tommy , of_course , had never hear of a kotowaza , or japanese proverb , which say , `` tanin yori miuchi '' , and is literally translate as `` relatives be better than strangers '' . 
actually , this be only another way of say that blood be thicker than water . 
doc_doolittle 's scheduled appearance at captain 's mast be a very unusual thing , because the discipline dispense there be ordinarily for the young and immature , and a chief be naturally expect to stay off the report . 
but the beer hall riot in subic had be unusual , too , and walt_perry be convinced that doc had start it through some expert tactics in rabble rousing . 
just why anybody should wish to start a riot the executive_officer did n't know . 
in his opinion , doc had not grow_up . 
the lieutenant be not entirely wrong in the belief . 
there had never be a good reason for doc_doolittle to grow_up . 
he had come into the navy too young , with the image of the fun-loving guns appleby before him . 
the war find him much too early , and its perils - and especially its awful boredom - were best forget in horseplay and elaborate practical_jokes , and even now doc had never find any stabilizing , sobering influence . 
he remain young at_heart , with an overdeveloped sense_of_humor . 
he wisecrack about the captain 's indoctrination of new men , take great delight in slaughter cockroaches with ethyl chloride , and give no thought for tomorrow . 
he was do thirty years , and the navy would take care of him . 
the job security enjoy by doc_doolittle , and nearly all members of the armed_forces , be a wonderful thing . 
actually , all a man in uniform has_to do be to get_by . 
he may_not rise to the heights , but he can get_by , and eventually be retire . 
doc had be under restriction to the ship since the bustard leave subic . 
this deprive him of liberty in hong_kong , but he tell boats mccafferty that hong_kong be a book he had read before , and the navy would always bring him there again , some_day . 
at yokosuka he was restrict to the confines of the base because walt_perry , be thoughtful , know that doc might have_to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the supply_base . 
this give doc the whole range of the naval establishment , and suit him quite well . 
there were two things he want to do : inspect one of the many caves that had been dig into the hills on the naval_base , and visit an old shipmate . 
a telephone_line had been hook_up to connect the ship with the base exchange . 
after supper , doc call whitey_gresham , who be now a lieutenant and have a family . 
`` well , doc , you old sonofabitch '' ! 
whitey exclaim , with true affection . 
`` come over and have a drink . 
we live down by the base commissary . 
grab a taxi '' . 
`` i 'll be there , but i 'll walk '' , doc say . 
`` i 've got_to run an errand on_the_way . 
see you in about an hour '' . 
he throw a smart salute at the gangway , go up the dock , and turn down the wide street in_front of the petty_officers ' club . 
how , he wonder , does one enjoy one 's spare_time ? 
he consider some interesting excursion but he be on the road every_day from dawn to dusk . 
then there was exercise , boating and hiking , which be not_only good_for_you but also make you more virile : the thought of strenuous activity leave him exhausted . 
perhaps golf , with a fashionable companion - but he 'd lose his clubs , had n't play in years . 
there was swimming over at the riverside_hotel , but his skin be so white he look_like the bottom of a frog . 
perhaps a packing trip into the sierras , let his beard grow - but that be too stark . 
i could , he think , take a long walk - but where ? 
the telephone ring . 
`` you miss it '' , buzz 's voice say , `` you should have go over to the pagan_room with us . 
wow . 
strippers , but scrumptious , and toodle_williams and her all-lesbian band '' . 
`` hi , buzz '' , owen say . 
`` i go over to the willows and dropped two notes '' . 
`` tough '' , buzz say , `` listen , we 're have a stag dinner over at the pagan_room on friday . 
imagine a stag dinner with toodle_williams '' . 
he laugh and laugh . 
owen want to be pleasant because buzz work the territory next to his , but he had n't come to reno for stag dinners . 
`` thanks '' , owen say , `` but friday be a long way off and anything can happen '' . 
buzz be a tireless instigator who never let his victims rest . 
when owen be finally rid of him , there be a timid rap at the door . 
`` yes '' , owen call_out . 
`` yes '' ? 
`` i be mrs._gertrude_parker '' , a soft voice explain , `` and i 'd like to talk to you for a_few minutes , please '' . 
ahah , he think , a lush divorcee at_last . 
probably see me in the lobby . 
he be disappointed to find a nervous , scrawny woman with a big hat stand at the door . 
she frown at his green pajamas with the yellow moons . 
`` how_do_you_do '' ? she say , semi-professionally . 
`` our church is sponsor a group of very courageous women up in alaska . 
we call them lay-sisters and they go among the eskimos make friends and bring the light . 
they be up there in_that freezing climate and all_of us have to try and help them '' . 
`` oh '' ? 
`` you see '' , she say , look past him into the room , where the highball glasses sparkle dully in the bright light , `` you and i can n't understand the many hardships they have to undergo '' . 
`` why is that '' ? 
she apparently be n't satisfied with his reaction . 
smug , owen think , smug and sappy . 
there be a slight nervous twitch in the region of her left eye . 
it give her a lewd , winking effect . 
`` have you ever try to reason with an eskimo '' ? 
she ask , wink wildly . 
`` they be a very difficult group of people '' . 
`` i do n't know much about them '' , owen admit , `` but i suppose they have their own religion and they probably resent outsiders come_in and tell them what to do and what not to do '' . 
she smile in a sickly-tolerant fashion . 
`` you know , that be very interesting . 
people do n't know how much they give_away about themselves by remarks like that . 
the more canvassing i do , the more i note how far most people be from their personal god '' . 
forebear , owen keep his peace . 
what would happen next ? 
that she be out for a touch be certain , but when did she get_to the pitch ? 
several people pass in the hall and stare as he slowly retreat , try to close the door a_little , and she slowly lean toward him and raise her voice . 
`` how did you get_by the desk '' ? he ask curiously . 
`` i be sure the hotel does n't know you 're wander around the corridors , knock on strangers ' doors and talk_down eskimos '' . 
`` oh , i just come once a week . 
every_day i visit a different hotel . 
i feel it be my duty . 
i do this work all on my own , because i understand the difficulties and i want to help these lay-sisters . 
do you know these women go all through alaska , and they do n't have the proper facilities ? 
they travel in pairs as much_as a hundred-and-fifty miles a day '' . 
`` do you have any idea how far i travel every_day ? 
i have the whole pacific_northwest '' . 
owen be aware he was get overexcited but he could n't help himself . 
mrs. gertrude parker draw_back . 
`` that be hardly_a christian approach '' , she remonstrate . 
`` you be in the secular world '' . 
`` i did n't say it be christian . 
i do n't think you 'll find many active christian salesmen . 
not that religion be n't big business ; those bibles and prayer_books make a_lot_of money for publishing_houses , but they do n't get top personnel . 
our key salesmen be in appliances and cosmetics '' . 
`` god , i take it , play no part in_this '' , she say waspishly . 
`` god does n't have any appliance or cosmetics '' , he say heatedly before he catch himself . 
it sound silly ; why go_on ? 
more people were pass ; he had_to find some way to close this impossible conversation . 
`` and whiskey '' , she say , smile and blink at the highball glasses . 
`` do n't forget whiskey ; it be such a big seller '' . 
`` you know '' , he say , get a grip on himself , `` i think you 're going_to have to excuse me . 
i have an appointment '' . 
`` i can imagine '' , she say . 
`` probably down at the bar . 
but what do you want to do about the lay-sisters ? 
they must be freeze up there now . 
ca n't you help them '' ? 
`` leave a card or something . 
i 'll think it over '' . 
`` i have no card '' , she say bitterly . 
`` you have n't been listen to what i 've been tell you . 
i only hope my talk to you has help you a_little , anyway , because you need spiritual buck_up '' . 
she look crestfallen , as if he had somehow disappoint the whole human_race . 
she stand indecisively for a moment , then walk down the hall ; he hear her knock on another door . 
it take him about fifteen minutes to calm himself ; then he realize he be hungry . 
he shower , shave , dress and go_down to the dining_room for breakfast . 
on_the_way he stop at the desk to receive his mail . 
there be a check from his company , and the usual enthusiastic bulletins on new_lines they always issue . 
his lawyer had send him a statement on his overdue alimony , and there be a letter from the collector_of_internal_revenue ask him to stop in his office and explain last year 's exemptions . 
he eat breakfast in a sullen mood , but afterwards , when he walk out onto virginia_street , he feel braced . 
he look off to the crest of the sierras , still white-topped ; the glisten of the truckee_river make a wide spangle . 
he feel suddenly elated , adventurous . 
with any luck at_all he could easily find a flowerpot . 
although it be only three o ' clock , he stop in at the golden_calf . 
the tables were all spin , the dice rattle , the bar crowded . 
just to test himself , he play roulette for quarters on his old combination , five and seventeen , and within an hour , he had win , surprisingly , twenty dollars . 
the way was open_up ; when the management bring around champagne , the breakfast settle its whirling_around in his stomach . 
the golden_calf be dimly lit with shaded neon . 
there be more women than men in the place , but he could n't find a flowerpot . 
they all have the hard look of gamblers who had stop dream , who automatically turn the cards , hardly care what show_up . 
the mural around the wall depict early settlers in covered_wagons , who appear much more animated than the gamblers . 
the women have a bright shining expectancy as they lean out from the wall and gaze splendidly into the distance , while the men be stern but hopeful . 
all , of_course , except the donner party who be bent_on starve to death . 
`` i wonder if they did eat each other at the end '' , owen muse . 
he sit_down next to a heavily-upholstered blonde , but she was clean_out in twenty minutes . 
she sigh a dirty word and leave . 
owen be surprised to see mrs._gertrude_parker play the one-arm bandits that were cunningly arrange by the entrance . 
she sit_down and play two slots at_once , look grim , as if best by mechanical_devices , and owen feel sorry_for the lay-sisters depend_on her support . 
a dried-up cowboy sit_down next to him in the blonde 's place . 
he be a_little more authentic than usual because he smell slightly of the stables . 
`` what you need be a steady martingale '' , the cowboy announce after watch owen play . 
`` you can n't build_on your hit-and-miss five-seventeen '' . 
`` what are you play '' ? 
owen ask . 
`` i 'm just log '' , the cowboy explain . 
`` i keep all these plays in_this little black_book , and i watch over a twelve-hour period to find_out what numbers are repeat . 
but roulette be not my game . 
i 'm always try to find a breaking table in blackjack . 
incidentally , i be pretty famous in these parts : i 'm call the wrangler '' . 
`` nice to know you . 
do n't you have to spend any time on your ranch '' ? 
`` well , of_course i do . 
i be with the bar - h , push a horse called sparky . 
he be my own horse , and what i collect from him i use on blackjack . 
this sparky can rack and single-foot and he be the fastest thing in washoe_county . 
i figure if i can get_going any kind_of publicity campaign going , i 'll land him on tv - you know , one of those favorite horses for some western hero . 
i once train a horse for hoot_gibson , but nothing like sparky . 
he be a pinto and he photograph wonderfully '' . 
five come_up while owen was listen to the wrangler and he neglect to play , a loss of ten dollars . 
this prove conclusively that the wrangler be a jinx , so he walk on down to hurrays , an even more glorified gambling_den than the golden_calf . 
when he look in_the_back , mrs._gertrude_parker was mark keno cards . 
his adventurous spirit had wane ; he study the pistol exhibition that hurrays feature as an added attraction . 
he ogle a long redhead with green eyes , but she be a shill with her money in_front of her . 
he have no great prejudice against shills ; it just seem such a dry_run . 
there be no cash around ; everyone was flip silver_dollars . 
the management discreetly withdraw the green stuff into the office and give the customers chips or checks or premium points . 
he read a special announcement whereby hurrays would feature a special floorshow at three a. m. star adele ( the body ) brenner and fourteen glamorous schoolgirls . 
he wonder if he might bag a tourist , but they look frightened of him . 
he pass two brides , both wear orchids , and they make him feel a_little sad . 
owen find buzz watch chuck-a-luck . 
buzz have_on a hawaiian shirt and was carry some sun-tan oil and dark_glasses . 
he be shorter and fatter than owen , who feel good stand next to him . 
`` we 're all go over to lake_tahoe and try our luck at cal-neva '' , buzz explain , still instigate . 
`` we ran_into a guy at the pagan_room who guarantee we can beat the wheel . 
he start_out as a stickman , then become a pit boss until the club find him crossroading . 
he was knocking_down checks at faro '' . 
`` i be allergic to tahoe '' , owen explain . 
`` something about the pollen '' . 
`` well , okay '' , buzz say . 
`` we 'll see you around later '' . 
owen go over to the crap table and the dice be hot , but he could n't pyramid with any consecutive success . 
`` how 's your luck , honey '' ? 
a short platinum blonde in a bursting sun-suit address him . 
she look well-fed and prosperous , but he did n't get the impression he was being proposition the way he 'd been hope . 
`` i have n't have any luck since i be a baby '' . 
`` stake me '' , she say , `` and let me at those dice . 
i 'll make them dance the tango . 
we 'll get_it in a hurry and get_it out '' . 
`` let 's have a drink and discuss a merger '' . 
`` if you go broke '' , she say , smile up at him , `` i 'll leave you '' . 
`` sound like real love '' , owen say . 
`` it sort_of bring a lump to my throat '' . 
`` my name 's gisele '' , the blonde say after she order a scotch . 
`` name after the ballet . 
my mother want to call me sylphide , but it sound too affected '' . 
rachel steer me along toward a school for young boys begin to study the torah . 
bits of trash lie in the roadway . 
the air smell warmish and foul . 
a young man appear out of a side alley and walk toward us with quick strides . 
he wear a long double-breasted coat of a heavy material , dark trousers , and black boots with buckles . 
his black hat with its wide brim , high crown , and fur trim ride high . 
with his head erect , he approach , not glance at us , and pass_by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead . 
he have a pinkish-white complexion , a small straight nose , a short black beard , and tightly curled paot . 
i be suddenly conscious of my bare arms . 
the girls in the market place wear long-sleeved dresses and cover their legs with cloth stockings . 
i turn and watch him stride down the center of the road . 
his hands were swing at his sides , and he pass_through the dingy market place with his back straight and , pivot on his heel , he enter an old stone building . 
rachel had see me watch the young man . 
she smile . 
`` when your mother be here he must have be a young boy . 
like the ones you will see now '' . 
i swallow hard and look down at my feet plod along beside rachel . 
she lead me into a twisting side alley . 
the dirty , discolored buildings look boarded_up , and their few windows stand high above our heads . 
rachel say that schools and synagogues occupy most_of the buildings . 
we enter one where the front_door stand ajar and climb a flight of steep steps to the main floor . 
an old_man with a white beard and dressed in a long shabby coat , baggy trousers , and a black skullcap greet us . 
rachel talk to him . 
he nod , clasp and unclasp his hands over his paunch , and flick glances at me . 
i think he would ask us to leave because rachel and i be bare-armed , but he look down into his beard and precede us down the corridor . 
his toes point out toward the walls . 
he stop in_front of a door , place a finger on his lips , and , still peer down into his beard , push open the door to a classroom . 
we step inside . 
he leave us . 
little boys crowd_together on long wooden benches , and in_the_center of the room sit the teacher . 
his black beard drip down over the front of his coat . 
one white hand poise a stick above his desk . 
he turn his surly , half-closed eyes toward us , stare for a second , then shout in yiddish , `` one , two , three '' ! 
rap the stick against the desk . 
the little boys shrill out a yiddish translation or interpretation of the five books of moses , which they had previously chant in hebrew . 
they chant a fixed tune in time to the report of the stick . 
each boy open his small mouth wide and rock back_and_forth on the bench in the way his grandfather and great-grandfather had study and pray in the ghettos of europe . 
the boys be tiny . 
they have large bright eyes , the small upturned noses of all babies everywhere , and hair cropped short except for the long ringlets of paot frame their little white faces . 
they bend over yellowed prayerbooks and look up only to watch the teacher . 
since they did not glance curiously at us once , i guess that there was a penalty for distraction . 
the guttural language from the ghetto stop . 
the teacher plunge the children into a new portion , this time in hebrew , rap the stick incessantly . 
one boy who rock back_and_forth over his worn book have bright red hair and freckles . 
his tightly curled paot hang down to his narrow shoulders . 
in_the_center of his brilliant curls sit a small black skullcap . 
his head barely rise above the table . 
i stare at him for a long_time . 
he did not return my interest . 
my eyes travel over the bare walls and up_to the one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the boys . 
some of them ignore the texts and had apparently memorize the words long_ago . 
they singsong the portion at the teacher , who accompany them in an off-key baritone and spur them on with the stick . 
the tapping define the rhythm and keep the boys awake . 
i could not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair . 
his body pitch back_and_forth on the bench . 
his front_teeth be missing . 
i shudder and back_out of the room . 
rachel follow , look at me , and cluck with her tongue . 
we walk down the cool hall silently . 
from behind us come the rapping of the stick and the high-pitched voices of the boys who would grow to devote their lives to rigid study and prayer . 
i say , `` how long do they keep that up '' ? 
`` all day '' , she say . 
`` except for shabbat , when they are pray all day '' . 
i rub my hands together . 
they had turn numb and prickly in the classroom . 
the old_man in the baggy clothes wait at the foot of the steps . 
he glance down into his beard and mutter something in yiddish . 
rachel say , `` he ask for money '' . 
she pass_by him . 
i reach_into the pocket of my skirt , finger ten pruta , and drop the coin . 
then i pick_up it up again and hand it to the old_man . 
he thank me . 
i did n't look at him . 
i grin at rachel . 
`` does this bother you '' ? 
i say . 
she smile to herself . 
`` most_of our sabras think it be horrible . 
when we were fight , a_few of our orthodox people were lie down in the roads so we could not pass . 
they say that we must_not fight but wait for the messiah '' . 
i be amazed . 
you have to have convictions to lie_down in the road in_all those clothes and appear as though you might wish to turn_out yourself out of your own home . 
you have to be stupid or crazy or immortal . 
and i be n't . 
i be american . 
you have to know , also , that you were going_to fail . 
all_of it might have be heroic , but they had do it in the wrong place . 
i resent them . 
rachel face me . 
her bright eyes were twinkle . 
she say , `` sometimes i think they are keep religion for us while we play around . 
your mother hate this way_of_life . 
she wish to change much for the children here '' . 
i say quietly , respectfully , `` what did she do here ? 
in_this section '' ? 
rachel click her tongue behind her teeth . 
`` here , nothing . 
but when she see the children you have just visit , she want to take_away them away and put them out in the country , in the kibbutzim . 
she love the children . 
she be a strange woman , your mother . 
when she love , it was with a passion that drive her along and carry along with her those things she love . 
nothing be too impossible for her to do when she want . 
she stay here to work for aliah . 
for many immigrants , for many children , the first thing they know of israel and freedom be your mother . 
sometimes it be dangerous for her '' . 
rachel grin slyly . 
`` but she love danger . 
she take it with her wherever she go ; she choose it . 
and i think she seek_out danger as much_as she seek_out help other people . 
she be most strange woman . 
ready_to follow her impulse . 
it be an impulse when she be here in me ' a she ' arim - i be with her - that lead her to stay in israel . 
your mother want to bring children to israel so_that they could leave their ghettos . 
here they did not need to be in ghettos . 
if she could not take_out the children out of_this section , at_least she could take_out other children out of their countries and put them on the farms . 
she set_out to make_sure that no jewish child anyplace in the world have to live in a place such_as this '' . 
i say quietly , gain nerve , ready to ask any question at_all , no_matter_how intimate , ready_to be rebuff , `` then why did she leave israel ? 
i 'd like to know that very_much '' . 
rachel clasp her hands together and slow her pace . 
the soles of her sandals report sharply on the cobblestones . 
she purse her lips , then clamp them together so tightly that i think she be angry with me . 
but she sigh and her face relax . 
`` trouble come into her life . 
she have good friends here , people who like her . 
who love her . 
but she have to go_out and hurt herself . 
there be a man here in town . 
he help her meet people so she could go_out and do the work she want . 
she work very hard . 
there was a refugee who be able to come here because of her . 
he come with his son . 
at_first i think they be relatives of your mother , but it be not so . 
this refugee be a middle-aged man , a big , handsome man with a strut to his walk as i have never before see . 
he have the black numerals on his arm , so he had been brand in a concentration_camp . 
yet he walk like a young man . 
often he be terribly despondent and talk to no one . 
then he would walk off for a_few days alone in the direction of europe . 
all his family be dead , except for his son . 
your mother would always retrieve him when he wander off , and she would send him home to his son . 
he love the son and be always glad to be send back to him . 
then his son do something '' - rachel throw up her hands - `` i do n't know what , but something , to an official here - it be during the mandate - and the son was imprison . 
a_few hours after the son was arrest , your mother was inform . 
she run from a_little group of us . 
we were sit together , talk . 
she go to the father and find he had hang himself '' . 
rachel pause . 
it be silent in the stone alley . 
then she continue with energy , `` i myself did not see her until a week after she had run_off to find the father . 
no one see her except the man reuveni '' . 
`` yes '' , i say . 
`` i know him '' . 
rachel give me a direct , bright-eyed look . 
she say , `` reuveni want your mother to give_up her deep interest in_this refugee . 
he say she would only hurt herself . 
he complain to me once that i must talk to her . 
when i did , she shrug her shoulders and say that reuveni want her to marry him . 
i ask her if she would , and she say she would not . 
he had know when he first help her to meet the right people and work with them that she did not intend to marry him . 
anyway , i did not see her until two_weeks after the refugee hang himself . 
she come to me one_day . 
she be pale and skinny ; she be terribly alone . 
and she say that after this man had be dead for a week she had go to reuveni and accept his proposal . 
he shout at her and tell her he love her and could n't understand why she had upset herself . 
but now he be happy she would let him straighten_out her life and take care of her . 
he would never let her harm herself again . 
for one whole week he never let her stay alone . 
she let him lead her around . 
he take her to a doctor , for she be run_down , nervous , did not care where she be . 
reuveni take her with him wherever he go . 
he did not let her talk to people ; he did not let her choose her own food . 
she be limp and beaten from her loss ; she did not care . 
it was among these that hinkle identify a photograph of barco ! 
for it seem that barco , fancy himself a ladies ' man ( and why not , after seven marriages ? ) 
, had list himself for mormon_beard roles at the instigation of his fourth murder victim who had say : `` with your beard , dear , you ought to be in movies '' ! 
mills secure barco 's photograph from the gentleman in charge , rush to the hollywood police_station to report the theft , and less_than five minutes later , detectives with his picture in_hand be on the trail of cal_barco . 
on their way , they stop at every gas_station along the main boulevards to question the attendants . 
finally , at ye_olde_gasse filling_station on avocado_avenue , they learn that their man , having pause to get oil for his car , had ask about the route to san_diego . 
they head in_that direction and , at san_juan capistrano_by-the-sea come_upon barco sit in the quaint old spanish mission_drive-in , eat a hot tamale . 
at the moment , barco 's back be to the road so he did n't see the detectives close_in on his convertible which , in their quest for the stolen lap rug , they proceed to search . 
the robe , however , be missing , for by that time barco had dispose of it at a pawnshop in glendale . 
the detectives place barco under arrest and , without inform him of the nature of the charge , take_back him back to hollywood for questioning . 
thus it was that barco , apprehend for mere larceny , now begin to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncover . 
during the return trip , barco keep mutter to himself in meaningless phrases , such_as : 
`` they be under sand_dunes . 
they be better off , i tell you . 
i save their souls '' . 
the detective , comment on barco 's behavior , feel that he merely belong among the myriad citizens of our community who be mentally unhinged - that he be a more_or_less harmless `` nut '' ! 
however while in his cell await trial for theft , barco , in a fit of apprehension , make an attempt to take his own life . 
the attempt had fail because , when endeavor to cut his wrists , this murderer of seven women had faint at the sight of blood . 
the jail authorities - attach no particular significance to the episode - offer barco whisky to revive him ; but the old fellow , a lifelong teetotaler , refuse it , and no_more was think_of the_matter . 
then it was that district_attorney welch enter the case . 
a man of vaulting ambition , with one eye on the mayorship of los_angeles , nothing ever escape him which might possibly lead to personal publicity . 
it was report to welch 's office that a thief in the city jail had attempt suicide . 
welch want to know why . 
no one know . 
now welch have a pet theory that everyone be guilty of break more laws than he ever gets catch at . 
the suicide attempt look to him like an opportunity to put his theory to the test . 
so he pay a call on barco in his cell and begin their chat by state bluntly : 
`` barco , we 've get the goods on you ! 
it 'll be a_lot better if you come_clean '' . 
at_first barco be evasive and shifty . 
but with welch 's relentless pursuit of the subject , barco finally `` break '' and start confess to one murder after another . 
by the time barco reach the count of three , the situation seem to welch almost too good to be true . 
but if true , it be the case of_which he had dream , the case which would throw him into headlines all_over america as the hero of a great murder trial . 
welch summon jail officials to barco 's cell . 
but to welch 's chagrin , the police_captain pooh-pooh welch 's credulity in barco 's confession . 
barco be clearly a `` nut '' . 
it require strength , bravado , daring to commit murder . 
`` that worm a murderer ? 
ridiculous '' ! 
then , for_the_first_time since his arrest , a glint of spirit light barco 's eyes . 
his manhood had been attack . 
he stiffen and rise to his feet . 
he 'd show them ! 
`` is that so '' ? he query . 
`` well , for ten years i 've been murder women . 
i can lead you to every one of the bodies , and there ai n't four , nor five , nor six of ' em - there 's seven ! '' 
the next day the police_captain , in derision , organize what he term `` welch 's wild_goose_chase '' . 
for indeed it seem incredible that anyone could go_on commit murder for ten years and not get catch at it , even in hollywood . 
the searching party consist_of the police_captain , welch , barco , policemen with shovels , newspaper reporters , and cameramen . 
barco , his state of apprehension go , never to return , had assume a matter-of-factness which remain his principal attitude from_that_time_on . 
he direct the cortege of autos to the sand_dunes near santa_monica . 
stop the cars at a fork in the road , he get_out , pace off a certain distance to a spot between two shrub-covered sand hills , and indicate a location . 
orders were give to dig . 
nothing was find . 
welch be worried . 
the police_captain chortle . 
the newspaper boys cracked jokes and again barco 's pride was arouse . 
with greater precision he again pace off a location , this time a_little more to the left . 
with quibs and gibes , the policemen again start dig . 
welch be on edge . 
the captain was remark that it be a nice day for a picnic when finally one of the shovels strike an object . 
`` there be something here '' ! say the digger . 
joking stop and everyone gather around . 
the digger , thrust about with his shovel , now raise into view a package crudely wrapped in one of the murderer 's hollywood sport_shirts . 
although it be a mere fragment of the victim 's remains , it be enough . 
welch be wild with delight . 
his elation grow as barco 's seven disclosures bring to light one reward after another . 
now did welch truly become the man of the hour , and everything that follow in the procedure of justice be a new triumph for him . 
it go_to his head , and his ambition increase . 
it be apparent that welch be in cahoots with marshall and would use his power as d._a. to drag every possible sensation into the case . 
every new scandal which would provide more `` copy '' for marshall 's pen would thus mean more publicity for welch . 
i know that both these cynics were wait with_impatience for the dramatic moment when viola was call to the stand . 
once there , the d._a. with devilish cleverness would provide marshall with headlines : `` viola 's multiple_romances '' , `` viola_lake an addict '' , `` downfall of another film_idol '' ! 
it would be fine publicity for the man who be willing to walk to the mayor 's throne over the broken reputation of a helpless girl ! 
i study welch closely as the trial progress for any hint which might give me a lead as to how he might be thwart . 
it was n't long before i sense that there was something deeper than overvaulting ambition back of his desire for viola 's destruction . 
he be bitter and resentful toward her , personally resentful . 
a dreadful fear enter my consciousness that perhaps he had entertain aspirations toward viola 's favors - or , even more serious perhaps , that he had attain a share of them and had then been supersede by some luckier chap . 
i did not rest until i had track the mystery down . 
well , here it is . 
one_day over a year before , there had be a cocktail_party in an apartment of a downtown hotel . 
viola had been urge to attend , by telephone , and not know the host or the character of the party , she had go . 
she arrive late and as she enter the party , note that gentlemen seem to be in the majority ; the air be thick_with smoke , empty bottles be in_evidence , and several of the guests be somewhat the worse for liquor . 
naturally , viola have no wish to remain , but she feel she could n't leave so soon after her arrival , in_all politeness to her host . 
and it so happen that adjacent to a couch on_which she had take refuge be a small table on_which she note a vase of red rosebuds ; while project from beneath the couch be a pair of feet which , as fate would have it , belong_to district_attorney welch . 
as viola sit there , a playful impulse overcome her to remove the shoes and socks from the unidentified feet and , as a prank , insert rosebuds between the toes . 
a_little later the district_attorney wake_up , emerge from under the couch , look at his watch , and realize he have an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the culture_forum on `` the civic_spirit of the southland '' , in the byzantine room of the hotel where his wife , as president of the forum , was to preside . 
he make_one's_way to his host 's bedroom where he carefully brush himself off , neatly arrange his hair , and painstakingly select his hat from the many on the bed . 
then , note neither the absence of his footwear nor the presence of the rosebuds , he make_one's_way to the byzantine room and , with his usual dignity , mount the rostrum . 
the effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagine . 
the incident , aside from reflect on welch 's political career , had all_but wreck his home life . 
he never rest until he discover who the culprit be , and when he did , he vow vengeance on viola_lake if ever the chance come his way . 
and here it be ! 
by such innocent actions are human tragedies sometimes set_in_motion . 
during these first days of the trial i did n't have as much time to commiserate with viola as i should have like . 
in_the_first_place , it be difficult for us to meet . 
we could n't be see together , for the tongue of scandal be ever ready_to link our names , and the tongue of scandal find but one thing to say of the association of a man with a girl , no_matter_how innocent . 
i could n't invite viola to our house , for mother snobbishly refuse to receive her . 
now the czarship had not affect my own sense of social values , but mother had attain a reflected glory through it , which had open the doors of los_angeles-pasadena_society to her . 
there , mother was receive by the scions of aristocratic lines which are dominate by the budweisers ( of beer derivation ) , the chalmers ( of underwear origin ) , and the heinzes ( whose forbears found a nationally famous trade in pickles ) . 
i hate being drag into the salons of these aristocrats . 
but mother insist , for it is seldom indeed that anyone remotely connected with the cinema is ever receive in their exclusive midsts . 
in_fact , it was not until the king of spain had visit at pickfair that mary and doug were beckon to cross the sacred barriers which separate los_angeles and pasadena from the hoi-polloi . 
mother even go so_far as to trump_up for me matrimonial opportunities with pasadena debs who had been educate abroad , and with those of the more lenient los_angeles area where a debutante be a girl who had be to high_school . 
but at_long_last come a time when i break_away from mother and her society `` chi-chi '' in_order_to spend a cosy evening with viola and her chaperon at her home . 
however , such a hotbed of gossip had grow up during the trial , that every precaution have to be take to keep my visit from being whisper to the world , society , and even , alas , to my own mother . 
when i arrive_at viola 's i was show , to my surprise , into the kitchen . 
viola greet me , in checked apron , ladle in_hand , and explain it be the cook 's night out and that she herself was prepare dinner . 
i sit and watch proceedings . 
there was to be roast chicken with dressing , giblet gravy , asparagus , new peas with a sprig of mint , creamed onions , and mashed potatoes - all choose , prepare , and cook by viola herself . 
i realize that hamlet was face with an entirely different problem , but his agony could have be no greater . 
the_most that was accomplish was add mrs._beige 's tray to the dish pile , and by means of repeated threats , on an ascending scale , see that the girls dress themselves , after_a_fashion . 
i was save from make the decision as the phone ring , and the girls be upon me instantly . 
here 's a household hint : if you can n't find your children , and get tired of call them , pick_up the phone . 
no_matter if your children be at the movies , in school , visit their grandmother , or on a field trip in some distant city , they will be upon you magically within seconds after you pick_up the phone . 
jennie and miranda twine themselves around me , murmur endearments . 
louise climb onto a stool and clutch the hand with which i was try to hold the phone , claim my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency . 
somehow manage to get_out a cool , poised , `` wo n't you hold_on a second , please '' , i cover up the mouthpiece , and with more warmth and less poise , give a quick lecture on crime and punishment , mostly the latter , include devil 's island and the remoter reaches of siberia . 
i promise to illustrate the lecture , if they so_much as breathe till after the call be completed . 
speak into the phone again and recognize the caller , i resume my everyday voice . 
soon we be deep in a conversation that was interrupt many_times by little things like jennie 's hold her breath and pretend to black_out , miranda 's dump the contents of the sugar_bowl on the table , and various screeches , thuds , and giggles . 
under_the_circumstances , i have difficulty keep_up with the conversation on the phone , but when i hang_up i be reasonably certain that francesca had want to remind me of our town_meeting the next evening , and_how important it be that hank and i be there . 
i discover that the girls had shrewdly vacate the kitchen , and were play quietly in the living_room . 
it seem that i would be the gainer if i accept the peace and quiet , instead of carry_out my threats . 
resolve to get something done , i started in on the dishes . 
no . 
i 'm not say it right . 
what i mean to say be that i start to start in on the dishes by gather them all_together in the kitchen_sink . 
they look so formidable , however , so demanding , that i find myself stare at them in dismay and start to woolgather again , this time about francesca and her husband . 
how about them , i think . 
francesca and herbert be among the few people we know in catatonia . 
we did n't even know them till about a month after we move - at_that_time , they had call on us , after i meet fran at a pta meeting , and had take us in_hand socially . 
they had be kind to us and we be indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinners , and for information as to where to shop , which dentist , doctor , plumber , and sitter to call ( not that there be much of a choice , since catatonia be just a village ; the yellow_pages of the telephone_book be amazingly thin ) . 
they be `` personalities '' . 
herb , an expert on narrow ties , thin lapels , and swatches , be men 's fashion editor of parvenu , the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation . 
fran and he had meet about two years after she had arrive in manhattan from nebraska , or be it wyoming ? 
she be the daughter and sole heiress of either a cattle baron or an oil millionaire and , having arrive in new_york with a big bank roll , become a dabbler in various fields . 
she patronize greenwich_village artists for awhile , then put some money into a broadway show which be successful ( terrible , but successful ) . 
it be during her `` writing '' period that she and herb meet and decide that they be in_love . 
they were marry at a lavish ceremony which was duly record in parvenu and all other magazines and newspapers , and_then they honeymoon in bermuda . 
no , not bermuda . 
bermuda be not in_style that year . 
they had honeymoon in rome ; everyone be very high on rome that year . 
they had buy their house in catatonia after investigate all the regions of suburbia surrounding new_york ; they had choose catatonia because of its reputation for excellent schools , beaches , and abundance of names . 
`` you be bound_to get involved with people when you have children '' , fran had tell me at our first meeting , `` so it be good to know that those with whom you get involved be not just dreary little housewives and dull husbands , but people who do things '' . 
i admire their easy way of do things but i could n't escape an uneasiness at their way of always do the right things . 
their house be a centuries-old colonial which they had have restore ( guide by an eminent architect ) and update , and add_on to . 
it have a gourmet 's corner ( instead of a kitchen ) , a breakfast room , a luncheon room , a dining_room , a sitting_room , a room for stand_up , a party room , dressing_rooms for everybody , even a room for mud . 
it was all set_up so there would be no dust anywhere and so_that their children would color in the coloring room , paint in the painting room , play with blocks in the block house , and do all the other things in the proper rooms at exactly the right time . 
their two boys be `` well adjusted '' and , like their parents , always do the right thing at the right time and damn the consequences . 
francesca and herbert consider themselves violently nonconformist and show the world they were by fill their colonial house with contemporary furniture and paintings and other art objects ( expensive , but not necessarily valuable , contemporary things ) . 
fran flaunt her independence by rebel against the catatonia uniform of bermuda_shorts and knee-length socks by wear bermuda_shorts and knee-length socks in color ; bright pinks and plaids and vivid stripes . 
sometimes she even wear the uniform in solid , unrelieved black , and with her blonde hair cut so closely , wear this uniform , she strongly resemble a member of the ss. . 
no one could dislike them , i think . 
sometimes , though , they did not seem quite human . 
it seem , indeed , that their house be not so_much a home , but rather a perfect stage_set , and that they be actors who had been hand fat roles in a successful play , and have talent enough to fill the roles competently , with nice understatement . 
practically the only enthusiasm they show be when they were discuss `` names '' ; even brand names . 
you should hear the reverence in fran 's voice when she say `` baccarat '' or `` steuben '' or `` madame_alexander '' . 
she always let it be know that there be wine in the pot_roast or that the chicken had been marinate in brandy , and that koussevitzky 's second_cousin be an intimate of theirs . 
i would n't have waste time puzzle_over this couple were it not for my fear that all the other inhabitants of catatonia be equally unreal . 
i could n't feel at_home among them . 
besides francesca , there was blanche . 
francesca be pleasant and charming , but blanche be sweet . 
yes , blanche be very , very sweet - be in her company be like being drown in warm , melted marshmallows . 
i had once be a witness when blanche had smile and say with only minimum ruefulness , `` oh , my souffle has collapse '' . 
anyone know how a real , red-blooded woman would react to such a catastrophe ! 
if blanche had be honest , she would have yell , slam at_least a_couple_of doors , and throw a_few little , valueless things . 
but dear me , no ; not blanche . 
after five minutes with blanche , one might welcome the astringency of grazie , who be a sort_of gwen_cafritz to francesca 's perle_mesta . 
francesca and grazie be habitual committee chairmen and they usually manage to be elect co-chairmen , equal bosses , of whatever pta or civic project was being launch . 
they be inseparable , not because they be fond of each other , but because they want to keep_an_eye_on each other , as they be keen rivals for social leadership . 
grazie be mean : quietly mean , and bitterly , unfunnily sarcastic . 
she it be who had look to see if i was wear shoes upon learn that i could n't drive . 
grazie have a small , slick head and her hair and skin be the color of golden toast . 
she live in an ultra-modern house whose decoration , appointments , paint , and even pets were choose to complement her coloring ; the pets be a_couple_of siamese_cats . 
her uniform be of rich , raw silk , in a shade which match her hair , skin , housepaint , and cats , and since she be so thin as to be almost shapeless , she rather resemble a frozen fish_stick . 
the husbands of these women and_others i had meet in catatonia be distinguished only in_that they be , to me at_least , indistinguishable . 
i could n't tell one from the other . 
like herbert , they be all_in communications : radio , television , magazines , and advertising . 
one or two be writers of books ; all be fellows of finite charm . 
each had develop a hair-trigger chuckle and the habit of say `` zounds '' ! in deference to country-squirehood . 
i never think i 'd live to hear people chuckle and say `` zounds '' ! in real_life . 
i would n't have miss it for_anything . 
they be `` sincere '' - men of the too-hearty handclasp and the urgent smile . 
these boys acknowledge an introduction to anybody by gently press one of his hands in both of theirs , while they gaze , misty-eyed with care , into the eyes of the person they were meet . 
could such unadulterated love , for a total stranger , be credit ? 
they were always leap to light cigarettes , open car_doors , fill plates or glasses , and i mistrust the whole lot of them to the same degree that i mistrust bake shops that call themselves `` sanitary_bake shops '' . 
`` o pioneers ! '' 
i think , and wonder what kind_of homesteads such odd pioneers would establish in_this suburban frontier ; pioneers who look_like off-duty gardeners even at parent-teacher conferences and who never call the school_principal `` mister '' . 
i sigh , think that among_other_things , people here seem to be those who would have to cut_down if they earn less_than $ 85000 yearly ; people who would give their teeth for a chance to get_on `` person to person '' ; people who think it be nice to be important , but not important to be nice ; who be more ingratiating than gracious , more personalities than persons . 
in my estimation , they be people who read daphne_du_maurier , and discuss kafka ; well , not discuss him exactly , but say , `` kafka '' ! 
reverently and raise their eyes , as if they be at_a_loss to describe how they feel about kafka , which they be , because they have no opinions about kafka , not having read kafka . 
they be , i feel , people invariably try to prove not who , but what they be , and try to determine what , not who , others be . 
become aware that it be nearly lunchtime , i bring myself back to the tasks at_hand . 
i make plans for the afternoon - do the breakfast and luncheon dishes all_at_once , make the beds , and_then maybe paint the kitchen . 
then , i remember that the girls had have a banana for dessert every_day for the last week . 
`` bananas '' ! 
jennie had shout each time . 
`` they be not dessert ! 
they be not even food . 
they be just something you 're supposed to put on cereal for breakfast '' . 
i dig around and find a mix , and be able to surprise them with a devil 's - food cake with chocolate icing . 
( sometimes i think you need only one rule for cooking : 
if you can n't put garlic in it , put chocolate in it . ) 
the cake was receive in a stunned silence that be evidence in itself of the dearth of taste thrills mama had been provide . 
then jennie close her eyes , stretch_forth her arms , and say : `` take my hand , louise ; i be a stranger in paradise '' . 
needless to say , i be furious at this unparalleled intrusion upon free_enterprise . 
how dare they demand to `` snoop '' in_private financial records , disbursements , confidential contracts and agreements ? 
`` it is as though '' , i say on the historic three-hour , coast-to-coast radio_broadcast which i buy ( follow father_coughlin and preempt the eddie_cantor , manhattan_merry-go-round and major_bowes shows ) `` that man in the white_house , like some despot of yore , insist on read my diary , raid my larder and ransack my lingerie ! '' 
my impassioned plea for civil_rights create a landslide of correspondence and one sponsor even ask me to consider replace the eddie_cantor comedy hour on a permanent basis . 
but what quarter could a poor defenseless woman expect from a dictator who would even make_bold so bold as to close all_of the banks in our great nation ? 
the savage barbarian hordes of red russian_communism descend on the athens that be mighty metronome , sack and despoil with their bolshevistic battle cry of `` soak the rich ' ! 
after an unspeakable siege , last the better part of two months , it was announce that the studio '' owe `` the government a tax debt in_excess of eight million dollars while i , who had always remain aloof from such iniquitous practices as paying taxes on the salary i had earn and the little i legally inherit as morris ' helpless relict , was '' sting `` with a personal bill of such astronomical proportions as to '' wipe_out `` all_but a fraction of my poor , hard-come-by savings . 
i was also publicly reprimand , drag_through_the_mud by the radical press and make a figure of fun by such leftist publications as the new_republic , the new_yorker , time and the christian_science monitor . 
it was then that i avail myself of the rights of a citizen and declare the income_tax unconstitutional . 
the litigation be costly and seemingly endless . 
i fight like a tigress but by the time i appeal my case to the supreme_court ( 1937 ) , mr._roosevelt and his `` henchmen '' had do their `` dirty work '' all_too well , even go so_far as to attempt to `` pack '' the highest tribunal in the land in_order_to defeat little me . 
presidential coercion had succeed not_only in poison the courtiers , `` toadies '' and sycophants of the `` bench '' against me , but it had be so far-reaching as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from represent me ! 
i be ready , like portia , to present my own brief . 
but the supreme_court would n't even hear my case ! 
my plea was unanimously vote_down and `` throw_out '' . 
again , my name be_on all the front pages . 
i be , it seem , persona_non_grata in every_quarter , but not entirely without a staunch following of noted political thinkers and students of jurisprudence . 
as charles_evans_hughes say , `` miss_poitrine 's limitations as an actress are exceed only by her logic as a litigant '' . 
albert_einstein was quote as say : `` the workings of the woman 's mind amaze me '' . 
henry_ford speak of me as `` utterly astounding '' . 
heywood_broun write : `` belle_poitrine be the_most original thinker since caligula '' , and even f._d._r. have to concede that `` if the rest of_this nation show the foresight and patriotism of miss_poitrine , america would rapidly resemble ancient babylon and nineveh '' . 
not_only be the court costs prohibitive , but i was subject to crippling fines , in_addition to usurious interest on the unpaid `` debts '' which the governmen claim that metronome and i owe - a severe financial blow . 
nor , as manny say , had the notoriety do_good my career `` any good '' . 
my enemies be only_too anxious to level against me such charges as `` reactionary '' , `` robber baroness '' , and even `` traitor '' ! 
traitor indeed ! 
i point now with_pride to the fact that , long ere the committee on un-american_activities , the minute_women , the economic_council and other such notable `` watchdog '' organizations were so_much as hear of , i be hollywood 's leading bulwark against communism , fight single-handedly `` creeping socialism '' against such insuperable odds as the fascio-communist troops of the nra , pwa , wpa , ccc and an army of more_than twenty-two million mercenaries whom f._d._r. employ secretly , through the transparent ruse of regular `` relief '' checks . 
needless to say , my art suffer drastically during this turbulent period . 
could it do otherwise ? 
even_though i have always have a genius for `` throw myself into '' every role and `` play it for all it 's worth '' , no actress can be expect to do her best work when her fortune , her reputation , her livelihood , her home and her nation itself are all imperilled . 
such sweeping distractions be hardly conducive to `` oscar '' winning performances . 
i try my hardest , with little help , may i say , from my husband and leading_man , but somehow the outside pressures be too severe . 
having ( through my unflagging effort and devotion ) achieve stardom , a fortune and a world-renowned wife at an age when most young_men are cast their first vote , letch proceed to neglect them all . 
never a `` quick study '' , he now make no attempt to learn his `` lines '' and many_a mile of film was waste , many_a scene - sometimes involve as_many as a_thousand fellow thespians - was take thirty , forty , fifty times because miss_poitrine 's co-star and `` helpmate '' had never learn his part . 
each time letch `` went_up '' in his `` lines '' , i be the one to be patient , helpful and apologetic while he indulge in outbursts of temperament , profanity and abuse , blame others , go into `` sulks '' and , on more occasions than i care to count , storm off the `` set '' for the rest of the day . 
as for his finances , i be never privileged to know exactly how much money letch had `` salt_away '' . 
it be i who pay for our little home , the food , the liquor , the servants - even letch 's bills at his tailor and the los_angeles athletic_club . 
never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third anniversary he give me a dislocated jaw . 
( but that be another story . ) 
as for his private monies , they were rapidly dissipate in drinking , gaming and carousing . 
more_than once i was confront by professional gamblers , `` bookies '' , loan `` sharks '' , gangsters , `` thugs '' and `` finger men '' - people of a class i did not even know exist - to repay my husband 's staggering losses , `` or_else '' . 
i shudder to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with such a sinister milieu . 
and at three different times during our turbulent marriage strange girls , with the commonest of accents , telephone to announce to me that letch had sire their unborn children ! 
have the deepest of maternal instincts , my heart fairly bleed when i think_of the darling pink and white `` bundles from heaven '' i would have proudly give my husband . 
`` ah , you be too old '' , be invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever i suggest `` start a family '' . 
letch had make it abundantly clear that he did not care_for the company of my own precious daughter . 
i now feel it wiser_to keep baby-dear in school and - during the summers - at a camp run by the society_of_friends all year around . 
her presence only make letch more distant and irritable and , in the hurry of buy chateau_belletch , i had neglect to consider a room for baby-dear , so there was no place to put her , anyhow . 
( i sometimes feel that god , in his infinite wisdom , want us to have these inexplicable little lapses of memory . 
it almost always work_out for the best . ) 
yet i adore this man , letch_feeley , why , i cannot say . 
with faint heart and a brave smile , i endure his long absences from chateau_belletch , his coldness , his indifference , his slights and his abuse . 
the times i can recall when i was publicly humiliate by him - lovely dinner_parties in our trianon suite where the collation was postpone and postpone and postpone , only to be serve dry and overcooked at a table where the host 's chair be vacant ; a `` splash party '' at the new pool , which i have build in the hope of keep_away letch away from public beaches , when letch and a certain aquacutie stay underwater together for the better part of an hour ; a lovely epiphany party at errol_flynn 's , on_which sacred occasion letch steal_away with an unknown `` starlet '' , leave me `` high and dry '' to get home as best i could . 
these be but a sampling of the insults i endure . 
as mrs._letch_feeley , be it any wonder that i , once the social arbiter of filmdom , was exclude from the smart entertainments give by the astaires , the coopers , the gables , the colmans , the rathbones , the taylors , the thalbergs and such devout , closely_knit families as the barrymores and the crosbys ? 
as letch 's antisocial conduct increase , our invitations decrease and my heart be in my mouth whenever i play hostess at a fashionable `` screenland '' gathering . 
between 1935 and 1939 letch and i make ten films together , each less successful , both artistically and commercially , than the one before it . 
our last joint_venture , sainted_lady , a deeply religious film base on the life of mother_cabrini , and time so_that its release date would coincide with the beatification of america 's first saint in november , 1938 , be a fiasco from_start_to_finish . 
as i was play mother_cabrini , the picture be actually `` all mine '' , with nearly every scene build around me . 
but in_order_to keep letch in_the_public_eye and out of trouble , i write in a part especially for him - that of a dashing ruffian who `` see the light '' and is save by the inspiring example of mother_cabrini . 
and did he appreciate my efforts on his behalf ? 
did he trouble to memorize the very small part which i have `` tailor-made '' to his specifications , a role eventually cut_down to three short speeches ? 
did he show the rest of the cast - number four thousand - the consideration of arrive_at the studio punctually - or even at_all ? 
he did not ! 
the `` shooting '' go_on for eight months ! 
most_of our working_days were spend on the telephone call `` bookies '' , illegal gambling_dens , a certain `` residential club for young_actresses '' , more_than a_hundred different bars or the steam_room of the athletic club . 
whenever he deign to appear at the studio he be `` hung_over '' , uncooperative , rude and insulting . 
he make many tasteless , irreverent and unfunny remarks , not_only about me in the title_role , but about religion in_general . 
by the time the film was release we be three million dollars over-spent , war be imminent and the public apparently had forget all about mother_cabrini . 
thanks to letch_feeley and the terrible strain he impose on me , the notices be few and unfavorable . 
only george_santayana seem to understand and appreciate the film when he write : `` miss_poitrine has perpetrate the_most eloquent argument for the protestant faith yet unleash by hollywood '' . 
but it be small consolation . 
in a rare fit of anger and spite , i `` farm_out '' my own husband to a small and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment . 
( an actor must have discipline . ) 
the film was call the diet of worms , which i feel be just what letch deserve . 
it turn_out to be a life of martin_luther , of all things ! 
it be a disaster ! 
in clothes , letch simply did not project . 
he was laugh_off the screen . 
at_the_same_time , however , i avail myself of the services of_that great english actor and master of make-up , sir_gauntley_pratt , to do a `` quickie '' called the mystery of the mad_marquess , in_which i play a young american girl who inherit a haunted castle on the_english moors which is fill with secret passages and sliding panels and , unbeknownst to anyone , is still occupy by an eccentric maniac . 
it be a `` potboiler '' make on a `` shoestring '' and not the sort_of film i like , as all i have to do be look blank and scream a great_deal . 
my heart be not in it , but , oddly_enough , it remain the_most financially successful picture of my career . 
( i watch it on television late one night last week and it `` stand_up '' remarkably well , even twenty years later . ) 
letch had return from his debacle unrepentant and more badly_behaved than before . 
i really love that boy , and , in a feverish attempt to preserve our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful , wonderful person letch had once be , i take my troubles to momma , hope that her earthy advice would help me . 
`` if i could only think_of something at the studio , near me , to absorb his boundless energy '' , i say . 
`` what be letch interested in '' ? 
`` bookies , booze and babes '' , momma say bluntly . 
her reply sting me , but this be too important to let my hurt make any difference . 
`` i can n't turn_into the studio into a gambling_hell or a saloon '' , i say .
