he 'll even bull head-on into the rule when he is sure he 's right . 
that 's how he first win the masters in 1958 . 
it happen on the twelfth hole , a 155 - yarder . 
person 's iron shot from the tee burrow into the bunker guard the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rain , thereby bring local rule into force . 
`` i can remove the ball , can't i '' ? ask person of an official . 
`` no '' , say the official . 
`` you must play it where it lie '' . 
`` you 're wrong '' , say person , a man who know the rule . 
`` i 'll do as you say , but i 'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling '' . 
he score a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one . 
the golfing father rule_in his favor . 
so he pick_up a stroke with the provisional ball and win the tournament by the margin of that stroke . 
until a_few week ago , however , person be some godlike creature who have nothing in_common with the duffer . 
but after that 12 at los_angeles he become one_of_the_boys , a bigger hero than he ever had be before . 
a formula to supply player for the new group and the problem of increase the 1961 schedule to fourteen game will be discuss by group owner at a meeting at the group today .

the owner would_like each club in the fourteen team league to play a home and home series with team in its division , plus two game against team in the other division . 
however , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen week . 
person , the league commissioner , point_out : 
`` we 'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other '' . 
nine of the league 's team play in baseball park and therefore face an early season conflict in date . 
if the cardinals heed person of the group , they won't be mislead by the group ' slow start this season .

tonight at 8 o'clock the group , who give the group as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 , break_even with them , will get their first 1961 shot at baseball 's world champion . 
the group have a 9 - 6 record this year and the group be 7 - 9 . 
person announce a switch in his starting_pitcher , from person to person , for several reason : 
1 . 
person 's 4 - 0 won-lost_record and 1.24 earned_run mark against group a year ago ; 2 . 
the desire to give person as many start as possible ; 3 . 
the group ' disheartening 11 - 7 collapse against the group sunday . 
person , eager to end a pitching slump that has bring four loss in the five game on the current home stand , move person to the wednesday night starting assignment .

`` i have to stay with person for_a_while '' , person say . 
`` person ( sore ankle ) should be ready . 
with a left-hander go for group , i may use person in center '' . 
`` person throw bat practice about 25 minute , and he look good '' , person say . 
`` he should be get_back in_the_groove before_long . 
our pitching be much better than it has show '' .

person with .179 and person with .143 be the only group drag_one's_feet . 
perhaps the group who will be the unhappy over the news that person probably will sit_out most of the series be person , who was beat by person twice last season on dramatic home_run . 
person be off to a great start with a 4 - 0 record but be n't likely to see action here this week . 
`` we 're get person some run for a change , and he has been pitch good '' , person say . 
`` person has been blast the ball . 
no plunker for him '' . 
the group jump_off to an 11 - 3 start by may 1 last year , when the group as_well_as the group hold them even over the season . 
on last may 1 , the group stand at 7 - 6 , end a two season falloff on that milestone . 
in 1958 , group be 3 - 10 on may 1 . 
a year later they be 4 - 13 . 
since 1949 , the st._louis club has be below .500 on may 1 just four time .

`` by win against group , group and group on those team ' home court , they show that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn 's take a super team to do_it '' . 
group find a way to win a baseball_game . 
person last night pitch a no-hit_game , say to be the first in group baseball history , as the group beat group , 5 - 1 , at location . 
the victory be the first of the season for the group after nine defeat and a tie . 
the tie was against group last friday .

the group be set to play at group at 3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at location , location , saturday . 
if it 's true that contented cow give more milk , why should n't happy ball player produce more base_hit ? 
the two top talent of the time , person and person , have hit the ball hard and more successfully so_far this early season than at any period in career which , to be frank about it , never have quite reach expectation . 
and that 's mean as a boost , not a knock . 
person and person , both 10 - year man at 30 , have so much ability that , baseball man agree , they 've never hit the height . 
their height , that_is . 
person , the bullnecked blond switch-hitter , have one sensational triple-crown_season , 1959 , when he bat .365 and also lead the group in home_run , 52 , and rbi , 130 . 
like the group ' slugger , person , the terror of the group , has have season that would be consider the ultimate by most player , but not by - or for - person . 
his best year be 1954 when he hit .345 with 41 homer and '55 when he belt 51 home_run , drive_in 127 and steal 24 base . 
now , apparently happy under new manager , person and person , the perfect player , are behave as though they 're going_to pass those previous peak . 
yes , we know , they 're professional , man paid to play , and they should n't care how they 're handle , just as_long_as their name are spell correctly on the first and fifteenth of each_month . 
the truth be , though , that man react differently to different treatment . 
for_that_matter , person be rare , possess the disposition that enable him to put_out the same for seven manager , reserve his opinion , but not his effort . 
person , it 's apparent , resent person 's attempt to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager see as a thrilling possibility . 
the old_man be almost too possessive . 
person inherit person , person , but he bring_up person from class c to the majors , from location to location . 
with the speed and power of the body beautiful he see before him , person want no. 7 to be not_only the best home_run hitter , but also the best bunter , base_runner and outfielder . 
person probably preach too_much in the early day when the kid want to pop his bubble_gum and sow_one's_oats . 
inherit a more mature person , who now has see the sight on and off location , person quietly bestow , no pun intend , the mantle of authority on person . 
the person decide that , rather_than be lead , the slugger could lead . 
and what leadership a proud person has give so_far . 
the opinion continue here that with a 162 - game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10 - team league and a most inviting target in los_angeles ' location , person just might break the most glamorous record on the book , person 's 60 homer of 1927 . 
person ' day come a day early for person than for the kid and commie this year . 
person 's wonderful walloping sunday - four home_run - serve merely to emphasize how happy he be to be play for person . 
next to person , person teach person the most when he be a grass green rookie rush up_to the location 10 year ago this month , to help the group win a dramatic pennant .

an electric_toothbrush ( broxodent ) may soon take its place next to the electric_razor in the american bathroom . 
the brush move up_and_down and be small enough to clean every dental surface , include the back of the tooth . 
in_addition , the motor have the seal_of_approval of the group , which mean it be safe .

several dentist and patient with special dental problem have experiment with the device . 
the result be good although they be difficult to compare with hand brushing , particularly when the individual know how to brush his tooth properly . 
the electric gadget be most helpful when there be many crowned tooth and in individual who be elderly , bedfast with a chronic disease , or are handicap by disorder such_as cerebral_palsy or muscular_dystrophy . 
but for many_of us , it will prove an enjoyable luxury . 
it be not as convenient as the old type toothbrush and the paste tend to shimmy of the bristle .

an ordinary hot bath or shower will do the same . 
write : what make my hand numb when sewing ?

write : does the cholesterol go_down when most of the thyroid_gland is remove ? 
no . 
it usually go_up . 
the cholesterol level in the blood is influence by the gland of the body . 
it be low when the thyroid be overactive and high when the gland be sluggish . 
the latter be likely to occur when the thyroid is remove . 
the gap between the bookshelf and the record cabinet grow small with each new recording catalogue . 
there 's more reading and instruction to be hear on disc than ever before , although the spoken rather_than the sung word be as old as person 's first experiment in recorded sound . 
person could hardly have guess , however , that person would one day appear in stereo . 
if the record buyer 's taste be somewhat eclectic or even the slight bit esoteric , he will find them satisfy on educational record . 
and he will avoid eyestrain in the process . 
everything from poetry to phonetics , history to histrionics , philosophy to party_game has been adapt to the turntable . 
for sheer ambition , take the group series title modestly `` wisdom '' . 
volume one and two , select from the soundtrack of a television series , contain `` conversation with the elder wise_man of our day '' . 
these sage include poet person , statesman person and sculptor person , in volume one , and playwright person , person , philosopher person and the late person in the second set . 
person is hear interview person , for an added prestige fillip . 
there 's more specialization and a narrow purpose in two album recently issue by group . 
group `` publish '' what the company call `` listen_and_learn '' production design to teach foreign language . 
previous presentation have be on french , spanish , russian , italian , german and japanese . 
but the firm has recognize the tight dollar and the tourist 's desire to visit the `` smaller , less traveled and relatively inexpensive country '' , and be now prepared to teach modern_greek and portuguese through recording .

thanks to spoken_arts_records , history buff may hear person 's `` most memorable speech and letter '' in a two disc set , interpret by person authority and lecturer person .

for those who `` like poetry but never get_around_to read it '' , the group make it possible for poet to be hear read their own work . 
the program was institute in 1940 , and release be available only from the group of the group , washington 25 , location a catalogue be available on_request . 
new on the list be person , person , person , person , person , person , person , person , person and person . 
two poet are pair on each record , in the order give above . 
group be not the only large commercial company to impart instruction . 
group have an ambitious and useful project in a stereo series called `` adventure in music '' , which be an instructional record library for elementary_school . 
person and the group perform in the first two release , design for grade one and two . 
teaching guide are include with each record . 
in an effort to fortify himself against the unforeseen upset sure to arise in the future , person , banker editor of the phoenix `` group '' , reflect upon a_few of the depressing experience of the feverish fifties . 
one of the rough be the tv quiz show , which give him inferiority_complex . 
though it be a great relief when the big brain on these show turn_out to be fraud and phony , it do irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many_another intelligent , well-informed american . 
but the one that upset the financially wise be the professional dancer who relate in a book how he parlay his earnings into a $ 2000000 profit on the stock_market . 
every man who dabble_in the market to make a_little easy_money on_the_side and suffer losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wonder how her husband could be so dumb . 
investor breathe more freely when it was learn that this acrobatic dancer had turn magician and was only do a best_seller book to make some dough . 
people who take_for us for sucker be like the westerner who have on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form of a number of bull's_eye achievement . 
the promoter who want to sign_up him up for the circus ask him how he be able to do it . 
his answer be simple but honest . 
he just shoot at the board and_then draw circle around the hole to form a bull's_eye . 
one of the obstacle to the easy control of a 2 - year old child be a lack of verbal communication . 
the child understand no . 
he sense his mother 's disapproval . 
but explanation leave him confused and unmoved . 
if his mother love him , he cling_to that love as a ballast . 
it motivate his behavior . 
he want mommy to think him a good boy . 
he does n't want her to look frowningly at him , or speak_to him angrily . 
this breaks_his_heart . 
he want to be call sweet , good , considerate and mother 's little helper . 
but even mother 's loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior . 
his desire be so strong that he need constant reassurance of his mother 's love for him and what she expect of him , in_order to overcome them . 
his own inner voice , which should tell him what not to do , has not develop . 
it won't develop until he have words with which to clothe it . 
the conscience be nonexistent in the 2 - year old . 
what can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior ? 
she can decrease the number of temptation . 
she can remove all knickknacks within reach . 
the fewer no she has_to utter the more effective they will be . 
she should offer substitute for the temptation which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child . 
if he can't play with mommy 's magazine , he should have some old number of his own . 
if daddy 's book be out-of-bounds his own picture_book be not . 
toy he have can be make to act_as substitute for family temptation such_as refrigerator and gas_stove . 
during this precarious period of development the mother should continue to influence the growth of the child 's conscience . 
she tell him of the consequence of his behavior . 
if he bite a playmate she say , `` person won't like you '' . 
if he snatch a toy , she say , `` person want her own truck just as you do '' . 
there be no use try to `` explain '' to a 2 - year old . 
action speak loud . 
remove temptation . 
remove the child from the scene of his misbehavior . 
substitute approved object for forbidden ones and keep tell him how he is to act . 
he won't submit to his natural desire all_the_time , and it be mother 's love that is responsible_for his good behavior . 
the nuclear war is already being fight , except that the bomb are not being drop on enemy target - not_yet . 
it is being fight , moreover , in fairly close correspondence with the prediction of the soothsayer of the think_factory . 
they predict escalation , and escalation be what we are get . 
the biggest nuclear device the united_states has explode measure some 15 megaton , although our b-52 are say to be carry two 20 - megaton_bomb apiece . 
some time ago , however , person decide that when bigger bomb were make , the soviet_union would make them . 
he seem to have at_least a_few 30 - and 50 - megaton_bomb on_hand , since we cannot assume that he has explode his entire stock . 
and now , of_course , the hue_and_cry for counter escalation is being raise on our side . 
person threaten us with a 100 - megaton_bomb ? 
so_be_it - then we must embark_on a crash program for 200 - megaton_bomb of the common or hydrogen variety , and neutron_bomb , which do not exist but are say to be the coming thing . 
so escalation proceed , ad_infinitum or , more accurately , until the contestant begin drop them on each other instead_of on their respective proving_ground . 
what is needed , person write in the_cornell_daily_sun ( october 26 ) be a discontinuity . 
the escalation must end sometime , and probably quite soon . 
`` only a discontinuity can end it '' , person write . 
`` the discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy '' . 
person point_out that since our country is more urbanized than the soviet_union or red_china , it be the most vulnerable of the great_power - europe of_course must be write_off out_of_hand . 
he feel , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the united_states be the least risky path our government can take . 
his proposal be opposed to that of person , person , past chairman person and person of the group , person and those others now enjoy their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold_war . 
these gentleman are call_for a resumption of testing - in the atmosphere - on the greatest possible scale , all in_the_name_of national security . 
escalation be their first love and their last ; they will be faithful unto death . 
capable as their mind may be in some direction , these guardian of the nation 's security be incapable of learn , or even of observe . 
if this capacity had not fail them , they would see that their enemy has make a disastrous miscalculation . 
he has gain only one thing - he has explode a 50 - megaton_bomb and he probably have rocket with sufficient thrust to lob it over the short intercontinental range . 
but if his purpose be to inspire terror , his action could hardly have miscarry more obviously . 
not terror , but anger and resentment have be the general reaction outside the soviet sphere . 
person himself is report to be concern by the surge of animosity he has arouse , yet our own nuclear statesman seem intent_on follow compulsively in his footstep . 
when one powerful nation strive to emulate the success of another , it be only natural . 
thus , when the russian send up their first sputnik , american chagrin be human enough , and american determination to put american satellite into orbit be perfectly understandable . 
but to imitate an opponent when he has make the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly . 
when east_german flee to the west by the thousand , paean of joy rise from the throat of western publicist . 
they be less vocal now , when it be the west_berliner who are migrate . 
the flood be not as great - only 700 a week according_to one apparently conservative account - but it be symptomatic . 
location morale be low and , in age distribution , the situation be unfavorable . 
nearly 18 percent of location 's 2200000 resident be sixty-five or older , only 12.8 percent be under fifteen . 
person , m.p. , write in the_manchester_guardian , state that departure from location are now run at the rate not of 700 , but of 1700 a week , and application to leave have rise to 1900 a week . 
the official statistic show that 60 percent be employed worker or independent professional people . 
whole family are move and removal_firm be booked for month ahead . 
the weekly loss is partly counterbalance by 500 arrival each_week from location , but the hard truth , say person , be that `` the closing_off of location without interference from the west and with the use only of east_german , as distinct from russian , troops be a major communist victory , which deal location a deadly , possibly a fatal , blow . 
the gallant half city is die on_its_feet '' . 
another piece of evidence appear in a dispatch from bonn in the observer ( london ) . 
person write : `` people are leave [ location ] because they think it is die . 
they are leave so fast that the president of the location issue an appeal this week to factory_worker in the west to volunteer for six month ' front_line work in factory in location . 
berlin 's resilience be amazing , but if it has to hire its labor in the west the struggle will be hard indeed '' . 
the handwriting be on_the_wall . 
the only hope for location lie_in a compromise which will bring_down the wall and reunite the city . 
state_department official refuse to show their pass at the boundary , and drive two block into location under military escort , will not avail . 
tank line_up at the border will be no_more helpful . 
the material for compromise be at_hand : the nation , person and other sober commentator ( see person on p. 367 ) have spell_out them out again_and_again . 
a compromise will leave both side without the glow of triumph , but it will save location . 
or the city can be a graveyard monument to western intransigence , if that be what the west want . 
the removal of person 's body from the mausoleum he share with person to less distinguished quarters in the location wall is not unprecedented in history . 
it be , in_fact , a relatively mild chastisement of the dead . 
a british writer , person , in a book , dead_men_tell_tales , recall that in the turmoil precede french_revolution the body of person , , who had die nearly 180 year earlier , was tear to piece by a mob . 
and in location , after the restoration , the body of person was disinter and hang at location . 
the head was then fix on a pole at location , and the rest of the body was bury under the gallows . 
contemplate these posthumous punishment , person should not lose all hope . 
in 1899 , group erect a statue to person in location , face location and there , presumably , he still stand . 
person , however , has create yet another problem for himself . 
the person tomb be obviously adequate for double occupancy , moscow be a crowded city , and the creed of communism deplore waste . 
who will take person 's place beside person ? 
there is person , of_course , bury in london . 
the person government might be will to let_go_of him go , but he has be dead seventy-eight year and even the soviet mortician could not make him look presentable . 
who , then , be of sufficient stature to lodge with person ? 
who but person himself ? 
since he has just show who be top_dog , he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the soviet people . 
besides , he can hardly avoid muse on the instability of death which , what with exhumation and rehabilitation , seem to match that of life . 
suppose he did lie beside person , would it be permanent ? 
if some future person decide to rake_up the misdeed of his revered predecessor , would not the factory_worker pass the same resolution applaud his dispossession ? 
when a man is lay_to_rest , he is entitle to stay_put . 
if person buy a small plot in some modest rural cemetery , everyone will understand . 
the appointment of person of burma as the group acting secretary_general - at this writing , the choice appear to be certain - offer further proof that in politics it be more important to have no influential enemy than to have influential friend . 
person of tunisia and person of ireland be early favorite in_the_running , but france did n't like the former and the soviet_union would have none of the latter . 
with the neutralist maintain pressure for one of their own to succeed person , person emerge as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylay by a veto . 
what be interesting be that his positive qualification for the post were reveal only as a kind of tail to his candidacy . 
in all the bitter in-fighting , the squabble over election procedure , the complicated numbers_game that east and west play on the assistant secretary ' theme , the gentleman from burma show himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat . 
he have , moreover , another qualification which augur well for the future . 
he be a buddhist , which mean that to him peace and the sanctity of human life be not_only religious dogma , but a profound and unshakable weltanschauung . 
person of_course , will hold office until the spring of 1963 , when person 's term would have come to an end . 
whether the compromise - on both side - that make_possible the interim appointment can then be repeat remain to be see . 
person 's demand for a troika be dormant , not dead ; the west may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that person represent . 
in_a_sense , the showdown promise by person 's sudden and tragic death has been avoid ; no precedent have been set as_yet ; structurally , the group be still fluid , vulnerable to the pressure that its new and enlarged membership are bring_to_bear upon it . 
but at_least the pessimist who believe that the world_organization had plunge to its death in that plane crash in the congo have been prove wrong . 
no one who has study the radical right can suppose that words be their sole staple in trade . 
these be mentality which crave action - and they are begin to get_it , as person and person report on page 372 . 
even in area where political connotation are ( deliberately ? ) 
leave vague , the spirit of vigilantism is spread . 
friends , a picture magazine distribute by group dealer , describe a paramilitary_organization of employee of the group at location , location . 
`` if the day should ever come that foreign invader swarm ashore along the group '' , the account read , `` they can count_on heavy opposition from a group of commando trained telephone employee - all girl . 
heavily armed and mobilize as a fast moving civil_defense outfit , 23 telephone_operator and office personnel stand ready to move_into action at a minute 's notice '' . 
according_to friends , the unit was organize by person , a former world_war_/2 , commando who be vice_president and general_manager of the telephone_company . 
the girl , very fetching in their uniform , are show fire rocket from a launcher mount on a dump_truck ; they are also train with carbine , automatic weapon , pistol , rifle and other such lady ' accessory . 
this may be opera_bouffe now , but it will become more serious should the cold_war mount in frenzy . 
the country be committed to the doctrine of security by military means . 
the doctrine has never work ; it is not work now . 
the official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms ; it cannot bring them into actual play . 
a more dangerous formula for national frustration cannot be imagine . 
as the civic temper rise , the more naive citizen begin to play soldier - but the gun be real . 
soon they will begin to hunt_down the traitor they be assure be in our midst . 
it is not news that person be a wizard of the violin . 
certainly not in location where he has play countless recital , and where thursday night he celebrate his 20th season with the group , play the brahms_concerto with his own slashing , demon-ridden cadenza melt into the high , pale , pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlock the heart of the music , or forever find it closed . 
there be about that song something incandescent , for this location be person at white_heat . 
not the noble performance we have hear him play , or the most spacious , or even the most eloquent . 
those would be reserve for the orchestra 's great night when the soloist can surpass himself . 
this time the orchestra give him some superb support fire by response to his own high mood . 
but he have in person a willing conductor able only up to a point . 
that_is , when person thrust straight to the core of the music , spark fly , bow shred , violin singing , glitter and sometimes spit , person could go_along . 
but person does not go straight to any point . 
he flounder and let music sprawl . 
there be in the person none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist , orchestra and music to ultimate fusion . 
so we have some dazzling and memorable person , but not great person . 
the concert open with another big romantic score , person overture_to_manfred , which suffer fate , this time with orchestral thrust to the byronic point to keep it afloat . 
person 's joust with person tune be a considerably more serious misfortune , for it demand translucent texture , buoyant rhythm , and astringent wit . 
it get the kind of scrambled , coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestra when the man with the baton lack technique and style . 
the bayreuth_festival open july 23 with a new production of `` tannhaeuser '' stage by person , who is do all the opera this time , and conduct by person . 
person also conduct `` the_flying_dutch '' , open july 24 . 
`` parsifal '' follow july 25 , with person conduct , and he also conduct `` die_meistersinger '' , to be present aug 8 and 12 . 
the `` ring '' cycle be july 26 , 27 , 28 and 30 , and aug 21 , 22 , 23 and 25 . 
person conduct . 
no cast are list , but person send_word that the negro soprano , person , will sing venus in `` tannhaeuser '' . 
remember how by a series of booking absurdity chicago miss see the group ? 
remember how by lack of two big theater chicago miss the first visit of the group ? 
well , now we have two big theater . 
but bar a miracle , and do n't hold your breath for it , chicago will not see the group , which stem from the ballet cradle of the group and be one of the great company of the world . 
before you let_loose a howl say we announce its coming , not once but several time , indeed we did . 
the engagement was_supposed_to be all set for the big theater in location , which person , ballet booker extraordinary , consider the finest house of its kind in the country - and of_course he does n't weep at the capacity , either . 
it was all set . 
group corporation first list the chicago date as dec 4 thru 10 . 
later the person office make it dec 8 thru 17 , a nice , long booking for the full repertory . 
but if you keep a calendar of event , as we do , you notice a conflict . 
group had book person into location dec 8 and 9 . 
something had to give . 
not person . 
group then notify us that the group would cut_short its los_angeles booking , fly here to open nov 28 , and close dec 2 . 
short booking , but still a booking . 
we print it . 
a_couple_of day later a balletomane tell me he had telephone group for ticket information and was tell `` the newspaper had make a mistake '' . 
so i start make some call of my own . 
these be the result . 
the group is firmly book into the location , los_angeles , nov 21 thru dec 4 . 
not a chance of open here nov 28 - bar that miracle . 
then why not the juicy booking person had hold for us ? 
well , person won't budge from group . 
then how about the group ? 
well , group has book person there for a week start dec 4 . 
query about the impasse , group say : `` better cancel the group for_the_time_being . 
it 's all up_in_the_air again '' . 
so the group will fly back to russia , minus a chicago engagement , a serious loss for dance fan - and for the frustrated booker , cancellation of one of the rich booking in the country . 
will somebody please reopen the auditorium ? 
painting and drawing by person of location , virgin_islands , are show thru nov 5 at the location , 3211 location , weekday , 3 pm to 8 pm , sunday 3 pm to 6 pm , close monday . 
an exhibition of person 's painting will open with a reception nov 5 at the location , 828 location . 
it will continue all month . 
abstraction and semi abstraction by person are being exhibit by the location until nov 5 . 
in the line of operatic trade to cushion the budget , the group will use san_francisco 's new group production of `` lucia_di_lammermoor '' this season , return the favor next season when san_francisco use the dallas `` don_giovanni '' , design by person . 
person has scribble a farce called `` hark_,_hark_,_the_lark '' ! 
it be one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novel of the season . 
if there is a moral lurk among the shenanigan , it be hard to find . 
perhaps the lesson we should take from these page be that the welfare_state in england still allow wild scope for all kind of rugged eccentric . 
anyway , a number of them meet here in devastating collision . 
one be an imperial london stockbroker called person . 
another be a wily countryman called person , whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicle , i believe , in early volume of person ' comedie_humaine . 
what 's up now ? 
well , person and his wife person have reach the stage of affluence that stir a longing for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicity . 
they want to own a junior-grade castle , or a manor_house , or some modest little place where shakespeare might once have stage a pageant for person and all her bearded courtier . 
they are willing to settle , however , in anything that offer pheasant to shoot at and peasant to work_at . 
and of_course person have just the thing they want . 
it 's a horror . 
the name of_it be location , and it is surround by a wasteland that would impress person . 
that 's not precisely the way person urge them to look_at it , though . 
he conjure_up herd of deer , and wild bird crowd the air . 
he suggest that location embody all the glory of tudor splendor . 
the stained-glass_window may have develop unpremeditated patina , the paneling may be no more durable than the plank in a political_platform . 
the vast , dungeon kitchen may seem hardly worth use except on occasion when one is face with a_thousand unexpected guest for lunch . 
person have an answer to all that . 
the spaciousness of the tudor cooking area , for_example , will provide needed space for the extra television_set require by modern butler , cook and maid . 
also , perhaps , table_tennis and other indoor sport to keep them fit and contented . 
it 's a wonder , really , to how much mendacious trouble person put himself to sell the person that preposterous manse . 
he does n't really need the immense sum_of_money ( probably convert from american gold on the group ) he make them pay . 
for person is already wonderfully content with his lot . 
he have a glorious wife and many child . 
when he need money to buy something like , say , the rolls-royce he keep near his vegetable_patch , he takes_a_flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies . 
one of those capital_gain venture , in_fact , has saddle him with location . 
he is willing to sell it just to get_it_off_his_hands . 
and the person are more_than willing to buy it . 
they plan to become county people who know the proper way to terminate a fox 's life on earth . 
if , in person 's eye , they be nothing but location farmer , he have as much to learn about them as they have to learn about the way of truly rural living . 
person show us how this mutual education spread its inevitable havoc . 
one-upmanship is practice by both side in a total war . 
first the person be ahead , then the person . 
after person has been persuade to restock his tangled acres with pheasant , he poach only what he need for the nourishment of his family and local caller . 
one of the local caller , a retired brigadier apparently left_over from kipling 's tale of india , do not approve of the way person get his bird . 
he does n't think that pot them from a deck_chair on the south_side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting . 
but the brigadier dine on the bird with relish . 
it is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet make from person ' `` don_quixote '' be the brilliant russian spectacle , do in wide-screen and color , which open yesterday at the location and group . 
more_than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventure and escapade of the tragicomic knight-errant and his squire , person , in seventeenth century spain , this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry be an affectingly warm and human exposition of character . 
person , the russian actor who has play such_as heroic role as person and person , perform the lanky don_quixote , and does so with a simple dignity that bridge the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man . 
his addlebrained knight-errant , self appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegate to museum and the chivalrous code of knight_errantry had become a joke , be , as person no_doubt intend , a gaunt but gracious symbol of good , move soberly and sincerely in a world of cynic , hypocrite and rogue . 
person does not caricature him , as some actor have been incline to do . 
he treat this deep-eyed , bearded , bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect . 
direct by person in a tempo that is studiously slow , he develop a sense of a high tradition shine brightly and pass gravely through an impious world . 
the complexity of communication have been considerably abet in this case by appropriately stilted english_language that has been excellently dub in_place_of the russian dialogue . 
the voice of all the character , include that of person , have richness , roughness or color to conform with the personality . 
and the subtlety of the dialogue are most helpfully convey . 
since russian was being speak instead of spanish , there be no violation of artistry or logic here . 
splendid , too , be the performance of person , one of russia 's leading comedian , as person , the fat , grotesque `` squire '' . 
though his character be broad and more comically rounded than the don , he give it a firmness and toughness - a sort_of peasant dignity - too . 
it be really as though the russian have see in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoon . 
the episode in which person conclude the joke that is play on him when he be facetiously put in command of an `` island '' be one of the best in the film . 
true , the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary quality that be a_bit wearisome in the first_half , before don_quixote go to the duke 's court . 
but strength and poignancy develop thenceforth , and the windmill and deathbed episode gather the thread of realization of the wonderfulness of the old_boy . 
there be other good representation of peasant and people of the court by actor who are finely costume and magnificently photograph in this last of the russian film to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange . 
also on the bill at the location be a nice ten minute color film called `` sunday_in_greenwich_village '' , a tour of the haunt and joint . 
television has yet to work_out a living_arrangement with jazz , which come to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family . 
there seem to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of chicago style jazz in prime_time evening time , for_example , could not be justify without the trimming of a portentous documentary . 
at_least this seem to be the working hypothesis for `` chicago and all that jazz '' , present on group - tv nov 26 . 
the program come_out of the group special project department , and was slot in the du_pont_show of the week series . 
perhaps special project necessarily think along documentary line . 
if so , it might be worthwhile to assign a future jazz show to a different department - one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut_down on the number of performer and give them a_little room to display their talent . 
as_a_matter_of_fact , this latter approach has already been try , and with pleasing result . 
a_few year ago a `` group all star jazz show '' offer a broad range of style , range from person 's big_band to the freewheeling group . 
an enthusiastic audience confirm the `` live '' character of the hour , and provide the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seem to improve the quality of performance . 
about that same time person 's tv series on the popular art prove again that give jazz ample breathing_space be one of the most sensible thing a producer can do . 
in an hour remember for its almost rudderless movement , a score of jazz luminary go before the camera for lengthy period . 
the program had been arrange to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music . 
camera stare at soloist ' face in extreme closeup , then considerately pull_back for full view of ensemble work . 
`` chicago and all_that_jazz '' could not be fault on the choice of artist . 
some of the in-person performer be person , person , person , person , person , person , person , person , person . 
the jazz buff could hardly ask for more . 
furthermore , person make an ideal master_of_ceremonies . 
( he play host at the group show already mention . ) 
one of the script 's big problem be how to blend picture and music of the past with live performance by musician of today . 
group had gather a_lot of historical material which it be eager to share . 
for_example , there be sheet_music with the word `` jazz '' in the title , to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin take_hold . 
sample zoom into closeup range in regular succession , like telephone_pole pass on the highway , while representative music reinforce the mood of the late teens and 1920 's . 
however well-chosen and cleverly arrange , such memorabilia unfortunately amount to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening 's main business , which ( consider the talent at_hand ) should probably have be the gathering of fresh sample of the chicago style . 
another source of group pride be its rare film_clip of person , but this view of the great trumpeter fly_by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blot_out the entire glimpse . 
similarly , in present still photograph of early jazz_group , the program allow no time for a close perusal . 
`` chicago and all that jazz '' may have wind_up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer . 
by try to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today 's artist , the program turn_out to be a not quite perfect example of either . 
still , the network 's willingness to experiment in this musical field be to be commend , and future essay happily anticipate . 
even person may not have anticipate the tremendous reception she receive from the metropolitan_opera audience attend her debut as person in person 's `` lucia_di_lammermoor '' sunday night . 
the crowd stage its own mad scene in salvo of cheer and applause and finally a standing_ovation as person take curtain_call after curtain_call following a fantastic `` mad_scene '' create on_her_own and with the help of the composer and the other performer . 
her entrance in scene_2_,_act_1 , bring some disconcerting applause even before she had sing a note . 
thereafter the audience wax applause happy , but discriminating operagoer reserve judgment as her singing show sign of strain , her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization . 
as she gain composure during the second act , her technical resourcefulness emerge strong , though she had already reveal a trill almost unprecedented in year of performance of `` lucia '' . 
she top the sextet brilliantly . 
each high note have the crowd in ecstasy so that it stop the show midway in the `` mad_scene '' , but the real reason be a realization of the extraordinary performance unfold at the moment . 
person appear almost as another person in this scene : a much more girlish person , a sensational coloratura who run across stage while singing , and an actress immerse in her role . 
what follow the outburst bring almost breathless silence as person reveal her mastery of a voice probably unique among soprano today . 
this big , flexible voice with uncommon range has been superbly disciplined . 
nervousness at_the_start must have cause the blemish of her first scene , or she may warm_up slowly . 
in the fullness of her vocal splendor , however , she could sing the famous scene magnificently . 
technically it be fascinating , aurally spellbinding , and dramatically quite realistic . 
many year have pass since a metropolitan audience hear anything comparable . 
her debut over , perhaps the early scene will emerge equally fine . 
the performance also mark the debut of a most promising young conductor , person . 
he inject more vitality into the score than it has reveal in many year . 
he may respect too_much the italian tradition of let singer hold_on to their note , but to restrain them in a singer ' opera may be quite difficult . 
person sing person in glorious voice . 
his bel_canto style give the performance a special distinction . 
the remainder of the cast fulfill its assignment no more_than satisfactorily just as the old production and limited stage_direction prove only serviceable . 
person first sing person at location in 1959 . 
( the first group broadcast on dec 9 will introduce her as person . ) 
she has since turn_to person , whose opera `` beatrice_di_tenda '' in a concert version with the group introduce her to new_york last season . 
she will sing `` la_sonambula '' with it here next week . 
anyone for musical ping-pong ? 
it 's really quite fun as_long_as you like game . 
you will need a stereo music system , with speaker preferably place at_least seven or eight foot apart , and one or more of the new london `` phase 4 '' record . 
there be 12 of these to choose from , all_of them of popular_music except for the star release , pass_in_review ( sp 44001 ) . 
this feature the march song of several nation , record as though the various national band were march by your reviewing_stand . 
complete with crowd effect , interruption by jet_plane , and sundry other touch of realism , this disc display london 's new technique to the good effect . 
all_of the jacket carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program . 
no reference is make to the possibility of record other_than popular_music in this manner , and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious_music . 
directionality is greatly exaggerate most_of the time ; but when the sound of the two speaker are allow to mix , there be excellent depth and dimension to the music . 
you definitely hear some of the instrument close_up and others far back , with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instrument merely be loud than the ones far back . 
this be a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantage over monaural sound . 
group explain that the very distinct directional effect in the phase 4 series be due in large part to their novel method of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channel . 
these are then mix by their sound engineer with the active cooperation of the musical staff and combine into the final two channel which are impress on the record . 
in some of the number the instrumental part have even been record at different time and then later combine on the master tape to produce special_effect . 
some clue to the character of group 's approach in these disc may be gain immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 title include the word `` percussion '' or `` percussive '' . 
drum , xylophone , castanets , and other percussive_instrument are reproduce remarkably well . 
only_too often , however , you have the feeling that you are sit in a room with some of the instrument line_up on one wall to your left and others face them on the wall to your right . 
they be definitely in the same room with you , but your head start to swing as though you were sit on the very edge of a tennis_court watch a spirited volley . 
the percussive twenties ( sp 44006 ) stir pleasant memory with well-known song of that day , and person 's kombo give_forth with tingle jazz in percussive_moods ( sp 44005 ) . 
big_band_percussion ( sp 44002 ) seem one of the least attractive disc - the arrangement just did n't have so much character as the others . 
there be an extraordinary sense of presence in all of these recording , apparently obtain at_least in part by emphasize the middle and high_frequency . 
the penalty for this be noticeable in the big , bold , brilliant , but brassy piano sound in melody_and_percussion_for_two_pianos ( sp 44007 ) . 
all_of the release , however , are record at a gratifyingly high level , with resultant masking of any surface_noise . 
pass_in_review practically guarantee enjoyment , and be a dramatic demonstration of the potentiality of any stereo music system . 
many hollywood film manage somehow to be authentic , but not realistic . 
strange , but true - authenticity and realism often are n't relate at_all . 
almost every film bear the imprimatur of hollywood be physically authentic - in_fact , impeccably so . 
in any given period_piece the costume , bric-a-brac , vehicle , and decor , bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity . 
the major studio maintain a cadre of film librarian and research specialist who look to this matter . 
during the making recently of an important biblical film , some 40 volume of research material and sketch not_only of costume and interior , but of architectural development , sports_arena , vehicle , and other paraphernalia were compile , consult , and comply with . 
but , alas , the authenticity seem to stop at the set 's edge . 
the drama itself - and this seem to be lavishly true of biblical drama - often have hardly any relationship with authenticity at_all . 
the storyline , in sort , be wildly unrealistic . 
thus , in `` the_story_of_ruth '' we have person , person , and person and set that be meticulously authentic . 
but except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline - i.e. , that person remain with person and finally wind_up with person - the film version have little to do with the bible . 
and in the new `` king_of_kings '' the plot involve intrigue and twist and turn that cannot be trace to the gospels . 
earlier this month person , director of the group , come to hollywood and have dinner with more_than 100 leader of the motion_picture industry . 
he talk_about unauthentic storyline too . 
he intimate that they were n't do_good the country much good in the cold_war . 
and to an industry that pride itself on authenticity , he urge great realism . 
`` in many corner of the globe '' , he say , `` the major source of impression about this country be in the movie they meet . 
would we want a future_day person or person recount the saga of america with movie as his prime source of knowledge ? 
yet for much of the globe , hollywood be just that - prime , if_not sole , source of knowledge . 
if a man totally ignorant of america were to judge our land and its civilization base on hollywood alone , what conclusion do you think he might come_to ? 
the group , location , present `` king_of_hearts '' by person and person . 
direct by person ; setting by person . 
the cast : 
person has choose a delightful comedy for his season 's opener at location in person 's `` king_of_hearts '' . 
the dialogue be sharp , witty and candid - typical `` do n't eat the daisy '' material - which has stamp the author throughout her book and play , and it be obvious that the theatre-by-the-sea audience like it . 
the story be of a famous strip cartoonist , an arty individual , whose specialty be the american boy and who adopt a 10 - year old to provide him with fresh idea material . 
this be when his trouble begin , not_to_mention a fledgling artist who he hire , and who turn_out to have idea of his own , with particular respect_to the hero 's sweetheart secretary . 
person , play person , the cartoonist , carries_the_show in marvelous fashion . 
his portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist be virtually flawless . 
this may be unfortunate , perhaps , from the standpoint of person , providence 's contribution to location , who is appear by special arrangement with group . 
not that person does not make the most of his role . 
he does , and more . 
but the book is write around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist , and it has to be that way . 
a word should be say for person , a broadway youngster who , as the adopted son , make life miserable for nearly everybody and person in particular . 
and for his playmate , person of location , who have a bit_part , person . 
on_the_whole , audience will like this performance . 
it be a tremendous book , lively , constantly moving , and the location cast do_well by it . 
the group present `` epitaph_for_george_dillon '' by person and person , direct by person . 
the cast : 
the angry young_man in newport last night be at the group , where `` epitaph_for_george_dillon '' open as the jazz_festival close . 
for the hero of this work by person and person be a chap embitter by more than the lack of beer during a jam_session . 
he 's mad at a world he did not make . 
furthermore , he 's something of a scoundrel , an artist whose mind and feeling be all fingertip . 
this be in contrast to the family with whom he board . 
they not_only think and feel cliche but live cliche as_well . 
it is into this household , one erode by irritation that have torture the soul out of its people , that person enter at the beginning of the play . 
an unsuccessful playwright and actor , he have faith only in himself and in a talent he be not sure exist . 
by the end of the third act , the artist be dead but the body linger on , a shell among other shell . 
not altogether a successful play , `` epitaph_for_george_dillon '' overcome through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling . 
it be awfully talky , for_instance , and not all_of the talk be terribly impressive . 
but it strike spark on_occasion and their light cause all else to be forget . 
there be a fine second act , as an example , one in which person , as person , have an opportunity to blaze_away in one impassioned passage after another . 
this be an exciting young actor to watch . 
just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way be person , whose complete control of her every movement be lovely to watch . 
person be as intensely vibrant as one could wish , almost an icy shriek threaten to explode at any moment . 
also fine be person , as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female spider and just as destructive , person , as her scratchy spouse , and person , as a vegetable in human form . 
person has direct a difficult play here , usually well , but with just a_bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste . 
still , his finale is put_together with taste and a most sensitive projection of that pale sustenance , despair . 
group present `` where's_charley ? '' 
with music and lyric by person , direct by person , choreography by person , musical direction by person . 
the cast : 
everybody fall_in_love with person again last night at the location , and person be to blame . 
one of the finest soft-shoe tune ever invent , `` once_in_love_with_amy '' be also , of_course , one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love_lyric to come_out of american musical_comedy in our era . 
so the audience last night be all ear and eye just after act 2 , get a rousing opening chorus , `` where's_charley ? '' 
, and person sifted_out all alone on the stage with the amble chord and beat of the song just whisper into being . 
it be greatly to person 's credit that he make no attempt to outdo person . 
he drop his earlier and delightful hamming , which be about the only way to handle the old warhorse called `` charley's_aunt '' , and let himself go_with as an appealing an `` person '' as anybody could ask . 
in_brief , person play himself and not person . 
the big audience start applaud even before he had finish . 
the whole production this week be fresh and lively . 
the costume be stunning evocation of the voluminous gown and picture_hat of the gibson_girl day . 
the ballet work be on_the_nose , especially in the opening number by `` group and group '' , along with a fiery and sultry brazilian fantasia later . 
person , whose fame has rest_on in recent year on his skill as a nightclub monologist , prove himself very much at_home in musical_comedy . 
sparrow size person , with sparkling blue eye and a cheerful smile , make a suitably perky person , while person , as the real aunt , be positively monumental in the very best gibson_girl manner . 
all_told , `` where's_charley ? '' ought not to be miss . 
it have a fast pace , excellent music , expert direction , and not_only a good comedian , but an appealing person in his own right , person . 
the group present person 's and person 's production of `` fiorello ! '' 
at location . 
the book be by person and person , music by person , lyric by person , choreography by person , scenery , costume and lighting by person and person , musical direction by person , and the production was direct by person . 
the cast : 
this be one of the happy event of the season . 
the company which perform the pulitzer_prize musical here last night and will repeat it twice today be full of bounce , the politician be in fine voice , the chorine evoke happy memory , and the person ride to break a lance again . 
i see `` fiorello ! '' perform in new_york by the original cast and i think this company be every_bit as good , and perhaps better . 
certainly in the matter of principal there be nothing lacking . 
person may not bear quite as close a physical resemblance to person as person does , but i be amazed at the way he become more_and_more person as the evening progress , until one had to catch_one's_self_up and remember that this be n't really person come_back among us again . 
then person be simply grand as person , the distraught group district chieftain . 
and person , as person , the faithful one who never get home to his person 's dinner , be fine , too . 
as for the lady , they be full of charm , and sincerity , and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving , honest , little man . 
person be excellent as the loyal person , who become the second person , sing and acting with remarkable conviction . 
person , as person , his first wife , manage to make that short role impressive . 
and little person , a person with real spirit and verve , be fascinating whether she was sing of her love for person , the cop who become sewer commissioner and then is promote into garbage , or just dance to display her exuberant feeling . 
such fascinating novelty in the score as the fugal treatment of `` on_the_side_of_the_angels '' and `` politics_and_poker '' were handle splendidly , and i think person and his band of tuneful ward-heeler make `` little_tin_box '' even better than it was do by the new_york cast ; all the words of its clever lyric come_through with perfect clarity . 
the party at person 's penthouse give the `` chorine '' a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed routine which have become a classic choreographic statement of the era 's nonsense . 
person 's multi lingual rally , when he is run for group , be well staged , and wind_up in a wild jewish folk_dance that be really great musical_theater . 
person has establish quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring production . 
not a cut_corners has been visibly cut in this one . 
the set be remarkably elaborate for a road_show that does n't pause long in any one place , and they are devise so_that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness . 
( several time recently i have wonder whether show were being stage for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery being shift right in_front_of their eye . 
i'm glad to say there 's none of that distraction in this `` fiorello ! '' 
) 
it has all been done in superb style , and the result be a show which deserve the support of every person hereabouts who enjoy good musical_theater . 
group present `` where_the_boys_are '' , an group picture produce by person and direct by person from a screenplay by person . 
the cast : 
since the hero , a sterling and upright fellow , be a rich group senior , while two person are cast as virtual rapist , i suppose i should disqualify myself from sit in judgment on `` where_the_boys_are '' , but i shall do nothing of the sort . 
instead - and not just to prove my objectivity - i hasten to report that it 's a highly amusing film which probably do a fairly accurate job of report on the easter vacation shenanigan of collegian down in location , and that it seem to come_to_grips quite honestly with the moral problem that most commonly vex youngster in this age_group - that_is_to_say , sex . 
the answer the girl give strike me as reasonably varied and healthily individual . 
if most_of them be n't exactly specific - well , that 's the way it be in life , i guess . 
but at_least it 's reassuring to see some teenager who do n't profess to know all the answer and are think_about their problem instead . 
`` where_the_boys_are '' also have a juvenile bounce that make_for a refreshing venture in comedy . 
there be some sharp and whipping line and some hilariously funny situation - the best of the latter be a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where a `` mermaid '' is perform . 
most of the female face be new , or at_least not too familiar . 
person , be charming in a leading role , and quite believable . 
i be delighted with person ' comedy performance , which be as fresh and unstilted as one 's highest hope might ask . 
a_couple_of the male make good comedy , too - person and person . 
the only performance which be too soft for me be that of person , but since someone had to become the victim of despoiler , just to emphasize that such thing do happen at these fracas , i suppose this be the attitude the part call_for . 
i must say , however , that i prefer the acting that have something of a biting edge to it . 
to anyone who remember newport at its less_than maximum violence , this view of what the boy and girl do in the springtime before they wing north for the jazz_festival ought to prove entertaining . 
the second feature , `` the_price_of_silence '' , be a british detective_story that will talk_your_head_off . 
as a result , although we still make use of this distinction , there be much confusion as_to the meaning of the basic term employ . 
just what is mean by `` spirit '' and by `` matter '' ? 
the term are generally taken_for_granted as though they refer to direct and axiomatic element in the common experience of all . 
yet in the contemporary context this be precisely what one must_not do . 
for in the modern_world neither `` spirit '' nor `` matter '' refer to any generally agreed_upon element of experience . 
we be in a transitional stage in which many_of the connotation of former usage have had_to be revise or reject . 
when the word are use , we be never sure which of the traditional meaning the user may have_in_mind , or to_what_extent his revision and rejection of former understanding correspond to ours . 
one of the most widespread feature of contemporary thought be the almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit . 
just a_few century ago the world of spirit be as populous and real as the world of material entity . 
not_only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as_well be this true . 
demon , fairy , angel , and a host of other spiritual_being be as much a part of the experiential world of western man as be rock and tree and star . 
in such a world the word `` matter '' and `` spirit '' both refer to directly known reality in the common experience of all . 
in it important element of christianity and of the biblical view of reality in_general , which now cause us much difficulty , could be respond to quite naturally and spontaneously . 
the progress of science over these last few century and the gradual replacement of biblical by scientific category of reality have to a large extent empty the spirit_world of the entity which previously populate it . 
in carry_out this program science has undoubtedly perform a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit . 
the objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly go far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support . 
science be fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arise from an object in space and time . 
when , therefore , it turn its attention to the concrete entity with which popular imagination had people the world of spirit , these entity soon lose whatever status they had enjoy as actual element of external reality . 
in doing so science has unquestionably clear_up widespread misconception , remove extraneous and illusory source of fear , and dispel many undesirable popular superstition . 
there have be , indeed , many important and valuable gain from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful . 
all this has not , however , be an unmixed blessing . 
the scientific debunking of the spirit_world has be in_a_way too successful and too thorough . 
the house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been leave with no means , or at_best with wholly inadequate means , for deal with his experience of spirit . 
although the particular form of conceptualization which popular imagination had make in response to the experience of spirit be undoubtedly defective , the raw experience itself which lead to such excess remain with us as vividly as ever . 
we simply find ourselves in the position of have no means for inquire into the structure and meaning of this range of our experience . 
there be no framework or structure of thought with_respect_to which we can organize it and no part of reality , as we know and apprehend it , with_respect_to which we can refer this experience . 
science has simply leave us helpless and powerless in this important sector of our life . 
the situation in which we find ourselves is bring_out with dramatic force in person 's play the_crucible , which deal with the location witch trial . 
as the play open the audience is introduce to the community of location in puritan america at the end of the eighteenth century . 
aside_from a quaint concern with witch and devil which provide the immediate problem in the opening scene , it be a quite normal community . 
the conversation of the character create an atmosphere suggest the usual mixture of pleasure , foible , irritation , and concern which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age . 
there be no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people . 
instead , the audience can sit_back at_ease and , from the perspective of an enlightened time which no_longer believe_in such thing , enjoy the dead seriousness with which the character in the play take the witch and devil which be under discussion . 
a teenage girl , person , is being sharply question by her minister uncle , the person , about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girl had seemed to have have contact with these evil being . 
for all involved in this discussion the devil be a real entity who can really be confront in the woods on a dark night , the demon world is populated with real creature , and witch actually can be see fly through the air . 
as the play unfold , however , the audience is subtly bring into the grip of an awful evil which grow with ominously gather power and soon engulf the community . 
everyone in location , saint and sinner alike , is sweep_up by it . 
it be like a mysterious epidemic which , start first with person and person , spread inexorably with a dreadfully grow virulence through the whole town until all have been infect by it . 
it grow terribly and unavoidably in power and leave in its wake a trail of misery , moral disintegration , and destruction . 
the audience leave the play under a spell , it be the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active manifestation always evoke . 
if one ask about this play , what it be that come_upon this community and work within it with such terrible power , there be no better answer to give than `` spirit '' . 
this be not to attempt to say what spirit be , but only to employ a commonly use word to designate or simply identify a common experience . 
in_the_end the good man , person , express what the audience has already come to feel when he say , `` a fire , a fire is burn ! 
i hear the boot of lucifer , i see his filthy face '' ! 
the tragic irony of the play be that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be meet in the woods and combat with formula set_out in book be the very thing that prevent them from detect the real devil when he come among them . 
we marvel at their blindness for not see this . 
yet be not we of the mid twentieth century , who rightly do not believe there be any such `` thing '' as the devil , just as bad off as they - only in a different way ? 
in our disbelief we think that we can no_longer even use the word and so be unable to even name the elemental power which be so vividly real in_this play . 
we are leave helpless to cope_with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredit and prove false . 
even person himself seem uncertain on this score . 
in a long commentary which he has insert in the published text of the first act of the play , he say at one point : `` however , that experience never raise a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of lucifer 's many faced lieutenant . 
and his belief be not to his discredit . 
better mind than person 's be - and still be - convinced that there be a society of spirit beyond our ken '' . 
( page 33 ) on_the_other_hand , a_little later_on he say : 
`` since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped_out god 's beard and the devil 's horn , but the world is still grip between two diametrically oppose absolute . 
the concept of unity , in which positive and negative be attribute of the same force , in which good and evil be relative , ever-changing , and always joined to the same phenomenon - such a concept is still reserve to the physical_science and to the few who have grasp the history of idea . 
when we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man 's worthlessness - until redeem - the necessity of the devil may become evident as a weapon , a weapon design and use time_and_time_again in every age to whip man into a surrender to a particular church or church-state '' . 
apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think_of the devil as be actually real . 
yet such_that be the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless leave in the grip of the terrible power and potency of that which come over location . 
it cast a spell upon them so_that they leave with a feeling of having be in the mysterious presence of an evil power . 
it be not enough in account_for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people add together to produce a cumulative effect . 
for this does not account_for the integral , elemental power of that which grow with abounding vigor as the play unfold , nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which come over those who watch the play like a spell . 
the reality of spirit emerge in_this play in_spite_of the author 's conviction to_the_contrary . 
there be nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely know and universally feel than spirit . 
apart from spirit there could be no community , for it be spirit which draw man into community and give to any community its unity , cohesiveness , and permanence . 
think , for_example , of the spirit of the marine_corps . 
surely this be a reality we all acknowledge . 
we cannot , of_course , assign it any substance . 
it be not material and be not a `` thing '' occupy space and time . 
yet it exist and have an objective reality which can be experience and know . 
so it be too with many other spirit which we all know : the spirit of nazism or communism , school spirit , the spirit of a street_corner gang or a football_team , the spirit of group or the ku_klux_klan . 
every community , if it be alive have a spirit , and that spirit be the center of its unity and identity . 
in search for clue which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit , the close connection between spirit and community be likely to prove the most fruitful . 
for it be primarily in community that we know and experience spirit . 
it be spirit which give life to a community and cause it to cohere . 
it be the spirit which be the source of a community 's drawing_power by means of which others are draw into it from the world outside so_that the community grow and prosper . 
yet the spirit which live in community be not identical with the community . 
the idea of community and the idea of spirit be two distinct and separable idea . 
one characteristic of the spirit in community be its givenness . 
the member of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and wait for them . 
it be for them a given which they and they alone possess . 
the spirit of the marine_corps be present and operative before any of the present member of_it come into it . 
it be they , of_course , who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the marine_corps for future recruit to find as they come into it . 
if the content of faith is to be present today in a form that can be `` understand of the people '' - and this , it must_not be forget , be one of the goal of the perennial theological task - there be no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation . 
this does not mean that mythological language as_such can no_longer be use in theology and preaching . 
the absurd notion that demythologization entail the expurgation of all mythological concept completely misrepresent person 's intention . 
his point be not that mythology may_not be use , but that it may no_longer be regard_as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for express the christian kerygma . 
when we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandon , we mean it must be abandon as the sole or proper means for present the christian understanding of existence . 
mythological concept may by_all_means still be use , but they can be use responsibly only as `` symbol '' or `` cipher '' , that_is , only if they are also constantly interpret in non mythological ( or existential ) term . 
the statement is often made that when person argue in this way , he `` overestimate the intellectual stumbling_block which myth be supposed to put in the way of accept the christian faith '' . 
but this statement be completely unconvincing . 
if person 's own definition of myth is strictly adhere to ( and it be interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncement ) , the evidence be overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concept of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant . 
nor be it necessary to look_for such evidence in the great urban_center of our culture that be admittedly almost entirely secularize and so profoundly estranged from the conventional form in which the gospel has been communicate . 
on_the_contrary , even in the heart of `` the bible_belt '' itself , as can be attest by any one who is call to work there , the industrial_revolution and technological_revolution have long be underway , together with the corresponding change in man 's picture of himself and his world . 
in_fact , it be in just such a situation that the profundity of person 's argument is disclose . 
although the theological form of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation , the striking thing be the rapidity with which they are being reduce to a marginal existence . 
this be especially in_evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle_class . 
time_and_again in counseling and teaching , one encounter member of this group whose attempt to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythology of their `` fundamentalist '' heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern_world be only_too painfully obvious . 
the same thing is also evidence by the extreme `` culture protestantism '' so often observe to characterize the preaching and teaching of the american church . 
in the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be express , the unavoidable need to demythologize it make use of whatever resource be at_hand - and this usually mean one or another of the various form of `` folk religion '' current in the situation . 
this be not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with person 's `` cult of reassurance '' or the other type of a purely cultural christianity be the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel . 
but it be to say that this need be far more important for such infatuation than most_of the pundit seem to have suspect . 
however , even if the latent demand for demythologization be not nearly as widespread as we are claim , at_least among the cultured element of the population there tend to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace . 
to_be_sure , when this is point_out , a common response among certain churchman be to fulminate about `` the little flock '' and `` the great crowd '' and to take solace from person 's castigation of the `` wisdom of the wise '' in the opening chapter of first_corinthians . 
but can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indignation ? 
can the church risk assume that the `` folly '' of man be as dear to god as their `` wisdom '' , or , as is also commonly imply , that `` the foolishness of god '' and `` the foolishness of man '' be simply two way of talk_about the same thing ? 
can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gift we so desperately need and apart from whose cooperation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious ? 
there be an ancient and venerable tradition in the church ( which derive , however , from the heritage of the greek rather than from the bible ) that god be completely independent of his creation and so have no need of man for accomplish his work in the world . 
by analogy , the church also has been regard_as entirely independent of the `` world '' in the sense of require nothing from it in_order to be the church . 
but , as scripture everywhere remind us , god does have need of his creature , and the church , a_fortiori , can ill afford to do without the talent with which the world , by god 's providence , present it . 
and yet this be exactly the risk we run when we assume , as we too often do , that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that make it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured man . 
until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened man today can understand , we are deprive ourselves of the very resource on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depend . 
in argue in this way , we are obviously take for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieve ; and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set_forth reason to justify such a conviction . 
but the main point here be that even if such a restatement be not possible , the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable . 
this be what we mean when we say this demand must be accept without condition . 
if to be a christian mean to say yes where i otherwise say no , or where i do not have the right to say anything at_all , then my only choice be to refuse to be a christian . 
express differently : if the price for become a faithful follower of jesus_christ be some form of self-destruction , whether of the body or of the mind - sacrificium corporis , sacrificium intellectus - then there be no alternative but that the price remain unpaid . 
this must be stress because it be absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter . 
modern man , as person has tell us , has `` come_of_age '' ; and though this process by_no_means represent an unambiguous gain and is , in_fact , mark by the estrangement from the depth that seem to be the cost of human maturation , it be still a positive step forward ; and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it . 
in_any_event , it be an irreversible step , and if we be at_all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which god has seen_fit to place us . 
to say this , of_course , be to take_up a position on one side of a controversy go_on now for some two hundred year , or , at_any_rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought . 
we have align ourselves with that `` liberal '' tradition in protestant christianity that count among the great name in its history those of person , person , person , person , and person , and more recently , person and the early person and , in part at_least , person . 
it be to this same tradition that most_of the creative figure in the last century and a half of american theology also belong_to . 
for we must number here not_only the name of person , person , and person , not_to_mention those of `` the group '' and person , but those of the brother person and ( if america may claim him ! ) 
person as_well . 
finally , we may also mention the several member of the self-consciously `` neoliberal '' movement that develop at the group and be heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of person . 
what make this long and diverse tradition essentially one be that those who have belong_to it have be profoundly in_earnest about be modern man in a distinctively modern_world . 
although they have also been concern to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church , they have exhibit no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their christianity . 
they have insist , rather , on live fully and completely within modern culture and , so far from consider this treason to god , have look_upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him . 
when we say , then , that today , in our situation , the demand for demythologization must be accept without condition , we are simply say that at_least this much of the liberal tradition be an enduring achievement . 
however much we may have to criticize liberal theology 's constructive formulation , the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism , not behind it . 
in affirm this we have already take the decisive step in break the deadlock into which person 's attempt to formulate such a theology has lead . 
for we have say , in_effect , that of the two alternative to his position variously represent by the other participant in the demythologize discussion , only one be really an alternative . 
if the demand for demythologization be unavoidable and so must be accept by theology unconditionally , the position of the `` right '' be clearly untenable . 
whereas person 's `` center '' position be structurally inconsistent and be therefore indefensible on formal ground alone , the general position of the `` right '' , as represent , say , by person , involve the rejection or at_least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidate on the material ground we have just consider . 
it follow , then , provided the possibility have been exhaust , that the only real alternative be the general viewpoint of the `` left '' , which has been represent on the continent by person and , to some extent at_least , is find in much that be significant in american and english theology . 
in_order to make the implication of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length . 
we may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other_than the three typically represent by person , person , and person . 
to do this , it be sufficient to point_out that if the principle in_terms_of which alternative are to be conceive be such_as to exclude more_than two , then the question of a `` third '' possibility be a meaningless question . 
thus , if what be at_issue be whether `` all s be p '' , it be indifferent whether `` some s be not p '' or `` no s be p '' , since in either case the judgment in_question be false . 
hence , if what be in_question be whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely reject , it be unimportant whether only a_little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accept ; for , in either event , the first possibility is exclude . 
therefore , the only conceivable alternative be those represent , on_the_one_hand , by the two at_least apparently self-consistent but mutually_exclusive position of person and person and , on_the_other_hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of person . 
a second point require more extended comment . 
it will be recall from the discussion in section 7 that the position of the `` right '' , as represent by person , rest_on the following thesis : the only tenable alternative to person 's position be a theology that ( 1 ) reject or at_least qualify his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation ; ( 2 ) accept instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation ; and ( 3 ) in so doing , free itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event jesus_christ by means of statement that , from person 's point_of_view , be mythological . 
one_hundred year ago there exist in england the group . 
represent as_it_did the effort of only unauthorized individual of the roman_church and anglican_church , and urge a communion of prayer unacceptable to rome , this association produce little fruit , and , in_fact , was condemn by the group in 1864 . 
now again in 1961 , in england , there be perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discuss as christian unity . 
the group , january 18 - 25 , be enthusiastically devote to prayer and discussion by the various church . 
many people seem hopeful , yet it be difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of christian unity in 1961 than there be in 1861 . 
but it must be readily see that the religious picture in england has so greatly change during these hundred year as to engender hope , at_least on the catholic side . 
for `` the_tide_is_well_on_the_turn '' , as the group has write . 
i come to england last summer to do research on the unpublished letter of person . 
as an american catholic of irish ancestry , i come with certain preconception and expectation ; being intellectually influence by person and the general 19th century literature of england , i know only a protestant dominated country . 
since arrive here , however , i have form a far different religious picture of present-day england . 
in represent part of this new picture , i will be recount some of my own personal experience , reaction and judgment ; but my primary aim is to transcribe what englishman themselves are say and write and imply about the roman_church and anglican_church and about the present religious state of england . 
since the protestant clergy for_the_most_part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit , my roman_collar and black garb usually identify me in england as a roman_catholic cleric . 
in_any_case , i have always been treat with the utmost courtesy by englishman , even in location and location , where anti catholic feeling has supposedly exist the strong and long . 
nowhere have i see public expression of anti-catholicism . 
on my first guy_fawkes_day here , i find catholic as well as non catholic celebrate with the traditional firework and bonfire , and was tell that most englishman either do not know or be not concerned with the historical significance of the day . 
a birmingham newspaper print in a column for child an article entitle `` the true story of person '' , which begin : 
`` when you pile your '' guy `` on the bonfire tomorrow night , i wonder how much of the true story of person you will remember ? 
in the 355 year since the first guy_fawkes_night , much of the story has been forget , so here be a reminder '' . 
the article proceed to give an inaccurate account of a catholic plot to kill person , . 
in_spite_of the increase in number and prestige bring_about by the conversion of person and other tractarian of the 1840 's and 1850 's , the catholic segment of england one_hundred year ago be a very small one ( four percent , or 800000 ) which did not enjoy a gracious hearing from the general public . 
the return of the catholic hierarchy in 1850 was look_upon with indignant disapprobation and , in_fact , was charge with be a gesture of disloyalty . 
in 1864 person professedly had to write his apologia with his keen feelings in_order_to be believe and to command a fair hearing from english reader . 
now , in 1961 , the catholic population of england be still quite small ( ten percent , or 5 million ) ; yet it represent a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population . 
a protestant woman marvel to me over the large crowd go_in and go_out of the group ( catholic ) church on sunday morning . 
she find this a marvel because , as she say , only six percent of english_people be churchgoer . 
she may not have be exact on this number , but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less_than ten . 
from many side come remark that protestant church are badly attend and the large medieval cathedral look all_but empty during service . 
a catholic priest recently recount how in the chapel of a large city_university , following anglican evensong , at which there be a congregation of twelve , he celebrate mass before more_than a_hundred . 
the protestant themselves be the first to admit the great falling_off in effective membership in their church . 
according_to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistic of the church_of_england , the `` total of confirmed member be 9748000 , but only 2887671 are register on the parochial church_roll '' , and `` over 27 million person in england are baptize into the church_of_england , but roughly only a tenth of them continue '' . 
an amazing article in the manchester_guardian of last november , entitle `` fate of redundant church '' , state than an archbishop ' commission `` report last month that in the church_of_england alone there be 790 church which be redundant now , or will be in 20 year ' time . 
a further 260 anglican church have been demolish since 1948 '' . 
and in the last five year , the `` methodist chapel committee has authorize the demolition or , more often , the sale of 764 chapel '' . 
most of these former church are now use as warehouse , but `` neither anglican nor nonconformist object to sell church to roman_catholic '' , and have done so . 
while it must be say that these same protestant have build some new church during this period , and that religious population_shift have empty church , a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy be that fewer protestant are go_to church . 
it should be admit , too , that there be a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing catholic ( one paper write 50 percent ) . 
still , it be clear from such report , and apparently clear from the remark of many person , that protestant are decrease and catholic increase . 
an anglican clergyman in oxford sadly but frankly acknowledge to me that this be true . 
a century ago , person see that liberalism ( what we now might call secularism ) would gradually but definitely make its mark on group , and that even high_anglicanism would someday no_longer be a `` serviceable breakwater against doctrinal error more fundamental than its own '' . 
that day be perhaps today , 1961 , and it seem no_longer very meaningful to call england a `` protestant country '' . 
one of the irony of the present crusade for christian unity be that there be not , relatively speak , many real christian to unite . 
many english catholic be proud of their catholicism and know that they be in a new ascendancy . 
the london_universe devote its centenary issue last december 8 to map_out various aspect of catholic progress during the last one_hundred year . 
with traditional nationalistic spirit , some englishman claim that english catholicism be catholicism at its best . 
i have find myself say with other foreigner here that english catholic be good catholic . 
it has been my experience to find as many man as woman in church , and to hear almost everyone in church congregation recite the latin prayer and response at mass . 
they hope , of_course , to reclaim the non-catholic population to the catholic faith , and at every sunday benediction they recite by_heart the `` prayer_for_england '' : 
`` o blessed virgin_mary , mother of god and our most gentle queen and mother , look down in mercy upon england , thy '' dowry `` , and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee . 
intercede for our separated brother , that with us in the one true fold they may be unite to the chief shepherd , the vicar of thy son '' . 
a hymn often to be hear in catholic church be `` faith_of_our_fathers '' , which glory in england 's ancient faith that endure persecution , and which proclaim : 
`` faith of our father : virgin_mary 's prayer / shall win our country back to thee '' . 
the english saint are widely venerate , quite naturally , and now there be great hope that the person and person will soon be canonize . 
because they have keep the faith of their medieval father , english catholic have always strongly resent the charge of be `` english '' . 
i have not see this charge make during my stay here , but apparently it be still in_the_air . 
for_example , a writer in a recent number of the_queen hyperbolically state that `` of the myriad imprecation the only one which the english catholic really resent be the suggestion that they be ' un english '' ' . 
in this connection , it has been observe that the increasing number of irish catholic , priest and laity , in england , while certainly see as good for catholicism , be nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic english catholic , especially when these irishman offer to remind their christian brother of this good . 
one of the more noteworthy change that have take_place since the mid 19th century be the situation of catholic at group and group . 
at group one_hundred year ago there be very few catholic , partly because religious test were remove only in 1854 . 
moreover , for those few there be almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious need . 
now , not_only are there considerably more laity as student and professor at group , but there be also numerous house of religious_order exist in respectable and friendly relations with the non-catholic member of the university . 
some catholic priest lecture there ; catholic seminarian attend tutorial and row on the location with non-catholic student . 
further evidence that roman_catholicism enjoy a more favorable_position today than in 1861 be the respectful attention give to_it in the mass_media of england . 
the general tone of article appear in such important newspaper as the manchester_guardian and the sunday_observer imply a kindly recognition that the catholic_church be now at_least of equal stature in england with the protestant church . 
on successive sunday during october , 1960 , person ( a non-catholic ) write article in the group depict clergyman of the church_of_england , the group and the group . 
the catholic priest , though somewhat superficially draw , easily come_out the best . 
there be many letter of strong protest against the portrait of the anglican clergyman , who was indeed portray as a man not particularly concerned with religious matter and without really very_much to do as clergyman . 
such a series of article was certainly never print in the public_press of mid victorian england . 
there be so much interest show in this present-day venture that it was continue on group , where comment were equally make by an anglican parson , a group minister and a catholic priest . 
catholic priest have frequently appear on television_program , sometimes discuss the christian faith on an equal footing with protestant clergyman . 
a notable example of this be the discussion of christian unity by the catholic archbishop of liverpool , person , and the anglican archbishop of location , person , recently appointed archbishop of location . 
the good feeling which exist between these two important church figure be now well_known in england . 
the holy_sacrament of the mass with commentary has been televise several time in recent month . 
and it be interesting to observe that group . 's television film on christmas_eve be the_bells_of_st._mary's . 
of_course , the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern of english religious history be the friendly visit pay by person , then anglican archbishop of location , to the vatican last december . 
it be the first time an english primate has do this since the 14th century . 
english catholic react to this event with moderate but real hope . 
almost daily something is report which feed this catholic hope in england : statistic of the increasing number of convert and irish catholic immigrant ; news of a protestant minister in location who has offer to allow a catholic priest to preach from his pulpit ; a report that a catholic nun had been request to teach in a non-catholic secondary_school during the sickness of one of its master ; the startling statement in a respectable periodical that `` catholic , if the present system be still in_operation , will constitute almost one-third of the group in the next generation '' ; a report that 200 protestant clergyman and laity attend a votive mass offer for christian unity at a catholic_church in location during the church unity octave . 
the death of a man be unique , and yet it be universal . 
the straight_line would symbolize its uniqueness , the circle its universality . 
but how can one figure symbolize both ? 
christianity declare that in the life and death of jesus_christ the unique and the universal concur . 
perhaps no church_father see this concurrence of the unique and the universal as clearly , or formulate it as precisely , as person . 
to be the savior and the lord , jesus_christ has to be a historical individual with a biography all his own ; he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoop to earth for_a_while but never identify itself with man 's history . 
yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind . 
his history be his alone , yet each man must recognize his own history in it . 
his death be his alone , yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of jesus . 
each man can identify himself with the history and the death of jesus_christ because jesus_christ has identify himself with human history and human_death , come as the head of a new humanity . 
not a circle , then , nor a straight_line , but a spiral represent the shape of death as person see it ; for a spiral have motion as_well_as recurrence . 
as represent by a spiral , history may , in_some_sense , be say to repeat itself ; yet each historical event remain unique . 
christ be both unique and universal . 
the first turn of the spiral be the primeval history of humanity in adam . 
as person interpret the end of history on the basis of its beginning , so person portray the story of adam on the basis of the story of christ . 
`` whence , then , come the substance of the first man ? 
from god 's will and wisdom , and from virgin earth . 
for ' god had not rained ' , say the scripture , before man was make , ' and there be no man to till the earth ' . 
from this earth , then , while it be still virgin god take dust and fashion the man , the beginning of humanity '' . 
person does not regard adam and eve merely as private individual , but as universal human_being , who be and be all_of humanity . 
adam and eve be perfect , not in the sense that they possess perfection , but in the sense that they be capable of development toward perfection . 
they be , in_fact , child . 
person does not claim preexistence for the human soul ; therefore there be no need for him , as there be for person , to identify existence itself with the fall . 
existence is create and will by god and be not the consequence of a preexistent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity into history . 
historical existence be a create good . 
the biblical symbol for this affirmation is express in the word : `` so god create man in his own image ; in the similitude of god he create him '' . 
there be some passage in the writings of person where the image of god and the similitude are sharply distinguish , so most notably in the statement : `` if the [ holy_spirit ] spirit be absent from the soul , such a man be indeed of an animal nature ; and , being leave carnal , he will be an imperfect being , possess the image [ of god ] in his formation , but not receive the similitude [ of god ] through the holy_spirit '' . 
thus the image of god be that which make a man a man and not an oyster ; the similitude of god , by contrast , be that which make a man a child of god and not merely a rational creature . 
recent research on person , however , make it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction . 
he does not mean to say that adam lose the similitude of god and his immortality through the fall ; for he was create not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as_well_as of mortality . 
therefore person describe man 's creation as_follows : 
`` so_that the man should not have thought of grandeur , and become lift_up , as if he have no lord , because of the dominion that had been give to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against god his creator , overstep his bounds , and take_up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards god , a law was give him by god , that he might know that he have for lord the lord of all . 
and he lay_down for him certain condition : so_that , if he keep the command of god , then he would always remain as he be , that_is , immortal ; but if he did not , he would become mortal , melt into earth , whence his frame had been take '' . 
these condition man did not keep , and thus he become mortal ; yet he did not stop be human as a result . 
there be no justification for systematize the random statement of person about the image of god beyond this , nor for read into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of god ( humanity ) and the similitude of god ( immortality ) . 
man was create with the capacity for immortality , but the devil 's promise of immortality in exchange for disobedience cost adam his immortality . 
he was , in the words of person , `` beguile by another under the pretext of immortality '' . 
the true way to immortality lie through obedience , but man did not believe this . 
`` eve be disobedient ; for she did not obey when as_yet she be a virgin . 
and even as she , have indeed a husband , adam , but be nevertheless as_yet a virgin , having become disobedient , was make the cause of death , both to herself and to the entire human_race ; so also did mary , have a man betrothed [ to her ] , and be nevertheless a virgin , by yield obedience , become the cause of salvation , both to herself and the whole human_race '' . 
because he interpret the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believe that adam and eve were create as child , person often seem inclined to extenuate their disobedience as be `` due_to , no_doubt , to carelessness , but still wicked '' . 
his interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompt him to draw these parallel between the virgin eve and the virgin mary . 
that parallelism affect his picture of man 's disobedience too ; for as it be christ , the word_of_god , who come to rescue man , so it be disobedience to the word_of_god in_the_beginning that bring death into the world , and all our woe . 
with this act of disobedience , and not with the inception of his individual existence , man begin the downward circuit on the spiral of history , descend from the create capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality . 
at the nadir of that circuit be death . 
`` along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death , because they did eat in disobedience ; and disobedience to god entail death . 
wherefore , as they become forfeit to death , from that [ moment ] they were hand_over to it '' . 
this lead person to the somewhat startling notion that adam and eve die on the same day that they disobey , namely , on a friday , as a parallel to the death of christ on good_friday ; he see a parallel also to the jewish day of preparation for the sabbath . 
in_any_case , though they had been promise immortality if they eat of the tree , they obtain mortality instead . 
the wages of sin be death . 
man 's life , originally shape for immortality and for communion with god , must now be conform_to the shape of death . 
nevertheless , even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belong to god , and he still rule . 
even death , therefore , have a providential as_well_as a punitive function . 
`` wherefore also he [ god ] drive_out him [ man ] out of paradise , and remove him far from the tree of life , not because he envy him the tree of life , as some venture to assert , but because he pity him , [ and did not desire ] that he should continue a sinner for ever , nor that the sin which surround him should be immortal , and evil interminable and irremediable . 
but he set a bound to his [ state of ] sin , by interpose death , and thus cause sin to cease , putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh , which should take_place in the earth , so_that man , cease at_length to live in sin , and die to it , might live to god '' . 
this idea , which occur in both person and person , fit especially well into the scheme of person ' theology ; for it prepare the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieve in christ . 
as man can live only by die , so it be only by his die that christ could bring many to life . 
it be probably fair to say that the idea of death be more profound in person than the idea of sin be . 
this apply to his picture of adam . 
it is bear_out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin pass from one generation to the next . 
it become most evident in his description of christ as the second adam , who does indeed come to destroy sin , but whose work culminate in the achievement of immortality . 
this emphasis upon death rather than sin as man 's fundamental problem person share with many early theologian , especially the greek speak ones . 
they speak of the work of christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility , which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) deliverance from time and history . 
death remind man of his sin , but it remind him also of his transience . 
it represent a punishment that he know he deserve , but it also symbolize most dramatically that he live his life within the process of time . 
these two aspect of death cannot be successfully separate , but they dare not be confuse or identify . 
the repeated effort in christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspect of death cannot be separate . 
such effort almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether adam was create capable of grow old and_then old and_then still older , in_short , whether adam 's life was intend to be part of the process of time . 
if it was , then it must have be god 's intention to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity . 
one night , so some of these theory run , adam would have fall_asleep , much_as he fall_asleep for the creation of eve ; and thus he would have been carry_over into the life_eternal . 
the embarrassment of these theory over the naturalness of death be an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment , for some termination seem necessary in a life that is live within the natural_order of time and change . 
on_the_other_hand , christian faith know that death be more than the natural termination of temporal existence . 
it be the wages of sin , and its sting be the law . 
if this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguish from the idea of death as natural termination , the conclusion seem inevitable that temporal existence itself be a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the creator . 
this seem to have be the conclusion to which person was force . 
if death receive more_than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receive less_than its share , the gift of the life_eternal through christ begin to look_like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i.e. , created , existence . 
such an interpretation of death radically alter the christian view of creation ; for it teach salvation from , not salvation in , time and history . 
because christianity teach not_only salvation in history , but salvation by the history of christ , such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the christian understanding of the work of christ . 
too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly either because his parent do n't want sonny_boy to `` lift all those old barbell thing '' because `` you 'll stunt your growth '' or because childish taunt from his schoolmate , like `` hey , lookit person , whaddya gonna do with all those muscle ( of which he have none at the time ) '' ? 
after_all , a guy 's gotta have a_little ego ! 
therefore it 's a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in_secret ; has never hear one unkind word from his parent ; and never has been taunt by his schoolmate ! 
this happy , always smile lad with the sunny disposition be our new person - person . 
far from discourage person , his parent urge him on to great and great accomplishment . 
instead of admonish him to let the weight alone they personally take him to that master montreal bodybuilding authority , person . 
and they could n't have entrust person to better hands because `` le_professeur '' know his muscle from the sternocleido_mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis_anticus of the leg - and better still , he know just what exercise work best for them and what person principle to combine them with for fast , fast muscle growth . 
that 's because the good professor teach only person method at his famous group which be located at 1821 location in montreal . 
undoubtedly you have read the case_history of some of his prizewinning pupil ( every pupil have a physique title of some kind or other ) . 
there 's person who be our new person ; person , whose story appear here two issue ago ; person , who be with us last month ; person , who recently win the `` most muscular man '' subdivision award in the person event ; and a host of others . 
yesiree , the professor know his muscle ! 
now when person be just 12 he be only 4 ' 10 '' tall and weigh an astounding 72 pound , and his greatest desire was to pack_on some weight . 
about that time he begin read person and person and he learn of the famous person way to fast weight_gaining . 
see so many illustration and read so many testimonial to the value of quick-wate and super-protein , those two wonderworking person food supplement , he decide to try them and see what they could do for him . 
well , sir , they do real great ! 
for in almost less time than it take to tell it , person 's body weight was increase rapidly . 
of_course he do some exercising - he 's crazy about water-skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in_conjunction_with the added food supplement pack_on pound of solid muscle on his skinny frame . 
person has always have shapely leg from swim and water_ski and really does n't have to work them very_much . 
but he be totally dissatisfied with his upper body . 
it be muscular but it be n't symmetrical . 
`` a real ' nothing ' torso '' , say person . 
`` it never seem to widen , it just get long and long '' . 
that 's when he go_to person . 
and at_once person see what the trouble be and he know just how to correct it . 
in his gym the professor have some of the most `` knocked_out '' equipment since person . 
person be a specialist in torso development and he has long favor the now famous weider_push-pull_super-set technique in which one exercise of the super-set be a pressing or `` pushing '' movement which accent one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , follow by a `` pulling '' exercise which work the opposing sector of the same muscle group . 
so right_away person introduce person to his famous `` moon '' bench and proceed to teach him his first push-pull_super-set consist_of the wide grip straight-arm_pullover ( the `` pull '' part of the push-pull_super-set ) which dramatically widen the rib_cage and strongly affect the muscle of the upper back and chest , and the collar-to-collar bench_press which specifically work_on the chest to build those wide , person `` gladiator '' pecs , while stimulate the upper lat and frontal deltoid . 
as you can see , in this push-pull_super_set the entire chest back shoulder area is vigorously exercise in alternate sector by alternate exercise , so the complete torso remain pumped-up all_the_time ! 
now when person has complete four complete push-pull_super-sets no. 1 , the professor allow him about a five minute rest period before start him on four complete push-pull_super-sets no. 2 . 
super-set no. 2 is make_up of similar exercise , but this time done with dumbbell , and use both `` moon '' and flat_bench . 
the `` push '' exercise of this push-pull_super-set be the bench_press done with elbow well pulled back and with a great downward stretch of the pectoral not possible with the barbell variation . 
you need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs . 
the dumbbell variation develop a most classically sculpture outline to the pecs . 
the `` pull '' exercise in this super-set be the one dumbbell bent-arm_pullover . 
( note how strongly the upper lat and serratus are work in this fine exercise because of the pinpoint concentration of force which the dumbbell variation afford ) . 
in the third push-pull_super-set the `` push '' exercise be the wide grip pushup_between_bars , while the `` pull '' exercise be the moon_bench_lateral_raise with bent arm . 
the pushup done in this manner be the greatest pectoral rib_cage stretch ever invent ! 
this be true only if a very wide grip is use and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieve . 
you 'll know when you 've made the greatest stretch because your shoulder_blade will touch ! 
as you see , the professor has design a piece of apparatus that force the bodybuilder to use a wide grip . 
he has to ; he just can n't do anything about it at_all ! 
but as you can also see , it 's not a painful exercise at_all , because person - the `` happy '' bodybuilder - look as though he were have the time of his life ! 
the last exercise of person 's prescribed program for person be a single exercise , done in individual set with a_bit long pause between set . 
by this time person 's entire chest back - lat shoulder area be pumped-up to almost burst point , and person take time to do a_bit more pectoral front deltoid shaping work . 
he have person do from four to six set of the incline_bench_press ( note the high incline ) . 
this give a wide flare to the pecs , cause them to flow dramatically upward into deltoid and dramatically downward into the serratus and lat . 
this be the kind of chest that invariably win contest that steel edged `` carved out_of solid rock '' look of the great champion . 
so with four complete push-pull_super-sets no. 1 , four of no. 2 , four of no. 3 and four to six set of the incline_bench_press , you can see that person has have a terrific mass build , muscle shape , torso defining workout that cannot be improve upon . 
physique contest are rarely win on muscle size alone . 
rare still be a mr._america or mr._universe of true herculean build . 
the aspect of physical development that catch the judge ' eye and which rightfully influence their decision be symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion - superior definition of the muscle . 
now good definition be one thing that all_of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light weight workout . 
but contest definition - that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seem as though it must have been carve by a sculptor 's chisel - be something quite different . 
this come not alone from high-set , high-rep training , but from certain definition specialization exercise which the champion select for himself with the knowledge of exactly what work best for him . 
often these exercise work well for some bodybuilder but less spectacularly for others . 
because they be `` minority '' exercise and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten . 
only when the new mr._america or mr._universe rediscover them and put them into practice are we reacquaint with them and once_again see how effective they really be . 
the exercise i shall discuss in this - the first of a new series of article on muscle definition specialization of a particular body_part - be the one_leg_lunge . 
why it was ever forget for even a moment i cannot say because it work perfectly for everyone , no_matter whether he have short or long thighbone length ! 
it be the one exercise that drastically influence the definition of the thigh at the hipline - that mark of the champion that set him apart from all other bodybuilder - a criterion of muscle `` drama '' that_is unforgettable to judge and audience alike - the facet of muscular development that win prize . 
definition of the thigh at the uppermost part is quite commonly see in most championship olympic lifter which be easily understandable . 
the one_leg_lunge be a split and all lifter practice this in their regular workout . 
but for purely definition purpose - use in conjunction with your regular squatting , leg_curling , leg_extensor program - a heavy weight is not needed . 
indeed , a light weight work much better because a greater , more extensive split can be_performed . 
use in several set of high reps once or twice each_week it will not be long before your entire upper leg take_on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscle look_like wire cable writhe and twist under the skin ! 
really there be no reason why this fine exercise should not find_its_way into your leg program at all time , for the following suggestion show why it be so effective : 
it 's a complete thigh contraction extension exercise . 
it place terrific tension on the leg muscle from_start_to_finish of each repetition . 
it improve overall balance and control for the bodybuilder , and help to make squat more easily and more correctly perform . 
it increase flexibility of the leg . 
it speed muscle growth and power development even for the advanced bodybuilder because each hip and leg is exercise separately , thus enable a massive , concentrated effort to be focus_on each . 
you 'll need your weider_power_stands for this fine exercise and here 's the way it 's do : 
place your power_stands in position and adjust their height so_that this will correspond to the height of your shoulder when you be in a deep leg split as for a heavy clean . 
place a suitably loaded barbell across them ; grasp the bar ( which will rest against the back of your neck ) ; extend your foot forward and backward until you be in a deep leg split . 
now raise the weight by straighten your front leg , without move your foot . 
when the front knee be straight and lock , allow it to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the side of the power_stands . 
after you have take_a_breather , reverse the position of your leg so_that the front thigh of the previous exercise be now to the rear , and the rear thigh now to the front , and perform the same movement in the same manner . 
that 's the one-leg_lunge in_a_nutshell . 
you should have a_couple_of training partner to stand_by when you make your first experiment , just for safety . 
you should also begin this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed to it balance_wise . 
oh , you 'll wobble and weave quite a_bit at_first . 
but do n't worry . 
before your first training experiment has end there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it you 'll be raise and lower yourself just like a veteran ! 
although i suggest that you hold the bar at the back of the neck there 's no reason why you should n't make some experiment with the bar hold in_front_of the neck . 
squat_style lifter and leg split lifter would both benefit enormously by practice those variation providing that they remember to make alternate set with the left and right leg to the front . 
the most beautiful bed of pansy i 've see be in a south_dakota yard on a sizzling day . 
pansy be supposed to like it cool , but those great velvety flower be healthy and perky in the glaring sun . 
i seek_out the gardener and ask him what he do to produce such beauty in that weather . 
he seem puzzle by my question . 
`` i just love them '' , he say . 
the more i talk with him , the more convinced i become that that be the secret of their riotous blooming . 
of_course his love was express in intelligent care . 
he plant the pansy seed himself , buy them from a pansy specialist . 
these specialist , i learn , have do a great_deal of work to improve the size and health of the plant and the resulting flower . 
their seed produce vigorous blooming plant half again the size of the unimproved strain . 
i ask him if he take seed from his own plant . 
occasionally , when he have an unusual flower that he want more of he did ; but pansy seed , he tell me , soon `` run_down '' . 
it be best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is work to improve them . 
his soil be `` nothing special '' , just prairie land , but he had harrow in compost until it be loose , spongy and brown black . 
i finger it and have the feeling of adequacy that come_with the right texture , tilth and body . 
it be n't easy to describe it , but every gardener know it when his finger touch such soil . 
nothing be easy to grow from seed than pansy . 
they germinate quickly , the tiny plant appear in a week , and grow along lustily . 
it does n't really matter which month of the year you sow them , but they germinate best when they have a wide variation of temperature , very warm follow by cool in the same 24 hour . 
i like to make a seedbed right in the open , though many people start them successfully in cold_frame . 
pansy do n't have to be coddle ; they 'd rather have thing rugged , with only moderate protection on the cold day . 
if you do use a cold_frame be sure that its ventilation be adequate . 
for my seedbed i use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage rooting . 
i dig it , rake it smooth , sow the seed and wet them down with a fog spray . 
then i cover the sow with a board . 
this keep it cool and moist and protect it from bird . 
ant carry_away the seed so better be sure that there be no ant hill nearby . 
when the first sprinkling of green appear i remove the board . 
a light , porous mulch apply now keep the root cool and the soil soft during these early day of growth . 
i like sawdust for this , or hay . 
when they have 4 to 6 leaf and be thrifty little plant , it be time to set them out where they are to remain . 
every time you transplant a pansy you cause its flower to become smaller . 
the moral be : do n't transplant it any oftener than you must . 
as_soon_as they be large enough to move , i put mine 9 inch apart where they are to bloom . 
i put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed bonemeal into each hole with the plant . 
that encourage rooting , and the better developed the root , the large and more plentiful the flower . 
pansy be glutton . 
i doubt if it be possible to overfeed them . 
i spade lot of compost into their bed ; lack that , decayed manure spread_over the bed be fine . 
one year i simply set the plant in the remains of a compost pile , to which a_little sand had been add , and i have the most beautiful pansy in my , or any of my neighbor ' experience . 
in_addition to the rich soil they benefit by feeding of manure water every_other week , dilute to the color of weak tea . 
as a substitute for this , organic fertilizer dissolve in water to half the strength in the direction , may be use . 
they need mulch . 
we put a light mulch over the seedling ; now we must use a heavy one . 
three inch of porous material will do a good job of keep weed down and the soil moist and cool . 
when winter come be ready with additional mulch . 
i like hay for this and apply it so_that only the top of the plant show right after a good frost . 
that keep_in the cold , retain moisture and prevent the heave of alternate freezing and thawing . 
do n't miss the pansy that appear from_time_to_time through the winter . 
whenever there be a thaw or a_few sunny day , you 'll be likely to find a brave little blossom or two . 
if those be n't enough for you , why not grow some just for winter blooming ? 
the pansy i cherish most bloom for me in february during a particularly cold winter . 
i start the seed in a flat in june and set_out the little pansy in a cold_frame . 
( an unheated greenhouse would have be better , if i had have one . ) 
the plant take zero night in_stride their stride , with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass to protect them . 
in response to the lengthening day of february they bud , then bloom their 4 - inch velvety flower . 
that cold_frame be my morale_builder ; its mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow make my spirit rise every time i look at it . 
like strawberry in december , pansy be far more exciting in february than in may . 
try that late winter pickup when you be so tired_of cold and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it . 
the day will come , in midsummer , when you find your plant become `` leggy '' , run to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossom . 
try peg_down each separate branch to the earth , use a bobby_pin to hold it there . 
pick the flower , keep the soil dampen , and each of the pegged-down branch will take root and become a little plant and go_on bloom for the rest of the season . 
as_soon_as an experimental tug assure you that root have taken_over , cut_off it off from the mother plant . 
a second and also good practice be to shear off the top , leave an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each branch . 
these cut_down plant will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring . 
i like to shear half my plant at_a_time , leave one half of them to blossom while the second_half is get_started on its new round of blooming . 
probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom be to let the blossom go to seed . 
nature 's aim , different from ours , be to provide for the coming generation . 
that done , her work be accomplished and she ignore the plant . 
here be a word_of_advice when you go shopping for your pansy seed . 
go_to a reputable grower , preferably a pansy specialist . 
it be no hard to raise big , healthy , blooming plant than weak , sickly little thing ; in_fact it be easy . 
but you will never get better flower than the seed you grow . 
many people think that pansy last only a_few week , then their period of growth and bloom be over . 
that be not true . 
if the plant are care for and protect over the winter , the second year be more prolific than the first . 
would you like to grow exhibition pansy ? 
remove about half the branch from each plant , leave only the strong with the largest bud . 
the flower will be huge . 
pansy have character . 
they stick_to their principle , insist upon their due , but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if give it . 
treat them right and they 'll make a showing every_month in the year except the frigid ones . 
give them food , some shade , mulch , water and more food , and they 'll repay your solicitude with beauty . 
a salad with greens and tomato be a popular and wonderfully healthful addition to a meal , but add an avocado and you have something really special . 
this delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past thirty year because modern transportation method have make it possible to ship avocado anywhere in the united_states . 
it have a great many asset to recommend it and if you have n't make avocado a part of your diet yet , you really should . 
you will find that avocado be unlike any other fruit you have ever taste . 
it be roughly shape like a large pear , and when properly ripen , its dark green skin cover a meaty , melon like pulp that have about the consistency of a ripe bartlett_pear , but oily . 
the avocado should have a `` give '' to it , as you hold it , when it be ripe . 
the flavor be neither sweet , like a pear , nor tart like an orange ; it be subtle and rather bland , nut like . 
it be a flavor that might take a_little get used_to - not because it be unpleasant , but because the flavor be hard to define in the light of our experience with other fruit . 
sometimes it take several `` eating '' of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste that has make it such a favorite throughout the world . 
once you become an avocado fan , you will look_forward to the season each_year with eager anticipation . 
today , refrigerated carrier have make the shipping of avocado possible to any place in the world . 
the fruit is allow to mature on the tree , but it be still firm at this point . 
it is bring to packinghouse , clean and grade as to size and quality , and pack in protective excelsior . 
the fruit is then cool to 42 ` f , a temperature at which it lapse into a sort_of dormant state . 
this cooling does not change the avocado in any way , it just delay the natural softening of the fruit until a grove like temperature ( room_temperature ) is restore . 
this happen on the grocer 's shelf or in your kitchen . 
one of the most attractive thing about avocado be that they do not require process of any kind . 
there be no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed . 
if the temperature is control properly , the avocado will delay its ripening until need . 
and unlike other fruit , one cannot eat the skin of the avocado . 
it be thick , much like an eggplant 's skin , so that poison spray , if they are use , present no hazard to the consumer . 
good taste and versatility , plus safety from spray poison would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit , even if its nutritional value be limited . 
avocado , however , be very rich_in nutrient . 
their main asset be an abundance of unsaturated fatty_acid , so necessary for maintain the good_health of the circulatory_system . 
aside from this , the average portion contain some protein , an appreciable amount of vitamin and vitamin_c - about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement , and about a third of the official vitamin_e requirement . 
the b_vitamin are well represent , especially thiamin and riboflavin . 
calcium , phosphorus and iron be present in worthwhile amount , and eleven other mineral also have been find in vary trace amount . 
none of these value is destroy , not significantly alter by refrigeration storage . 
person , of the group , location , florida , and the location , set_out to discover if avocado , because of their high content of unsaturated fatty_acid , would reduce the cholesterol of the blood in select patient . 
the study comprise 16 male patient , range in age from 27 to 72 . 
they were put on control diet to determine as accurately as possible , the normal cholesterol level of their blood . 
then they were give 12 to 1 - 12 avocado per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption . 
the lyric beauty of person 's trout_quintet - its elemental rhythm and infectious melody - make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listener . 
but for student of musical form and would-be classifier , the work present its problem . 
since it require only five player , it would seem to fall_into the category of chamber_music - yet it call_for a double_bass , an instrument generally regard_as symphonic . 
moreover , the piece is write in five movement , rather_than the conventional four of most quintet , and this give the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor . 
the many and frequent performance of the trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing . 
some rendition be of symphonic dimension , with the contrabass give free_rein . 
other interpretation present the music as an essentially intimate creation . 
in these reading , the double_bass is either keep discreetly in the background , or it is dress in clown 's attire - the musical equivalent of a bull_in_a_china_shop . 
recently i was strike anew by the divergent approach , when in the course of one afternoon and evening i listen to no fewer than ten different performance . 
the occasion for this marathon : group 's long awaited reissue in its `` great_recordings_of_the_century '' series of the schnabel-pro_arte version . 
let me say at the outset that the music sound as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first . 
whether consider alone or in_relation_to other edition , colh 40 be a document of prime importance . 
person be one of the greatest person player of_all_time , and any commentary of his on this repertory be valuable . 
but person be a great teacher in_addition_to be a great performer , and the fact that four of the ten version i listen to be by person pupil ( person , person , person , and person ) also shed_light_on the master 's pedagogical skill . 
certain pianistic trait be common to all five person rendition , most notably the `` person trill '' ( which differ from the conventional trill in_that the two note are strike simultaneously ) . 
but the most impressive testimony to person 's distinction as a teacher is reflect by the individuality which mark each student 's approach as distinctly his own . 
person 's emphasis on structural clarity , his innate rhythmic vibrancy , and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one . 
yet no detail be too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here have humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity . 
this be a serious minded interpretation , but it be never straitlaced . 
and although person 's pianism bristle with excitement , it be meticulously faithful to person 's dynamic marking and phrase indication . 
the piano performance on this person be one that really demand a search for superlative . 
about the group 's contribution i be less happy . 
i , for one , rather regret that person did n't collaborate with the group , whose rugged , athletic playing be a good_deal close to this pianist 's interpretative outlook than the style of the belgian group . 
from a technical standpoint , the string playing be good , but the group people fail to enter into the spirit of thing here . 
the violinist , in particular , be very indulgent with swoop and slide , and his tone be pinched and edgy . 
the twenty-five year old recording offer rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instrument be good and the transfer be very quiet . 
there be a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` forellen '' movement , and i suspect that this be_due to imperfect splicing between side of the original sps . 
turn_to the more modern version , person 's ( london ) offer the most sophisticated keyboard work . 
every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully think_out , and of these i would especially cite the delicious landler touch the pianist bring to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is play with viennese musician ) , and the gossamer shade throughout . 
some of person 's playing strike me as finicky , however . 
why , for_example , does he favor two tempo , rather than one , for the third movement ? 
the assist musician from the group be somewhat lacking in expertise , but their contribution be rustic and appealing . 
( special compliment to the double_bass playing of person : 
his scrawny , tottering sound add a delightful hilarity to the performance . ) 
the glazer-fine_arts edition ( concert-disc ) be a model of lucidity and organization . 
it be , moreover , a perfectly integrated ensemble effort . 
but having live with the disc for some time now , i find the performance less exciting than either person 's or person 's ( whose superb performance with the group has still to be record ) and a good_deal less filled with humor than person 's . 
person 's work be very_much akin to person 's , but the sound on his decca disc be dated , and you will have a hard_time locate a copy of it . 
the group ( group ) and group ( group ) edition give us superlative string playing ( both in symphonic style ) cripple by unimaginative piano playing . 
( person has acquire some of person 's keyboard manner , but his playing be of limited insight . ) 
badura-skoda-vienna_konzerthaus ( group ) and group ( group ) be both warm-toned , pleasantly lyrical , but rather slack and tensionless . 
person , play with a group of musician from the group , give a sturdy reading , in much the same vein as that of the last_mentioned pianist . 
group has accord him beautiful sound , and this bargain-priced disc ( it sell for $ 2.98 ) be worthy of consideration . 
return once_again to the person reissue , i am beguile anew by the magnificence of this pianist 's musical penetration . 
here be truly a `` great recording of the century '' , and its greatness is by_no_means diminish by the fact that it be not quite perfect . 
this recording surely belong in everyone 's collection . 
must record always sound like record ? 
from the beginning of commercial recording , new disc purport to be indistinguishable from the real_thing have regularly been put in circulation . 
see in perspective , many_of these release have a genuine claim to be milestone . 
although lacking absolute verisimilitude , they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary material for re-creation of the original . 
on the basis of what they give us we can know how the young person sing , appreciate the distinctive quality of person under person 's baton , or sense the type of ensemble person create in his year with the group . 
since the concept of high_fidelity become important some dozen year ago , the claim of technical improvement have multiply tenfold . 
in many case the revolutionary production has offer no more than sensational effect : 
the first hearing be fascinating and the second disillusioning as the gap between sound and substance become clear . 
other innovation with better claim to musical interest survive rehearing to acquire in_time the status of classic . 
if we return to them today , we have no difficulty spot their weakness but we find them still pleasing . 
record sound like record because they provide a different sort of experience than live music . 
this difference is make_up of many factor . 
some of them be obvious , such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our response and behavior in different type of environment and social setting . 
( music often sound best to me when i can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat . ) 
from the technical standpoint , record differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color , texture , complexity , range , intensity , pulse , and pitch of the original . 
any alteration of one of these factor is distortion , although we generally use that word only for effect so pronounced that they can be state quantitatively on the basis of standard test . 
yet it is the accumulation of distortion , the fit together of fractional bit until the total reach the threshold of our awareness , that make record sound like record . 
the sound may be good ; but if you know the real_thing , you know that what you are hear be only a clever imitation . 
group 's new person second be a major effort to make a record that sound like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one . 
like the recent scheherazade from group ( high_fidelity , sept 1961 ) , it be successful because emphasis has been place on good musical and engineering practice rather_than on create sensational effect . 
because of this , only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineer ' triumph . 
the easy way to describe this release is to say that it reproduce an interesting and effective person performance with minimal alteration of its musical value . 
the engineering as_such never obtrude_upon your consciousness . 
the effect of the recording be very open and natural , with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance . 
this absence of peaky high and beefed-up bass not_only produce greater fidelity , but it eliminate listener fatigue . 
a contributing factor be the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintain . 
the orchestra be far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrape , valve click , and other noise incidental_to playing . 
yet you feel the orchestra be near at_hand , and the individual instrument have the same firm presence associate with listen from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall . 
group has achieve the ideal amount of reverberation . 
the music is always allow the living_space needed to attain its full sonority ; yet the hall never intrude as a quasi performer . 
the timbre remain that of the instrument unclouded by resonance . 
all_of this would be wasted , of_course , if the performance lack authority and musical distinction . 
for me it have more of both element than the majority of its competitor . 
person seem to have go_back directly back to the score , discount tradition , and has build his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly what person set_down on_paper . 
those accustomed to broad , more romantic statement of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one . 
without lose the distinctive undertow of brahmsian rhythm , the pacing be firm and the overall performance have a tightly_knit quality that make_for maximum cumulative effect . 
the presto ma_non_assai of the first trio of the scherzo is take literally and may shock you , as the real allegro_con_spirito of the finale be likely to bring you to your foot . 
in_the_end , however , the thing about this performance that is most striking be the way it sings . 
person obviously has conclude that it be the lyric element which must dominate in this score , and he manage at_times to create the effect of the whole orchestra burst into song . 
the engineering provide exactly the support needed for such a result . 
too many record seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment . 
the group technique invite you to listen to the depth of the orchestration . 
your ear take you into the ensemble , and you may well become aware of instrumental detail which previously be apparent only in the score . 
it is this sort of experience that make the concept of high_fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener . 
the first substantially complete stereo giselle ( and the only one of its scope since person 's four-sided lp edition of 1958 for group ) , this set be , i'm afraid , likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment . 
the already faded pastel charm of the naive music itself vanish entirely in person 's melodramatic contrast between ultra vehement brute power and chilly , if suave , sentimentality . 
and in its engineer ' frantic attempt to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting brilliance , the recording sound as though it had been `` doctor for super high_fidelity '' . 
the home listener is overpower , all_right , but the experience be a far from pleasant one . 
as with the penultimate giselle release ( person 's abridgment for group ) i find the clean , less razor edged monophonic version , for all its lack of big stage spaciousness , the more aurally tolerable - but this may be the result of process defect in my sd copy . 
most recreation work call_for a good_deal of pre planning . 
this be particularly true in site selection . 
you must know before you start what the need and objective of your organization be ; you must have a list of requirement on where , how many , and what type site are need . 
with such a program you can make constructive selection of the best site available . 
begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photo if possible . 
these are become more_and_more available through the work of county and other government agency . 
the new_edition of topographical map being make by the federal_government be excellent for orient yourself to the natural feature of the site . 
these be inexpensive and available from the group , washington 25 , location . 
in recent year many county and the group have take aerial photo which show feature in_detail and be very good for planning use . 
most county also have map available from the county engineer show road and other feature and from the assessor 's office show ownership of land . 
inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily use for recreation . 
this give you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate condition , the exposure to the sun and wind , the water interest , etcetera , which vary greatly with the season . 
it be usually helpful to make a sketch_map in the field , show the size and location of the feature of interest and to take photograph at the site . 
these be a great aid for planning use back at the office . 
for site planning work , it be best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry_through the study . 
however , there be also much to be gain by make use of the ability of the local people who be available and interest in recreation . 
county judge , commissioner , engineer , assessor , and_others who have live in the area for a long_time may have valuable knowledge regard the site or opinion to offer from their varied professional experience . 
a visit to the site by a group of several person can usually bring_out new idea or verify opinion most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area . 
how much study is require ? 
this , of_course , depend_on the character of the site itself , the previous experience of the investigator , and the number of factor needed to arrive_at a good decision . 
it be too easy for the inexperienced_person to make a quick judgment of a_few value of the area and base a decision on these alone . 
usually there be more factor to good site planning than first impression . 
a site may be a run-down slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance today but have excellent potential for the future with a_little development or water . 
the same be true of area which at_first look good because of a_few existing recreation feature but may actually be poor area to develop for general public use . 
in look_for the best site available that meet the requirement , you need information to compare the site with others . 
you need answer to four important question . 
what be the existing recreation feature ? 
how well can the site be develop ? 
how useful will it be to the public ? 
be this site available ? 
check the quantity and quality of all_of the recreation interest already existing at the site . 
naturally , a park site with scenic view , a good lake , tree , and sand_dune , will attract more people than a nearby area with only tree and dune . 
quality be vitally important . 
frontage on a body of clear , clean water will be vastly different from the same amount of frontage on polluted water . 
some recreation feature , such as scenic value and water interest , also have great overall value than other interest . 
one of the most desirable feature for a park be beautiful view or scenery . 
it may be distant view of a valley or the mountain or natural feature such as a small lake , colorful rock formation , or unusual tree . 
a site which overlook a harbor or river may offer interest in the activity of boating traffic . 
an area on the coast may have relaxing view of the surf roll in on a beach . 
a site may also be attractive just through the beauty of its tree and shrub . 
note extent of these interest and how available they will be for the public to enjoy . 
water interest be one of the most valuable factor you can find for a recreation site . 
most park planner look_to water frontage for basic park area . 
this follow naturally since frontage on an ocean , stream , or lake provide scenic value and opportunity for the very popular recreation activity of bathing , fishing , boating , and other water_sport . 
a body_of_water be usually the center of interest at park which attract the greatest picnic and camping use . 
it also cool the air in summer and nourish the tree and wildlife . 
the amount of water frontage , the quantity and quality of the water , and the recreation afford by it be important . 
a restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use . 
the quantity of water flow may be critical ; a stream or pond which be attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer . 
if the site be on a reservoir , the level of the water at various season as it affect recreation should be study . 
check the quality of the water . 
a stream which have all_of its watershed within a national forest or other land under good conservation practice be less likely to be affect by pollution than one pass_through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area . 
other factor , such as water temperature , depth of water , the fish life it support , wave action , flood , etcetera , will affect its recreation value . 
other natural feature which can be of high interest be the forest , canyon , mountain , desert , seacoast , beach , sand_dune , waterfall , spring , etcetera with which the area is bless . 
just_as the national and state park place emphasis on feature which be of national or state significance , county should seek_out these feature which be distinctive of their area . 
although the site may not contain the feature themselves , there be often opportunity to include them as additional interest to the site . 
the route to the park may lead people past them or display view of them . 
a group of native tree or plant which be outstanding in a particular county can be feature at the site . 
the fish , animal , and bird which may be find at the site be another interest . 
fishing interest call_for a check of the species find , quantity and size , the season they be available , and the stocking program of the fish commission . 
animal may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby area . 
the site may be on one of the major flyway of migratory bird or have its own resident bird life . 
clam , crab , and other marine life may add interest at coastal area . 
each area have its own historical interest with which much can be do . 
park visitor be always eager to learn more about the area they be in . 
the historical sign tell its story , but nothing get_across interest across as well as some of the original historical item or place themselves which still have the character of the period cover . 
take_notice should be taken_of unusual rock formation , deposit , or shape of the earth 's crust in your region . 
those which tell a story of the earth 's formation in each area can add geological interest to the recreation site . 
an old shipwreck , a high dam , an old covered bridge , a place to find agate or other semiprecious stone or a place to pan gold , etcetera may be of interest . 
some area may provide archeological value such as ancient indian village site or hunting area , cave , artifact , etcetera . 
how well can the site be develop ? 
look at the physical feature of the land to determine how desirable it be for use , what can be do to correct the fault , and what it will cost to make the area meet your need in_comparison_to other site . 
many thing need to be check . 
the size of the area alone can be a determining_factor . 
an area may be too small for the need of the project . 
area should be large enough to include the attraction , have ample space for the use of facility needed , and have room around the edge to protect the value of the area from encroachment by private development . 
acreage in_excess_of the minimum be good practice as recreation area be never too large for the future and it be often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones . 
shape of the area is also related_to the use attraction and need of the development . 
a large picnic_area or camping development be most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred foot in_width in_preference_to a long narrow area less_than one_hundred foot wide . 
this be true because of saving in utility line and the fact that your building have a useful radius equal in all direction . 
however , a narrow strip may be very practical for small development , or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman 's trail , or include scenic strip within the park unit . 
the value of the site may be affect by the appearance of the adjoining land , ownership and use of the land , and the utility available there . 
for_instance , a site adjoining other publicly own land , such as a national forest or a public road , may be desirable , whereas a site next to an industrial plant might_not . 
the utility available nearby may provide a saving in the cost of extend electricity or water to the site . 
- topography be very important . 
check the elevation of the ground , degree and direction of slope , drainage , rock_outcrop , topsoil type and quality , as_well_as subsoil . 
nearly level area are require for parking_area , beach , camp area , ball_field , etcetera . 
determine how much topography limit useful area or what the cost of earth move or grading might be . 
- in_addition_to its recreation interest , water is need for drinking , sanitation , and irrigation . 
the quantity and quality of water source be often a big factor in site selection . 
the area may provide good spring or opportunity for a well or be near to municipal water_line . 
figure the cost of provide water to the use area . 
- the existing plant growth call_for thorough check . 
look at the tree as to size and interest , the amount of shade they provide , how healthy they be , the problem of maintenance , fire hazard , wind throw , etcetera . 
an area may have been partially log and require removal of stump or clean_up . 
some shrub may be of good landscaping value , other area of brush may need to be clear . 
the extent and location of open area is note . 
- how much will wind , rain , sun , and temperature affect the use ? 
an area sheltered from strong wind may be highly desirable for recreation use . 
the direction , velocity , and season of these wind should be note as to just how they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation of the area . 
lack of rainfall and extreme temperature may call_for the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable . 
sometimes , you have a choice of exposure for site where the topography or tree of the area will provide afternoon shade , morning sun , or whatever may be most_desirable for the use intended . 
- some area may already have been improve and contain building , road , utility , clear land , etcetera which may raise the cost of the site . 
the russian gymnast beat_the_tar_out_of the american gymnast in the 1960 olympics for one reason - they be better . 
they be better trained , better-looking , better built , better disciplined - and something else - they be better dancer . 
our athlete are only just begin to learn that they must study dance . 
the russian are all train as dancer before they start to study gymnastics . 
but why gymnastics at_all ? 
and be the sport really important ? 
after_all , we do pretty well in some other area of the olympics competition . 
but if it be important , what can we do to improve ourselves ? 
it be more than just lack of dance training that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance have some very important thing to learn from gymnastics . 
take first thing first , let 's understand the sport called gymnastics . 
it is make_up of tumbling , which might be say to start with a somersault , run_through such stunt as headstand , handstand , cartwheel , backbend , and culminate in nearly impossible combination of aerial flip and twist and apparatus work . 
the apparatus use by gymnast be once a common sight in american gym , but about 1930 it was in_favor_of game . 
the parallel_bars , horse , buck , springboard , horizontal_bar , ring , and mat formerly in the school gym were replace by baseball , volleyball , basketball and football . 
but the russian use gymnastics as the first_step in train for all other sport because it provide training in every basic quality except one , endurance . 
the gymnast must develop strength , flexibility , coordination , timing , rhythm , courage , discipline , persistence and the desire for perfection . 
in short , gymnastics use every part of the body and require a great_deal of character as_well . 
the addition of endurance training later , when the body be mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury , provide that final quality that make the top athlete , soldier or citizen . 
another reason gymnastic study be valuable be that it can be start very early in life . 
( an enterprising teacher or parent could start train a healthy child at the age of seven day . 
most european have been exercise newborn infant for century . ) 
in most sport , as in most walk_of_life , the angel be on the side of those who begin young , and the russian competitor of 16 have at_least thirteen year of training behind him . 
the american be very lucky if he have three . 
if a nation wish to get a head_start in physical fitness over all other nation , it would start its kindergarten student on a program of gymnastics the day they enter and thus eliminate a large_number of the problem that plague american school . 
first of the problem attack would be fatigue and emotional tension , since action relieve both . 
oddly_enough , it is prove that there would be less reading difficulty . 
certainly there would be less anxiety , fewer accident ( it be the clumsy child who sustain the worst injury ) , and high scholastic average , since alert child work better . 
russia know this , and that is why there be over 800000 compete for place as candidate for the olympic gymnastic team . 
eighty thousand win top honor and a chance to try_for the team itself . 
we could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people . 
and what have dancing to do with all this ? 
a great_deal . 
russia 's young gymnast have study dance before have the rigorous training on apparatus . 
well stretched , train in posture and coordinated movement , and wed to rhythm , they present the audience in rome with one of the most beautiful sight ever see at any olympic contest . 
american audience in particular learn two valuable lesson . 
they see completely masculine and obviously virile man perform with incredible grace . 
they were further strip of old_wives'_tale by see the slender , lovely russian girl perform feat require tremendous strength - and with not one bulging muscle . 
person has ask that we become a physically fit nation . 
if we wait until child be in junior_high or high_school , we will never manage it . 
to be fit , one has_to start early with young child , and today the only person who really reach such child be the teacher of dance . 
if the dance teacher of america make it their business to prepare their young charge for the gymnastics that must come someday if our school be really responsible , we will be that_much ahead . 
school_teacher , all_too unprepared for the job they must do , will need demonstrator . 
there should be youngster who know how to do a headstand , and also how to help other child learn it . 
they should know simple exercise that could prepare less fortunate child for the sport we will demand be teach . 
dance teacher can respond to person 's request not_only through their regular dance work , but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that make_for strength and flexibility . 
very little in today 's living provide the strength we need , and nothing provide the flexibility . 
dancer do have flexibility . 
they often fail , however , to develop real abdominal , back , chest , shoulder and arm strength . 
ask any group of ballerina to do ten pushup or three chin-up and the result , considering the amount of physical training they have have , will be very disappointing . 
even the boy will not be outstanding in these area . 
this be n't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11 - year old boy in america cannot chin themselves once , and that english schoolgirl outdo them in almost every test ( even dash and endurance ) . 
the only area in which american boy hold their own be the baseball throw . 
for arm and shoulder strength a chinning_bar is recommend . 
it should be install over a door that is in_full_view of everyone , and a chair should be place under it , a_little to one side . 
those child who can chin themselves should be tell to do one chin-up each time they pass under it . 
those who be too weak , should climb_on the chair and , start at the top of the chin , let_down themselves slowly down . 
when they can take ten second to accomplish the descent , they will have the strength to chin_up . 
parent should be inform about this system and encourage to do the same with the whole family at home . 
arm , shoulder , chest , upper and low back strength will be aid with the horse_kick . 
start on hand and foot . 
keep the hand in the starting position , run in_place to a quick rhythm . 
after this has become easy , use slow and slow rhythm , kick high and high . 
follow this by cross from one corner of the room to the other on_all_fours , kick as high as possible . 
pushup be essential , but few have the strength for them at_first . 
start on the knee in a large circle . 
fall slowly forward onto the hand and let_down the body down to rest_on the floor . 
push back up and repeat . 
do this exercise six time each class period . 
as strength improve start in a standing position with leg wide apart and upper body bend forward . 
start by fall forward to a point close to the foot , and , as strength improve , fall far and far out . 
try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate push from the hand . 
the pushup itself can be teach by start at the top of the pushup with leg spread wide . 
let_down the body down slowly , take at_least five second for the letting_down . 
five of these do daily for about a week will develop the strength for one pushup . 
handstand come after arm , chest and shoulder have develop at_least a minimum of strength . 
of_course those who have develop more will find them easy . 
start with the class stand in a circle , with weight on the right foot and the left extend a_little way into the circle . 
at_first each child should do a kick_up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone , and those who need help . 
drop both hand to the floor and at_the_same_time kick the right foot up in back . 
the left will follow at_once . 
the right will land first , follow by the left . 
return to the standing position . 
take_care should be taken to see that the hand are place on the floor before the kick start and also that the land foot is bring as close to the hand as possible . 
this will prevent flat fall and toe injury . 
bare foot be better for such work than any form of slipper . 
eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough so_that the teacher can catch the leading leg . 
the child should then bring both leg together overhead , point the toe and tighten the seat muscle . 
be sure that the land foot is bring close to the hand and that only one foot land at_a_time . 
the backbend be of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics , and , as with all acrobatics , the soon begin the better the result . 
have the class lie supine with knee apart and bent . 
place flat palm on either side of the head a_few inch away from the ear , finger point toward the shoulder . 
arch the back upwards to make a bridge . 
be sure the head drop backward so_that the child look at the floor rather_than toward the ceiling . 
as flexibility improve , the foot will move close to the hand and the bridge rise high . 
later this can be combine with the handstand to provide a walkover . 
to further increase back flexibility , work_on the back_circle . 
have the class lie prone . 
place the hand in_front_of the chest . 
keep the leg straight and the toe pointed . 
straighten the arm slowly , this arch the back . 
at the peak of the arch , tip the head back and bend the knee in an effort to touch toe to head . 
improvement can be measure by the lessening distance between toe and head . 
the last essential to the beginner 's gymnastic program be the somersault , or forward roll . 
this used_to be part of every child 's bag_of_tricks , but few child can do it today ; some be actually incapable of roll forward and be completely confused when not sit or stand upright . 
for most small child , learn a forward roll be simply a matter of copy another child who can . 
after it has been see , have the child start on a mat on hand and knee ( a thin , inexpensive mat be quite sufficient for anything that does not require fall ) . 
he place the hand on either side of the head , keep the chin down on the chest . 
he then push his seat into the air and the teacher guide it over . 
one or two practice run should be sufficient for solo . 
if , however , the child be weak , overweight , or afraid , more help will be need . 
when the child raise his seat into the air , the teacher take_hold under both side of the pelvis ; then no_matter_what_happens , the child 's performance will be control . 
by lift the seat upwards a_little , the weight is take_off the neck and the back is keep rounded . 
these be beginning , but correctly learn they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunt that can be perform by a strong , flexible body ( we are not talk of eccentric extreme ) . 
even if gymnastics be not the ultimate goal , the good tumbler will be a better dancer , a better athlete , and a human_being with a great margin of safety in any activity . 
it be very important for parent to understand that early training be imperative . 
and dancing_school , so helpful in artistic and psychological development , also contribute to this essential early training - and can contribute even more . 
the controversy of the last few year over whether architect or interior_designer should plan the interior of modern building has bring clearly into focus one important difference_of_opinion . 
the architect do not believe that the education of the interior_designer be sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior_designer be incapable of understand the architectural principle involved in plan the interior of a building . 
ordinary politeness may have militate against this opinion being state so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both group and who has sit through the many round_table , workshop or panel_discussion - whatever they be called - on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled-down crux_of_the_matter be education . 
it is true that most architectural school have five year course , some even have six or more . 
the element of public danger which enter so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure . 
this would , naturally , lengthen their course far beyond the largely esthetic demand of interior_designer 's training . 
we may then dismiss the time difference between these course and the usual four year course of the interior_design student as not have serious bearing on the subject . 
the real question that follow be - how are those four year use and what be their value as training ? 
the group has publish a recommended course for designer and a percentage layout of such a course . 
an examination of some forty catalog of school offer course in interior_design , for_the_most_part school accredit by membership in the group , and a further `` on_the_spot '' inspection of a number of school , show their course adhere pretty closely to the recommendation . 
one or two of the school have a five year curriculum , but the usual pattern of american education has limit most of them to the four year plan which seem to be the minimum in acceptable institution . 
the suggested course of the group was base on the usual course offer and on the opinion of many educator as to curricular necessity . 
obviously , the four year provision limit this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminate . 
without compare the relative merit of the two course - architecture versus interior_design - let us examine the educational need of the interior_designer . 
to_begin_with , what be an interior_designer ? 
`` the_dictionary_of_occupational_titles '' publish by the u.s. department_of_labor describe him as_follows : 
`` design , plan and furnish interior of house , commercial and institutional structure , hotel , club , ship , theater , as_well_as set_decoration for motion_picture arts and television . 
make drawing and plan of room show placement of furniture , floor_covering , wall decoration , and determine color_scheme . 
furnish complete cost estimate for client approval . 
make necessary purchase , place contracts , supervise construction , installation , finishing and placement of furniture , fixture and other correlated furnishings , and follow_through to completion of project `` . 
in_addition to this the u.s. group , when examine applicant for government position as interior_designer , expect that `` when various needed object be not obtainable on the market he will design them . 
he must be capable of design for and supervise the manufacture of any craft material need in the furnishings '' . 
this seem like a large_order . 
the interior_designer , then , must first be an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance . 
yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any reputable interior_designer does know all this and does practice it . 
and further he must understand his obligation to the client to not_only meet his physical necessity but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society . 
few will quarrel with the aim of the school or with the wording of their curriculum . 
it is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise . 
the old established independent art_school try their best to fulfill their obligation . 
yet even here many_a problem is present ; as in a recent design competition with a floor_plan and the simple command - `` design a luxury apartment '' ; no description of the client or his cultural level , no assertion of geographical_area or local social necessity - simply `` a luxury apartment '' . 
work in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in showpiece that look good in exhibition and catalog and may please the public_relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior_design . 
it is possible , of_course , to work_on extant or projected building where either architect or owner will explain their necessity so_that the student may get `` the feel '' of real interior_design demand . 
unfortunately , the purely synthetic problem be the rule . 
it be like medical_school in location where , in that fairyland of religious inhibition , the dissection of dead_body is frown_upon . 
instead they learn their dissection on the bulb of plant . 
thus technical efficiency is achieve at the expense of actual experience . 
in the early year of training certain phase of the work must be cover and the synthetic problem have its use . 
but to continue to divorce advanced student from reality be inexcusable . 
consultation with architect , client , real_estate man , fabric house and furniture company be essential to the proper development of class problem just as in actual work . 
fortunately , although only a_few year ago they hold the student at_arm's_length , today the business house welcome the opportunity to aid the student , not_only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today be the interior_designer of tomorrow - that the student already be `` in the trade '' . 
even the `` history of furniture '' can hardly be teach exclusively from photograph and lantern_slide . 
here , too , the reality of actual furniture must be experience . 
the professional organization such_as group , group , group and various trade association , can and do aid greatly in this work . 
certainly every educator involve in interior_design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organization . 
not_only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expect to be a member of one of the professional organization , but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinize that membership would be equivalent_to certification to teach the subject . 
participation for the educator in this case , however , would have_to be raise to full and complete membership . 
the largest of these organization at_present deny to the full-time educator any vote on the conduct and standard of the group and , indeed , refuse him even the right to attach the customary initial after his name in the college catalog . 
this anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the student . 
the professor in_turn dares not tolerate the influence in his class of an organization in the policy and standard of which he have no voice . 
this seem somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualification for membership which the organization profess are ever enforce , the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands . 
in one way the institute and society do a disservice to the school . 
that_is in the continuance of the `` grandfather_clause '' in their membership requirement . 
when these group were first form many prominent and accomplished decorator could not have have the advantage of school training since interior_design course be rare and undeveloped during their youth . 
long hard year of `` on_the_job '' training had bring them to their competence . 
the necessity of that day has long disappear . 
there be plenty of opportunity for proper education today . 
it be discouraging for student to realize that the society do not truly uphold the standard for which they be supposed to stand_for . 
the reason and the day of `` grandfather_clause '' has long_since pass . 
no one can deny that these `` back_door '' admission to membership provision have been seriously abuse nor that they have not result in the admission of downright incompetent to membership in supposedly learned society . 
beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teacher themselves . 
it will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education , a depth and breadth of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessity of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his student . 
the local decorator who rush in for a_few hour of teaching may but more likely may_not have these qualification . 
nor will the hack , the jack_of_all_trades , still find in some of the smaller art_school , suffice . 
only a_few year ago a midwestern college circulate a request for a teacher of interior_design . 
at the end of its letter be the information that applicant for this position `` must also be prepare to teach costume design and advertising art '' . 
this kind of irresponsibility toward their student can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer . 
we must build a corps of highly professional teacher of interior_design who have have education , experience in the profession and be willing to take_on the usual accompaniment of teaching - minimal income and minimal status among their confrere . 
considerable specialization in teaching subject such_as architecture , furniture design , textile and color be also desirable . 
in all `` degree '' course in interior_design a number of `` academic '' or `` general study '' course are include . 
it be only fair to demand that teacher of course in english , history , psychology and_so_on be as well informed in matter of art , especially interior_design , as be the art_teacher educated in the academic subject . 
the proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieve only_if this standard is observe . 
the matter of sympathy of the academic professor for art objective also must be take_into_account . 
one technical question of school organization come_to_mind here . 
for proper accreditation of school , teacher in any course must have a degree at_least one level above that for which the student be a candidate . 
since there be almost no school in the country offer graduate work in interior_design this rule cannot at_present be observe . 
indeed , it has only be a matter of the last few year that reputable school of art have grant degree at_all . 
the question , however , cannot be ignore for long . 
the basic problem involve be that a college set_up a graduate_school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree . 
most professor in the course must , naturally , again have a high degree than the course offer . 
one solution be the acquisition of degree in education but it be a poor substitute . 
it be a sort_of academic ring-around-a-rosy and you solve it . 
this bring us to the question of accreditation of art_school in_general . 
only the independent art_school , that_is , those not connected with any university or college , receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organization . 
it has be the custom for most university to stretch_the_blanket of accreditation for their liberal_arts school to cover_the_shivering_body of their fine_arts department . 
this , plus the habit of many school of simply add interior_design to the many subject of their home_economics department , yet , nevertheless , claim that they teach interior_design , has contribute to the low repute of many university course in interior_design . 
in_spite_of this , many university offer adequate and even distinguished course in the subject . 
there will be no mitigation of these offence until all art_school , whether independent or attached to university have separate accreditation - as do medical_school - by an art accreditation group such_as the `` group '' . 
independent art_school grant degree must , naturally , follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate regional group . 
there be a pause in the merriment as your friend gaze at you , wonder why you are stare , openmouthed in amazement . 
you explain , `` i have the strange feeling of having live through this very same event before . 
i can n't tell when , but i'm positive i witness this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past '' ! 
this experience will have happen to many of you . 
person , in his lecture , refer to the `` startling experience which almost every person confess in daylight , that particular passage of conversation and action have occur to him in the same order before , whether dream or wake , a suspicion that they have be with precisely these person in precisely this room , and hear precisely this dialogue , at some former hour , they know not when '' . 
most psychiatrist dismiss these instance of that weird feeling as the deja_vu ( already see ) illusion , just as they dismiss dream prevision as coincidence . 
in this manner they sidestep the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depth of mystery in which all_of us grope continually . 
when a man recognize a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream , we have an instance of deja_vu , except for the fact that he know just why the experience seem familiar . 
occasionally there be example of prevision which cannot be push_aside without confess an unscientific attitude . 
one day person , come_upon with a friend upon an event which he recognize as the exact pattern of a previous dream , detail the ensuing occurrence in_advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystify . 
person 's scorn for the `` jargon '' of psychical research was alter somewhat when he wonder `` how , or why , had i been show an unreleased roll of my life film '' ? 
the famous author tell us of the strange incident in something_about_myself . 
one day when he attend a war memorial ceremony in group his view was obstruct by a stout man on his left , his attention turn to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasp him by the arm , whisper , `` i want a word with you , please '' . 
at that moment person was overwhelm with awed amazement , suddenly recall that these identical details of scene , action and word had occur to him in a dream six week earlier . 
person probably contribute more_than anyone else to the understanding of dream , enable us to recognize their equivalent in our wakeful thought . 
however , reader who accept person 's finding and believe that he has solve completely the mystery of dream , should ponder over the following words in his interpretation_of_dreams , chapter 1 , : `` as_a_matter_of_fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplish in_any_case , and what_is_more , every one attempt such solution has find that in most case there have remain a great many component of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain , nor is the discussion close on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dream '' . 
dream present many mystery of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision . 
the basic mystery of dream , which embrace all the others and challenge us from even the most common typical dream , be in the fact that they be original , visual continuity . 
i recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which i live through the horror of the bombing of a little korean town . 
i be sure that nothing within me be capable of compose that lifelike sequence , so complete in_detail , from the hodgepodge of news picture i have see . 
and when psychology explain glibly , `` but the subconscious_mind be able to produce it '' it refer to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind . 
skeptic may deny the more startling phenomenon of dream as thing they have never personally observe , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery be outright avoidance of routine evidence . 
the question become , `` what be a dream '' ? 
be a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie ? 
every dream , and this be true of a mental_image of any type even though it may be readily interpret into its equivalent of wakeful thought , be a psychic_phenomenon for which no explanation be available . 
in most case we recognize certain words , person , animal or object . 
but these are dream in original action , in some particular continuity which we do n't remember having see in real_life . 
for_instance , the dreamer see himself seat behind neighbor person and , with photographic realism , see person drive the car ; whereas , it is a matter of fact that person cannot drive a car . 
there be nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impression to fit into an original , realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dream . 
the entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental_image can find no logical support . 
a `` mental_image '' subconsciously impress us from beneath its language symbol in wakeful thought , or consciously in light sleep , be actually not an image at_all but is comprise of reality , view not in the concurrent sensory stream , but within the depth of the fourth_dimension . 
dream that display event of the future with photographic detail call_for a theory explain their basic mystery and all its component , include that weird feeling of deja_vu , inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem . 
as in the theory of perception , establish in psychophysiology , the eye is recognize as an integral part of the brain . 
but then this theory confess that it be completely at_a_loss as to how the image can possibly be receive by the brain . 
the opening paragraph of the chapter title the_theory_of_representative_perception , in the book philosophies_of_science by person say , `` pass_on to the brain , and there , by some unexplained process , it cause the mind to have a perception '' . 
but why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? 
as retinal image are concede to be an integral function of the brain it seem logical to suppose that the nerve , between the inner brain and the eye , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain center - rather_than to theorize on the transmission of an image which be already in required location . 
hereby , the external object view by the eye remain the thing that is see , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stir sympathetic impulse in the other sensory center , motor tension , associated word symbol , and consciousness . 
modern physics has develop the theory that all matter consist_of minute wave of energy . 
we know that the number of radio and television impulse , sound_wave , ultraviolet ray , etc. , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , be infinite . 
so we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal , apparently momentary state_of_matter , successive one_after_another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequency . 
this theory make it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness . 
space in any form is completely measure by the three dimension . 
if the fourth_dimension be a physical concept and not purely metaphysical , through what medium does it extend ? 
it is not through space nor time that the time_machine most approve by science_fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past , or the ever existent past fantasy future . 
three second flat be the usual time , and the space is cross by moderate mileage , while the overwhelming immensity of such journey must be conceive as a static pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequency which perpetuate all event . 
the body , sense and brain , in_common_with all matter , have their counterpart on each of a countless number of frequency . 
the sense in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomenon that share its own frequency , whereas those upon all other frequency be invisible , inaudible and intactible to them . 
consciousness be the factor that provide the progressive continuity to sensory impression . 
when consciousness desert the sleeping body and the wakeful world , it continue in the myriad progression of the ever-present past and future , in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tire and require sleep . 
if the photographically realistic continuity of dream , however bizarre their combination , deny that it be purely a composition of the brain , it must be compound from view of diverse reality , although some of them may never be encounter in what we are please to call the real_life . 
person , professor of assyrian at the group , dream that a babylonian priest , associated with the king person , ( 1300 bc . ) escort him to the treasure chamber of the temple of location , give him six novel point of information about a certain broken relic , and correct an error in its identification . 
as_a_matter_of_fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many week of labor by person , was about to be publish by him the following day . 
some time later the missing part of the relic was find and the complete inscription , together with other new evidence , fully corroborate the ancient priest 's information . 
person be uncertain as to the language use by the ancient priest in his dream . 
he be almost positive it be not assyrian nor cassite , and imagine it must have been german or english . 
we may conclude that all six point of information , ostensibly give by the dream priest , could have been furnish by person 's subconscious reasoning . 
but , in deny any physical reality for this dream , how could the brain possibly compose that realistic , vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout , violent break or sudden substitution ? 
which theory be more fantastic : 1 . 
that the perfect continuity was compose from the job_lot of memory impression in the professor 's brain , or 2 . 
that the dream be a reality on the infinite progression of universal , gradient frequency , across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient location meet ? 
the degree of circumstance , the ratio of memory to forgetfulness , determine whether a dream will be a recognized , fulfill prevision , or the vaguely , effective source of the weird deja_vu feeling . 
no_doubt some experience vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the sleeper 's mind . 
probably less_than one_percent of our prevision escape final obliteration before we wake . 
when we arrive_at the event concern in the vanished majority , they , of_course , cannot impress us as anything familiar . 
nevertheless , there be notably frequent instance of deja_vu , in which our recognition of an entirely novel event be a feeling of having live through it before , a feeling which , though vague , withstand the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologist . 
if deja_vu be an illusion , then peculiarly , it be a most prevalent mental_disturbance affect even the most levelheaded people . 
person , onetime runner-up for the republican presidential nomination , was attend a convention at location , where he was schedule to nominate person for governor of new_york when he notice that the temporary chairman be a man he had never meet . 
after the preliminary business affair was finish person arise and deliver the convincing speech that clinch the nomination for person . 
if person had tell any academic psychologist that he have a weird feeling of having live through that identical convention session at some time in the past , he would have been inform that he be a victim of deja_vu . 
but the famous orator feel more than vague recognition for the scene . 
he remember exactly when he had live through it before , and he had something to prove he have . 
one week before the convention , person was seated on the porch of a country home on the hudson , gaze at the opposite shore . 
person prove a man of prompt action when person , accompany by a friend , visit him in location , california , several month ago as a prospective patient . 
`` doctor '' person ask her to lie_down on a bed and remove her shoe . 
then , by squeeze her foot three time , he come_up - presto - with a different diagnosis with each squeeze . 
she have - he inform her - kidney trouble , liver trouble , and a severe female disorder . 
( he explain that he could diagnose these ailment from squeeze her foot because all_of the nervous_system be connected to it . ) 
he know just the thing for her - a treatment from his `` cosmic light ozone generator '' machine . 
as he apply the applicator extend from the machine - which consist_of seven differently colored neon_tube superimpose on a rectangular base - to the supposedly diseased portion of person 's body , person keep_up a steady stream of pseudo scientific mumbo_jumbo . 
yes , the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything , he assure her . 
did she know , he ask , why the color of the tube be important to people 's health ? 
the human_body - he point_out , for_example - require 33 unit of blue light . 
for that reason , he inform her , the lord make the sky blue . 
continue glibly in this vein , he pause to comfort her : 
`` do n't you worry . 
this machine will cure your cancer ridden body '' . 
`` cancer '' ! 
person practically shriek . 
`` you did n't tell me i have cancer '' . 
`` you have it , all_right . 
but as_long_as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about . 
why , i once use this machine to cure a woman with 97 pound of cancer in her body '' . 
he urge her to buy one of his machine - for $ 300 . 
when she say that she did n't have the money , he say that she could come_in for treatment with his office model until she be ready to buy one . 
he then sell her mineral to cure her kidney ailment , a can of sage `` to make her look_like a girl again '' , and an application of plain mud to take_away her wrinkle away . 
person renew his pressure on person to buy his machine when she visit him the next day . 
after another treatment with the machine , he tell her that `` her entire body was shot_through with tumor and cyst '' . 
he then sell her some capsule that he assert would take_care of the tumor and cyst until she could collect the money for buy his machine . 
when she submit to his treatment with the capsule , person feel intense pain . 
leave person 's office , person hurry over to her family physician , who treat her for burn tissue . 
for several day , she be ill as a result of person 's treatment . 
person never get_around_to join the thousand or_so people who pay person some $ 30000 for his ozone machine . 
for person - who had been give a clean bill_of_health by her own physician at the time she visit person - and her friend be agent for the group and group . 
and she feel amply reward for her suffering when the evidence of person 's quack shenanigan , gather by the tape_recorder under her friend 's clothing , prove adequate in court for convict person . 
the charge : violation of the california medical_practice act by practice medicine without a license and sell misbranded drug . 
the sentence : 360 day ' confinement in the county jail . 
an isolated case of quackery ? 
by_no_means . 
rather , it be typical of the thousand of quack who use phony therapeutic device to fatten themselves on the misery of hundred of thousand of american by rob them of millions of dollar and lure them away from legitimate , ethical medical treatment of serious disease . 
the machine quack make his person device out of odds_and_ends of metal , wire , and radio part . 
with these gadget - impressive to the gullible because of their flash light_bulb , tick , and buzz - he then carry_out a vicious medical con_game , capitalize on people 's respect for the electrical and atomic wonder of our scientific age . 
he milk the latest scientific advance , translate them into his own special person vocabulary to huckster his fake machine as a cure-all for everything from hay_fever to sexual impotence and cancer . 
the gadget faker operate or sell his phony machine for $ 5 to $ 10000 - anything the traffic will bear . 
he may call himself a naprapath , a physical_therapist , an electrotherapist , a naturopath , a sanipractor , a medical cultist , a masseur , a `` doctor '' - or what have you . 
not_only do these quack assume impressive title , but represent themselves as be associated with various scientific or impressive foundation - foundation which often have little more than a letterhead existence . 
the medical device pirate of today , of_course , be a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor of yesteryear - the gallus snap hawker of snake_oil and other patent_medicine . 
his plunder be therefore far high - run into hundred of millions . 
according_to the group ( group ) , `` doctor '' person , person and his clique , and person - to name three notorious device quack - succeed , respectively , in distribute 10000 , 5000 , and 2000 fake health machine . 
authorities believe that many_of the doctor fraud use these false health gadget be still in business . 
look_at the sum pay by two device quack victim in cleveland . 
person , a dress_shop proprietor , pay $ 1020 to a masseur , and person , a laborer , pay $ 4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machine - the `` radioclast '' and the `` diagnometer '' . 
multiply these figure by the million of people know to be con by medical pirate annually . 
you will come_up with a frightening total . 
that 's why the group , the group ( group ) , and the person ( group ) have estimate the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $ 610 million or_so pay to medical charlatan annually . 
the postmaster_general recently report that mail_order fraud - among which fake therapeutic device figure prominently - be at the highest level in history . 
similarly , the group ( group ) , the group , and the group have each state lately that medical quackery be at a new high . 
for_example , the group has report it was receive four_times as many inquiry about quack device and 10 times as_many complaint compare with two year ago . 
authorities hesitate to quote exact figure , however , believe that any sum they come_up with be only a surface manifestation - turn_up by their inevitably limit police - of the real loot of the medical racketeer . 
in this sense , authorities believe that all estimate of phony device quackery be conservative . 
the economic toll that the device quack extracts be important , of_course . 
but it is our health - more precious than all the money in the world - that these modern witch_doctor with their fake therapeutic gadget are gamble away . 
by prey on the sick , by play callously on the hope of the desperate , by cause the sufferer to delay proper medical_care , these medical ghoul create pain and misery by their very activity . 
typically , person and person both lose more than their money as the result of their experience with their cleveland quack . 
person find that the treatment give her for a nervous ailment by the masseur were not help her . 
as a result , she consult medical authorities and learn that the device her quack `` doctor '' was use be phony . 
she suffer a nervous_breakdown and had to be institutionalize . 
person , her fellow townsman , also experience a nervous_breakdown just as_soon_as he discover that he had been bilk of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been treat his wife - a woman suffer from an incurable disease , multiple_sclerosis - and himself . 
person has recover , but he be , justifiably , a bitter man . 
`` that 's a lot of hard earned money to lose '' , he say today . 
`` neither me nor my wife were help by that chiropractor 's treatment '' . 
and there be the case of person , a machinist , who was refer by a friend to a health machine quack who treat him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what person say be a system full of arsenic and strychnine . 
after his pain get_worse , person decide to see a real doctor , from whom he learn he was suffer from cancer of the lung . 
yes , person catch it in_time to stay alive . 
but he be a welfare_case now - a human wreck - thank to this modern witch_doctor . 
but the machine quack can cause far more than just suffering . 
in such disease as cancer , tuberculosis , and heart_disease , early diagnosis and treatment be so vital that the waste_of_time by the patient with person 's cure-all gadget can prove fatal . 
moreover , the diabetic patient who rely_on cure by the quack device and therefore cut_off his insulin intake can be commit suicide . 
for_instance : 
in location , some time ago , person , age 27 , a diabetic since he be six , stop use insulin because he had buy a `` magic spike '' - a glass tube about the size of a pencil fill with barium chloride worth a small fraction of a cent - sell by the group of location for $ 306 as a cure-all . 
`` hang this around your neck or attach it to other part of your anatomy , and its ray will cure any disease you have '' , say the company . 
person be dead today because he follow this advice . 
person , suffer from tuberculosis , was take by her husband to see person , a sanipractor - a licensed drugless healer - in location . 
person diagnose person by take a drop of blood from her ear and put it on his `` radionic '' machine and twirl some knob ( fee $ 50 ) . 
his prescription : hot and cold compress to increase her absorption of water . 
although she weigh only 108 pound when she visit him , person permit her to go on a 10 - day fast in which she take nothing but water . 
inevitably , person die of starvation and tuberculosis , weigh 60 pound . 
moreover , her husband and child contract t.b. from her . 
( small wonder a location jury award the husband $ 35823 for his wife 's death . ) 
in location , a_few year ago , a ghoul by the name of person sell electric blanket as a cure for cancer . 
he do this by the charming practice of buy_up used electric blanket for $ 5 to $ 10 from survivor of patient who had die , recondition them , and sell them at $ 185 each . 
when authorities convict him of practice medicine without a license ( he get_off with a suspended sentence of three year because of his advanced age of 77 ) , one of his victim be not around to testify : he be dead of cancer . 
by_no_means be these isolated case . 
`` unfortunately '' , say person , who has prosecute many device quack , `` the ghoul who trade on the hope of the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecute because the patient who be the chief witness die before the case is call_up in court '' . 
death ! 
have no_doubt about it . 
that 's where device quackery can lead . 
the evidence show that fake therapeutic machine , substitute for valid medical cure , have hasten the death of thousand . 
who be the victim of the device quack ? 
authorities say that oldster be a prime target . 
say person , director of the group 's group : `` quack be apt to direct their appeal directly to older people , or to sufferer from chronic ailment such_as arthritis , rheumatism , diabetes , and cancer . 
people who have not be able to get relief from regular medical doctor be especially apt to be take_in by quack '' . 
the victim of the quack be frequently poor people , like person , who scrape_up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice to person 's avarice . 
they be often ignorant as_well_as underprivileged . 
the popularity of folklore in america stand in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in america . 
and the emphasis on nationalism in america be in_proportion_to the growth of american influence across the world . 
thus , if we are to observe american folklore in the twentieth century , we will do_well to establish the relationship between folklore , nationalism and imperialism at the outset . 
historian have come to recognize two cardinal fact concern nationalism and international influence . 
1 ) every age rewrite the event of its history in_terms_of what should have be , create legend about itself that rationalize contemporary belief and excuse contemporary action . 
what actually occur in the past be seldom as important as what a given generation feel must have occur . 
2 ) as a country superimpose its cultural and political attitude on others , it search its heritage in hope of justify its aggressiveness . 
its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allow to account_for group_action , to provide a focal_point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification . 
one can apply these fact to britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth century as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be apply again to the united_states in more recent year . 
the popularity of local color literature before the spanish-american_war , the steady currency of the lincoln myth , the increased emphasis on the frontier west in our mass_media be case_in_point . 
nor is it an accident that baseball , grow into the national game in the last 75 year , has become a microcosm of american life , that learned society such_as the group and the group were found in the 1880's , or that course in american literature , american civilization , american anything have sweep our school and college curriculum . 
of_course , nationalism has really outlive its usefulness in a country as world oriented as ours , and its continued existence reflect one of the major culture lag of the twentieth century united_states . 
yet nationalism has lose few of its charm for the historian , writer or man_in_the_street . 
it is an understandable paradox that most american history and most american literature be today write from an essentially egocentric and isolationist point_of_view at the very time america is spread her dominion over palm and pine . 
after_all , the average american as he lie and wait for the enemy in korea or as she scan the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front be unconcerned that his or her plight be the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental action far beyond the normal citizen 's comprehension and control . 
anyone 's identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , require absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement . 
such identification come for each group in each crisis by rewrite history into legend and develop appropriate national hero . 
in america , such self-deception has serve a particularly useful purpose . 
a heterogeneous people have need it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever-changing land . 
but we must never forget , most_of the appropriate hero and their legend were create overnight , to answer immediate need , almost always with conscious aim and end . 
person 's george_washington become the symbol of honesty and the father image of the unite state . 
abraham_lincoln emerge as an incarnation of the national constitution . 
robert_e_lee represent the dignity needed by a rebelling confederacy . 
and their role are parallel by those of person , person , person , person , person and many , many more . 
therefore , the scholar , as he look_at our national folklore of the last 60 year , will be mindful of two fact . 
1 ) most_of the legend that are create to fan the fires of patriotism be essentially propagandistic and be not folk legend at_all . 
2 ) the concept that an `` american national folklore '' exist be itself probably another propagandistic legend . 
folklore be individually create art that a homogeneous group of people preserve , vary and recreate through oral transmission . 
it has come to mean myth , legend , tale , song , proverb , riddle , superstition , rhyme and such literary form of expression . 
relate to written literature , and often remain temporarily freeze in written form , it lose its vitality when transcribe or remove from its oral existence . 
though it may exist in either literate or illiterate society , it assume a role of true cultural importance only in the latter . 
in its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage , the public has remain ignorant of definition such as this . 
enthusiastically , american have sweep_up subliterary and bogus material like person tale , abraham_lincoln anecdote and labor_union song up as true product of our american oral tradition . 
nor have we remember that in the melting_pot of america the hundred of isolated and semi isolated ethnic , regional and occupational group did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had cause them to cast_aside oral tradition aside as a means of carry culturally significant material . 
naturally , such scholarly fact be of little concern to the man try to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore . 
that much of what he call folklore be the result of belief carefully sow among the people with the conscious aim of produce a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situation be irrelevant . 
as_long_as his material be americana , can in_some_way be ascribe to the masses and appear `` democratic '' to his audience , he remain satisfied . 
from all this we can now see that two stream of development run through the history of twentieth century american folklore . 
on the one side we have the university professor and their student , train in teutonic method of research , who have seek_out , collect and study the true product of the oral tradition of the ethnic , regional and occupational group that make_up this nation . 
on the other we have the flag-waver and the national sentimentalist who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western '' or colonial material willy-nilly . 
unfortunately , few of the artist ( writer , movie producer , dramatist and musician ) who have use american folklore since 1900 have know enough to distinguish between the two stream even in the most general of way . 
after_all , the field be large , difficult to define and seldom teach properly to american undergraduate . 
in_addition , this country has been settle by many people of many heritage and their lore has become acculturate slowly , in an age of print and easy communication , within an ever expanding and changing society . 
the problem confuse even the expert . 
for_that_matter , the expert themselves be a mixed breed . 
anthropologist , housewife , historian and such by profession , they approach their discipline as amateur , collector , commercial propagandist , analyst or some combination of the four . 
they have widely varying background and aim . 
they have little `` esprit_de_corps '' . 
the outlook for the amateur , for_instance , be usually dependent_on his fondness for local history or for the picturesque . 
his love of folklore have romanticism in it , and he does n't care much about the dollar_sign or the footnote . 
folklore be his hobby , and he , all_too rightly , wish it to remain as such . 
the amateur be closely related to the collector , who be actually no more_than the amateur who has take_to the field . 
the collector enjoy the contact with rural life ; he hunt folklore for the very `` field and stream '' reason that many person hunt game ; and only rarely be he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has locate . 
fundamentally , both these type , the amateur and the collector , be uncritical and many of them do n't distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material . 
but there are also the commercial propagandist and the analyst - one dominated_by money , the other by nineteenth century german scholarship . 
both be primarily concerned with the use that can be make of the material that the collector has find . 
both shudder at the thought of proceed too far beyond the sewage_system and the electric light line . 
the commercial propagandist , who can n't afford to be critical , get_along well with the amateur , from whom he feed , but he frequently steps on the analyst 's toes by refuse to keep his material genuine . 
his standard be , of_course , completely foreign to those of the analyst . 
to both the amateur and the commercial propagandist the analyst lack a soul , lack appreciation with his endless probing and classification . 
dominated_by the vicious_circle of the university promotion_system , the analyst looks_down_on and get_along poorly with the other three group , although he cannot deny his debt to the collector . 
the knowledge that most american have of folklore come through contact with commercial propagandist and a_few energetic amateur and collector . 
the work do by the analyst , the man who really know what folklore be all about , have no_more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort and reach a limited , learned audience . 
publisher want book that will sell , recording_studio want disc that will not seem strange to ear used_to hillbilly_music and jazz music , grade_school and high_school want quaint , but moral , material . 
the analyst be apt to be too honest to fit_in . 
as a result , most people do n't have more than a vague idea what folklore actually be ; they see it as a potpourri of charming , moral legend and patriotic anecdote , with a superstition or remedy throw_in here_and_there . 
and so well is such ignorance preserve by the amateur and the moneymaker that even at the college_level most_of the hundred odd folklore course give in the united_states survive on sentiment and nationalism alone . 
if one wish to discuss a literary figure who use folklore in his work , the first thing he must realize be that the literary figure be probably part of this ignorant american public . 
and while every writer must be deal with as a special case , the interested student will want to ask himself a number of question about each . 
does the writer know the difference between an `` ersatz '' ballad or tall_tale and a true product of the folk ? 
when the writer use material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial effect or does he leave it pure ? 
be the writer propagandistic ? 
is he sweep_away by sentiment and nostalgia for an america that be ? 
or does he sincerely want to tap the real spring of american attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be ? 
when he get the answer to his question he will be discouraged . 
in_the_first_place , a good many writer who are say to use folklore , do not , unless one count an occasional superstition or tale . 
person , for_instance , write about rural life in new_england , but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poem . 
this has not , however , prevent publisher from label him a `` folk_poet '' , simply because he be a rural one . 
in the second place , a large_number of writer , make a more direct claim than person to be `` folk_writer '' of one sort or another , clearly make no distinction between genuine and bogus material . 
person 's john_brown's_body come immediately to mind in this connection , as does person 's the_grapes_of_wrath and person 's the_people,_yes . 
the last two writer introduce strong political bias into their work , and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon , see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publicly silenced mass . 
folklore , as use by such writer , really reflect image engrave into it by the very person use it . 
the folk be simply not homogeneous with_respect_to nation or political attitude . 
in_fact , there is much evidence to indicate they do n't care a_bit about anything beyond their particular regional , ethnic and occupational limit . 
nevertheless , with a reading public that long for `` the_good_old_days '' and with an awareness of our expanding international interest , it is easy for the person to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sort of americana , real or fake , and it is easy for the person and person to support their message of reform by read message of reform into the mind of the folk . 
color was delay until 1935 , the wide_screen until the early fifties . 
movement itself be the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movie of the nineties . 
each film consist_of fifty foot , which give a running_time of about one minute on the screen . 
as_long_as audience come to see the movement , there seem little reason to adventure further . 
motion_picture exhibition take_place in store in a general atmosphere like that of the penny_arcade which can still be find in such urban_area as location . 
brief snip of actual event were show : parade , dance , street scene . 
the sensational and frightening enjoy popularity : 
a train rush straight at the audience , or a great wave threaten to break over the seat . 
an early person production be the_execution_of_mary_queen_of_scotts . 
the unfortunate queen mount the scaffold ; the headsman swing his axe ; the head drop off ; end of film . 
an early film by a competitor of the wizard of location simply show a long kiss perform by two actor of the contemporary stage . 
in the field of entertainment there be no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom , and the first decade of the new device be not over before audience begin stay away in large_number from the simple-minded , one minute show . 
in response , the industry allow the discovery of the motion_picture as a form of fiction and thus give the movie the essential form they have have to this day . 
despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentary , art film , and travelogue , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as cinerama , the movie be at_heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short_story . 
moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction film have invariably borrow the narrative form from the fiction feature . 
thus such great american documentary as the_river and the_plow_that_broke_the_plains were compose as visual story rather_than as illustrate lecture . 
the discovery that movie be a form of fiction was make in the early year of this century and it was make chiefly by two man , a french magician , person , and an american employee of person , person . 
of the two , person be justly the better_known , for he go far beyond the vital finding of fiction for film to take the first_step toward fashion a language of film , toward make the motion_picture the intricate , efficient time_machine that it has remain since , even in the most inept hands . 
person , however , out of his professional instinct as a magician , discover and make use of a number of illusionary technique that remain part of the vocabulary of film . 
one of these is the `` dissolve '' , which make possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene . 
as the first scene begin to fade , the succeeding scene begin to appear . 
for a moment or two , both scene be present simultaneously , one grow weak , one grow strong . 
in a series of fairytale and fantasy , person demonstrate that the film be superbly equipped to tell a straightforward story , with beginning , middle and end , complication , resolution , climax , and conclusion . 
immediately , the film improve and it improve because in narrative it find a content base on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time . 
physically , a movie be possible because a series of image is project one at_a_time at such a speed that the eye `` remember '' the one that has go before even as it register the one now appear . 
link the smoothly changing image together , the eye itself endow them with the illusion of movement . 
the `` projection '' time of painting and sculpture be highly subjective , vary from person to person and even vary for a given person on different occasion . 
so be the time of the novel . 
the drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time , but the time is fix by the director and the player , the conductor and the instrumentalist , subject_to , therefore , to much variation , as record collector well know . 
the time of the motion_picture is fixed absolutely . 
the film consist_of a series of still , transparent photograph , or `` frame '' , 35 - mm - wide . 
each frame come between the light and the lens and is individually project on the screen , at the rate , for silent_movie , of 16 frame per second , and , for sound film , 24 frame per second . 
this be the rate of projection ; it be also the rate of photograph . 
time is build into the motion_picture , which cannot exist without time . 
now time be also the concern of the fictional narrative , which be , at its simple , the story of an action with , usually , a beginning , a middle , and an end - element which demand time as the first condition for their existence . 
the `` moving '' picture of the train or the wave come at the audience be , to_be_sure , more intense than a still picture of the same subject , but the difference be really one of degree ; the cinematic element of time is merely use to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo . 
in narrative , time be essential , as it be in film . 
almost everything about the movie that is peculiarly of the movie derive from a tension create and maintain between narrative time and film time . 
this discovery of person be vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling , magician 's trick produce on film . 
it be person , however , who produce the very first movie whose name has live on through the half century of film history that has since ensue . 
the movie be the great_train_robbery and its effect on the young industry and art be all_but incalculable . 
overnight , for_one_thing , person 's film multiply the standard running_time of movie by ten . 
the great_train_robbery be a one reel film . 
one reel - from eight to twelve minute - become the standard length from the year of robbery , 1903 , until person shatter that limit forever with birth_of_a_nation in 1915 . 
the reel itself become and still be the standard of measure for the movie . 
the material of the person film be simplicity itself ; much of_it has continue to be use over the year and the heart of_it - good_guy and bad_guy in the old west - pretty well dominate television toward the end of the 1950's . 
a band of robber enter a railroad_station , overpower and tie_up the telegraph_operator , hold_up the train and escape . 
a posse is form and pursue the robber , who , having make their escape , are whoop_it_up with some wild , wild woman in a honky-tonk hideout . 
the robber run from the hideout , take cover in a wooded declivity , and are shoot dead by the posse . 
as a finale is append a closeup of one of the band take_aim and fire his revolver straight at the audience . 
all this be simple enough , but in tell the story person do two important thing that had not been do before . 
each scene is shoot straight through , as had be the universal custom , from a camera fix in a single position , but in the outdoor scene , especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaw , person 's camera position break , necessarily , with the camera position standard until then , which had be , roughly , that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play . 
the plane of the action in the scene be not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen . 
if the change , at_first_sight , seem minor , we may recall that it take the italian painter about two hundred year to make an analogous change , and the italian painter , by universal consent , be the most brilliant group of genius any art has see . 
in that apparently simple shift person open the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as_well_as a mechanical recording device . 
he do more than that . 
he reveal the potential value of the `` cut '' as the basic technique in the art of the film . 
cutting , of_course , take_place automatically in the creation of a film . 
the meaning of the word be quite physical , to_begin_with . 
the physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence , and the cut edge is join physically , by cement , to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence . 
if , as a home_movie maker , you shoot the inevitable footage of your child take its first steps , you have merely record an historical event . 
if , in prepare that shot for the inevitable showing to your friend , you interrupt the sequence to paste in a_few frame of the child 's grandmother watch this event , you have begin to be an artist in film ; you are employ the basic technique of film ; you are cut . 
this be what person do . 
as the robber leave the looted train , the film suddenly cut_back to the station , where the telegrapher 's little daughter arrive with her father 's dinner_pail only to find him bound on the floor . 
she dash around in alarm . 
the two event are take_place at_the_same_time . 
time and space have both become cinematic . 
we leap from event to event - include the formation of the posse - even though the event , in_reality `` reality '' are take_place not in sequence but simultaneously , and not near each other but at a considerable distance . 
the `` chase '' as a standard film device probably date_from the_great_train_robbery , and there be a reason for the continued popularity of the device . 
the chase in itself be a narrative ; it presume both speed and urgency and it demand cutting - both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both . 
the simple , naked idea of one man chase another be of its nature better fit for the film than it is for any other form of fiction . 
the cowboy film , the cop and robber film , and the slapstick comedy film culminate in an insane chase are not_only cater to what critic may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence ; these film and these sequence are also seek_out - instinctively or by_design - the peculiarly cinematic element of narrative . 
there still remain the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art . 
the man be person . 
when he come to the movie - more_or_less by accident - they be still cheap entertainment capable of enthrall the unthinking for an idle few minute . 
in about seven year person either invent or first realize the possibility of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film_maker . 
before he be forty person had create the art of the film . 
not that there had not be attempt , mostly european , to do exactly that . 
but in_general the european effort to make an art of the entertainment had ignore the slowly emerge language of the film itself . 
staggeringly condensed version of famous novel and famous play were present . 
great actor and actress - the most notable be person - were hire to repeat their stage performance before the camera . 
in all_of this extensive and expensive effort , the camera was downgrade to the status of recording instrument for art produce elsewhere by the actor or by the author . 
the phonograph today , for all its high_fidelity and stereophonic sound , be precisely what the early art purveyor in the movie wish to make of the camera . 
not surprisingly , this approach did not work . 
the effort produce a valuable record of stage technique in the early year of the century and some interesting record of great theater figure who would otherwise be only name . 
but no art at_all be_born of the art effort in the early movie . 
northern liberal be the chief supporter of civil_rights and of integration . 
they have also lead the nation in the direction of a welfare_state . 
and both in their objective of non-discrimination and of social progress they have had range against them the southerner who are called bourbon . 
the name presumably derive from the french royal_house which never learn and never forget ; since bourbon whiskey , though of kentucky origin , be at_least as much favored by liberal in the north as by conservative in the south . 
the nature of the opposition between liberal and bourbon is too little understand in the north . 
the race_problem has tend to obscure other , less emotional , issue which may fundamentally be even more divisive . 
it be these other difference between north and south - other_than , that_is , than those which concern discrimination or social_welfare - which i chiefly discuss herein . 
i write about northern liberal from considerable personal experience . 
a southerner marry to a new_englander , i have live for many year in a connecticut commuting town with a high percentage of artist , writer , publicity_man , and business_executive of egghead taste . 
most_of them be democrat and nearly all consider themselves , and are view_as , liberal . 
this be puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism , because it be clear that these democrat who be left-of-center be at opposite pole from the liberal person , who hold that the best government be the least government . 
yet paradoxically my liberal friend continue to view person as one of their patron_saint . 
when i question them as_to what they mean by concept like liberty and democracy , i find that they fall_into two category : the simple ones who have simply accept the shibboleth of their faith without analysis ; and the intelligent , cynical ones who scornfully reply that these thing do n't count anymore in the world of today . 
i be naive , they say , to make use of such word . 
i take this to mean that the intelligent - and therefore necessarily cynical ? 
- liberal consider that the need for a national economy with control that will assure his conception of social justice be so great that individual and local liberty as_well_as democratic process may have to yield before it . 
this seem like an attitude favor a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which , under a president of the same stamp , would try to coerce an uncooperative congress or supreme_court . 
as for state ' right , they have never count in the thinking of my liberal friend except as irritation of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronism . 
the american liberal may , in the world of today , have a strong case ; but he present it publicly so enmesh in hypocrisy that it be not an honest one . 
why , in_the_first_place , call himself a liberal if he be against laissez_faire and favor an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb control over everybody ? 
if he attach little importance to personal liberty , why not make this known to the world ? 
and if he be so scornful of the right of state , why not advocate a different sort of constitution that he could more sincerely support ? 
i am concern here , however , with the northern liberal 's attitude toward the south . 
it appear to be one of intense dislike , which he make little effort to conceal even in the presence of southern friend . 
his assumption seem to be that any such friend , be tolerable human , must be more liberal than most southerner and therefore at_least partly in_sympathy_with his view . 
group 's editor , person , in his book , the waist high culture , write : `` most of what be different about it ( the deep_south ) i find myself unsympathetic to '' . 
this , for the liberal i know , would be an understatement . 
theirs be no mere lack of sympathy , but something close to the passionate hatred that was direct against fascism . 
i do not think that my experience would be typical for southerner live in the north . 
in business circle , usually conservative , this sort of atmosphere would hardly be find . 
but in our case - and neither my wife nor i have extreme view on integration , nor be we given to emotional outburst - the situation has ruin one or two valued friendship and come_close to wreck several more . 
in_fact it has cause us to give serious thought to move our residence south , because it be not easy for the most objective southerner to sit_by calmly by when his host is tell a roomful of people that the only way to deal with southerner who oppose integration be to send in troops and shoot the bastard down . 
account have been publish of northern liberal in the south up_against segregationist prejudice , especially in state-supported university where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view . 
but these account do not show that northerner have been subject to embarrassment or provocation by yankee hatred display in social gathering . 
from my wife 's experience and other source , this seem to be rarely encounter in educated circle . 
the strong feeling is certainly there ; but there be a leavening of liberalism among college graduate throughout the south , especially among those who study in the north . 
and social_relation arise out of business tie impose courtesy , if not sympathy , toward resident and visit northerner . 
also , among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent southern attitude on most social problem . 
there be of_course many south ; but for this discussion the most important division be between those who have been reconstruct and those who have n't . 
my definition of this much abused adjective be that a reconstructed rebel be one who be glad that the north win the war . 
nobody know how many southerner there be in this category . 
i suspect that there be far more unreconstructed ones than the north like to believe . 
i never hear of a poll being take on the question . 
no_doubt such a thing would be consider unpatriotic . 
prior to 1954 i imagine that a majority of southerner would have vote against the confederacy . 
since the supreme_court 's decision of that year this be more doubtful ; and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to little_rock i believe the majority would have be for the old_south . 
belief in the traditional way_of_life persist much more in the old state than in the new ones . 
probably a large percentage of virginian and south_carolinian remain unreconstructed than elsewhere , with georgia , north_carolina , and alabama follow along after them . 
old attitude are hold more tenaciously in the tidewater than the piedmont ; so_that a line run down the length of the south mark the upper_limit of tidewater would roughly divide the old_south from the new , but with , of_course , important minority enclave . 
the long settled area of state like virginia and south_carolina develop the antebellum culture to its rich flowering , and there the memory be more precious , and the consciousness of loss the great . 
also , we should not even today discount the fact that a region such_as the coastal lowland center_on charleston have close tie with england and the west_indies than with the north even after independence . 
the social and psychological consequence of this continue to affect the area . 
in certain respect defeat increase the persistent anglophilia of the old_south . 
poor where they had once be rich , humble where they had be arrogant , have no_longer any hope of share_in the leadership of the nation , the rebel who would not surrender in spirit draw comfort from the sympathy they feel extend to them by the mother_country . 
and no_doubt many people in state like the location and georgia , which be among the most tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regret the revolt against the crown . 
among bourbon the racial issue may have less to do with their remain unreconstructed than other factor . 
all southerner agree that slavery had to go ; but many historian maintain that except for northern meddling it would have end in state like virginia year before it did . 
southern resentment has be over the method of its ending , the invasion , and reconstruction ; their fear now be of miscegenation and negro political control in many county . 
but apart from racial problem , the old unreconstructed south - to use the moderate word favored by person - find itself unsympathetic to most of what be different about the civilization of the north . 
and this , in_effect , mean most of modern america . 
it be hard to see how the situation could be otherwise . 
and therein , i feel , many northerner delude themselves about the south . 
for_one_thing , this be not a subject often discuss or analyze . 
there seem to be almost a conspiracy of silence veil it . 
i suppose the reason be a kind of wishful_thinking : do n't talk_about the final stage of reconstruction and they will take_care of themselves . 
or_else the north really believe that all southerner except a_few quaint old character have come_around to realize the error of their past , and be now at_heart sharer of the american_dream , like everybody else . 
if the circumstance are face frankly it be not reasonable to expect this to be true . 
the situation of the south since 1865 has be unique in the western world . 
regardless_of right and wrong , a population and an area appropriate to a pre world_war_i , great_power have been , following conquest , rule against their will by a neighboring people , and have had impose upon them social and economic control they dislike . 
and the great majority of these people be of anglo-saxon or celtic descent . 
this be the only case in modern history of a_people of britannic origin submit without continued struggle to what they view_as foreign domination . 
the fact be_due mainly to international war , both hot_war and cold_war . 
in every war of the united_states since the civil_war the south be more belligerent than the rest of the country . 
so instead of be test of the south 's loyalty , the spanish-american_war , the two world_war , and the korean_war all serve to overcome old grievance and cement reunion . 
and there be no section of the nation more ardent than the south in the cold_war against communism . 
had the situation been reverse , had , for_instance , england be the enemy in 1898 because of issue of concern chiefly to new_england , there be little doubt that large_number of southerner would have happily put_on their old confederate uniform to fight as ally of britain . 
it be extraordinary that a_people as proud and warlike as southerner should have be as docile as they have . 
the north should thank_its_stars that such has be the case ; but at_the_same_time it should not draw false inference therefrom . 
the two main charge level against the bourbon by liberal be that they be racist and social reactionary . 
there be much truth in both these charge , and not many bourbon deny them . 
whatever their fault , they be not hypocrite . 
most_of them sincerely believe that the anglo-saxon be the best race in the world and that it should remain pure . 
many northerner believe this , too , but few of them will say so publicly . 
the bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , be not very different from that of northern conservative . 
but those among the bourbon who remain unreconstructed go much further than this . 
they believe that if the south had been let_alone it would have produce a civilization superior to that of modern america . 
as_it_is , they consider that the north is now reap the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in_spite_of its high standard_of_living the `` american way '' has been prove inferior to the english and scandinavian way , although they disapprove of the socialistic feature of the latter . 
the south 's antipathy to northern civilization include such charge as poor manners , harsh accent , lack of appreciation of the art of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure . 
their own easy , slow tempo be especially dear to southerner ; and i have hear many say that they be content to earn a half or a third as_much_as they could up north because they so much prefer the quiet habit of their hometown . 
as cell coalesce into organism , they build new `` unnatural '' and internally control environment to cope even more successfully with the entropy increasing property of the external world . 
the useful suggestion of person which consider culture as a third stage in biological evolution fit quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provide us with a rather successful technique for build protective artificial environment . 
one wonder about its applicability to people . 
will advance in human science help us build social_structure and government which will enable us to cope_with people as_effectively_as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic_acid build a structure of molecule which enable it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ? 
the answer be of_course yes . 
for the family be the simple example of just such a unit , compose of people , which give us both some immunity from , and a way of deal with , other people . 
social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await person or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulation of person . 
but it has been during the last two century , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has make the most rapid stride . 
we have ample light when the sun set ; the temperature of our home be independent of the season ; we fly through the air , although gravity pull us down ; the range of our voice ignore distance . 
at what stage be social_science then ? 
be the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of newton ? 
there be a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in person and in freud . 
and it be certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievement and their impact . 
political theoretical understanding , although almost at a standstill during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth century , and result in a flood of invention which increase the possibility for man to coexist with man . 
constitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor_union , cooperative , commune , socialized ownership , world_court , and the veto power in world_council be but a_few example . 
most_of these , with horrible exception , were conceive as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it . 
the most effective political invention seem to make maximum use of natural harbor and be aware that restrain breakwater can play only a minor part in the whole scheme . 
just as present technology had to await the explanation of physics , so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding . 
we be desperately in the need of such invention , for man be still very_much at the mercy of man . 
in_fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is day_by_day increase our fear of each other . 
i want , therefore , to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science , the connection between scientific understanding and fear . 
there be certainly large area of understanding in the human science which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fear . 
person has remark : `` the reason why all mortal are so grip by fear be that they see all sort of thing happen in the earth and sky with no discernable cause , and these they attribute to the will of god '' . 
perhaps thing be even worse then . 
it be difficult to reconstruct the primeval fear of man . 
we get some clue from a_few remembrance of childhood and from the circumstance that we be probably not much more afraid of people now than man ever be . 
we be not now afraid of atomic_bomb in the same way that people once fear comet . 
the bomb be as_harmless_as an automobile in a garage . 
we be worried about what people may do with them - that some crazy fool may `` push the button '' . 
i be certainly not adequately train to describe or enlarge on human fear , but there be certain feature of the fear dispel by scientific explanation that stand_out quite clearly . 
they be in_general those fear that once seem to have be amenable to prayer or ritual . 
they include both individual fear and collective ones . 
they arise in situation in which one believe that what happen depend not_only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group . 
often it is recognize that all the detail of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determine and not develop through theoretical understanding , one be never quite certain which behavior element be effective , and the whole pattern become ritualize . 
yet often fear persist because , even with the most rigid ritual , one be never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had be unaware of the really decisive act . 
to say that science had reduce many such fear merely reiterate the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminate much of magic and superstition . 
but a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating . 
the frequently postulate antique worry that the daylight hour might dwindle to complete darkness apparently give_rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize . 
it be curious that even century of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremony of the winter_solstice . 
this and other fear of the solar_system have disappear gradually , first , with the ptolemaic_system and its built-in concept of periodicity and_then , more firmly , with the newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account_for quantitatively for both terrestrial and celestial motion . 
this understanding provide a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without institute any control . 
in_fact , although we have dispel the fear , we have not necessarily assure ourselves that there be no danger . 
there be still the remote possibility of planetoid collision . 
a meteor could fall on san_francisco . 
solar activity could presumably bring long period of flood or drought . 
our understanding of the solar_system has teach us to replace our former elaborate ritual with the appropriate action which , in this case , amount to do nothing . 
yet we no_longer feel uneasy . 
this almost trivial example be nevertheless suggestive , for there be some element in_common between the antique fear that the day would get short and short and our present fear of war . 
we , in our country , think_of war as an external threat which , if it occur , will not be primarily of our own doing . 
and yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depend in some obscure or at_least uncertain way on the detail of how we behave . 
what element of our behavior be decisive ? 
our weapon production , our world prestige , our idea of democracy , our action of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage ? 
we have stave_off a war and , since our behavior has involve all these element , we can only keep add to our ritual without dare to abandon any part of_it , since we have not the slight notion which part be effective . 
i think that we are here also talk_about the kind of fear that a young boy have for a group of boy who are approach at night along the street of a large city . 
if an automobile were approach him , he would know what was require of him , even_though he might not be able to act quickly enough . 
with the group of boy it be different . 
he does not know whether to look up or look aside , to put his hand in his pocket or to clench them at his side , to cross the street , or to continue on the same side . 
when confront with a drunk or an insane person i have no notion of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others . 
i believe that what i do have some effect on his action and i have learn , in_a_way , to commune with drunk , but certainly my action seem to resemble more nearly the performance of a rain_dance than the carry_out of an experiment in physics . 
i am usually fill with an uneasiness that through some unwitting slip all hell may break_loose . 
our inability to explain why certain people be fond of us frequently induce the same kind of ritual and malaise . 
we are force , in our behavior towards others , to adopt empirically successful pattern in_toto because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential element . 
our collective policy , group and national , are similarly base on voodoo , but here we often lack even the empirically successful ritual and are still engage in determine them . 
we use term from our personal experience with individual such_as `` trust '' , `` cheat '' , and `` get_tough '' . 
we talk_about national character in the same way that person talk of the compulsion of celestial_body to move in circle . 
we perform elaborate international exhortation and ceremony with virtually no understanding of social cause and effect . 
small wonder , then , that we fear . 
the achievement which dispel our fear of the cosmos take_place three century ago . 
what additional role has the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th century play ? 
in the physical_science , these achievement concern electricity , chemistry , and atomic_physics . 
in the life_science , there has be an enormous increase in our understanding of disease , in the mechanism of heredity , and in biological - and physiological chemistry . 
the major effect of these advance appear to lie_in the part they have play in the industrial_revolution and in the tool which scientific understanding has give us to build and manipulate a more protective environment . 
in_addition , our way of deal directly with natural_phenomenon has also change . 
even in domain where detailed and predictive understanding be still lack , but where some explanation be possible , as with lightning and weather and earthquake , the appropriate kind of human_action has been more adequately indicate . 
apparently the population as_a_whole eventually acquire enough confidence in the explanation of the scientist to modify its procedure and its fear . 
how and why this process occur would provide an interesting separate subject for study . 
in some area , the progress be slow than in others . 
in agriculture , for_example , despite the advance in biology , elaborate ritual tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence of some natural disaster . 
in child_care , the opposite extreme prevail ; procedure change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceed anything warrant by established psychological theory . 
there be many domain in which understanding has bring_about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear . 
much of the former extreme uneasiness associate with vision and hallucination and with death has disappear . 
the persistent horror of have a malformed child has , i believe , been reduce , not because we have gain any control over this misfortune , but precisely because we have learn that we have so little control over it . 
in_fact , the recent warning about the use of x_ray have introduce fear and ambiguity of action which now require more detailed understanding , and thus in_this instance , science has momentarily aggravate our fear . 
in_fact , insofar as science generate any fear , it stem not so much from scientific prowess and gadget but from the fact that new unanswered question arise , which , until they are understand , create uncertainty . 
perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derive from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease . 
the situation with regard_to our attitude and `` control '' of disease contain close analogy to problem confront us with_respect_to people . 
the fear of disease be formerly very_much the kind of fear i have try to describe . 
it is worth dwell in some detail on the crisis of this story , because it bring_together a number of characteristic element and make of them a curious , riddle compound obscurely but centrally significant for person 's work . 
the wife , person , and her lover are both savagely portray , she as incarnate sensuality , `` voluptuous '' and `` indolent '' , possibly `` a mischief maker '' , with `` a kind of luxurious cunning '' to set against her apparent simplicity , her `` bird like brain '' . 
person , for his part , `` belong_to the present-day race of small artist , who do not demand the utmost of themselves '' , and the bitter description of the type include such epithet as `` wretched little poseur '' , the devastating indictment `` they do not know how to be wretched decently and in_order '' , and the somewhat extreme prophecy , so_far not fulfill : `` they will be destroy '' . 
the trick these two play upon person reveal their want not simply of decency but of imagination as_well . 
his appearance as person evoke not amusement but horror in the audience ; it be a spectacle absolutely painful , an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit , untouched by any spirit other_than abasement and humiliation . 
at_the_same_time the multiple transvestitism involve - the fat man as girl and as baby , as coquette pretend to be a baby - touch_on for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret source of a life like person 's , upon the sinister dream which form the source of any human life . 
the music which person has compose for this episode be for_the_most_part `` rather pretty and perfectly banal '' . 
but it be characteristic of him , we are tell , `` his little artifice '' , to be able to introduce `` into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art '' . 
and this occur now , at the refrain of person 's song - at the point , in_fact , of the name `` person '' - ; a modulation describe as `` almost a stroke of genius '' . 
`` a miracle , a revelation , it be like a curtain suddenly tear_away to reveal something nude '' . 
it is this modulation which reveal to person his own frightful abjection and , simultaneously , his wife 's infidelity . 
by the same means he perceive this fact as having communicate itself to the audience ; he collapse , and die . 
in the work of every artist , i suppose , there may be find one or more moment which strike the student as absolutely decisive , ultimately emblematic of what it be all about ; not less strikingly so for be mysterious , as though some deeply hidden constatation of thought were encipher in a single image , a single moment . 
so here . 
the horrifying humor , the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke go_wrong , the monstrous image of the fat man dress_up as a whore dress_up as a baby ; the epiphany of that quivering flesh ; the bring_together around it of the secret liaison between indolent , mindless sensuality and sharp , shrewd talent , cleverness with an occasional touch of genius ( which , however , does not know `` how to attack the problem of suffering '' ) ; the miraculous way in which music , revelation and death are associate in a single instant - all this seem a triumph of art , a rather desperate art , in itself ; beyond itself , also , it evoke numerous and distant resonance from the entire body of person 's work . 
when i try to work_out my reason for feel that this passage be of critical significance , i come_up with the following idea , which i shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay . 
love be the crucial dilemma of experience for person 's hero . 
the dramatic construction of his story characteristically turn_on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compel and forbid to love . 
the release , the freedom , involve in love another be either terribly difficult or_else absolutely impossible ; and the motion toward it bring disaster . 
this prohibition on love have an especially poignant relation to art ; it is particularly the artist ( person , person , person ) who suffer from it . 
the specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem of the `` breakthrough '' in the realm of art . 
again , the suffering and disaster produce by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood , with the figure of a child . 
finally , the theatrical ( and perversely erotic ) notion of dress_up , cosmetics , disguise , and especially change of costume ( or singularity of costume , as with person ) , are characteristically associate with the catastrophe of person 's story . 
we shall return to these statement and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulate . 
for the present it be enough to note that in the grotesque figure of person , at the moment of his collapse , all these element come together in prophetic parody . 
professionally a lawyer , that_is_to_say associated with dignity , reserve , discipline , with much that be essentially middle-class , he is compel by an impossible love to exhibit himself dress_up , disguised - that_is , paradoxically , reveal - as a child , and , worse , as a whore masquerade as a child . 
that this abandonment take_place on a stage , during an ' artistic ' performance , be enough to associate person with art , and to bring_down upon him the punishment for art ; that_is , he be suspect , guilty , punishable , as be anyone in person 's story who produce illusion , and this be true even_though the constant element of the artist nature , technique , magic , guilt and suffering , are divided in this story between person and person . 
it appear that the dominant tendency of person 's early tale , however pictorial or even picturesque the surface , be already toward the symbolic , the emblematic , the expressionistic . 
in a certain perfectly definite way , the method and the theme of his story be one_and_the_same . 
something of this can be learn from `` the_way_to_the_churchyard '' ( 1901 ) , an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist cause him to die of a stroke or seizure . 
there be no_more `` plot '' than that ; only slightly more , perhaps , than a newspaper account of such an incident would give . 
the artistic interest , then , lie_in what the encounter may be make to represent , in the power of some central significance to draw the detail into relevance and meaningfulness . 
the first sentence , with its platitudinous irony , announce an emblematic intent : `` the way to the churchyard run_along beside the highroad , run beside it all_the_way to the end ; that_is_to_say , to the churchyard '' . 
and the action is consistently present with regard for this distinction . 
the highroad , one might say at_first , belong_to life , while the way to the churchyard belong_to death . 
but that is too simple , and won't hold_up . 
as the first sentence suggest , both road belong_to death in_the_end . 
but the highroad , according_to the description of its traffic , belong_to life as it is live in unawareness of death , while the way to the churchyard belong_to some other sort of life : 
a suffering form , an existence wholly comprise in the awareness of death . 
thus , on the highroad , a troop of soldier `` march in their own dust and sing '' , while on the footpath one man walk alone . 
this man 's isolation be not merely momentary , it be permanent . 
he be a widower , his three child be dead , he have no_one leave on earth ; also he be a drunk , and has lose his job on_that_account . 
his name be person , and he is rather fully describe as_to his clothing and physiognomy in_a_way which relate him to a sinister type in the author 's repertory - he be a forerunner of those enigmatic stranger in `` death_in_venice '' , for_example , who represent some combination of cadaver , exotic , and psychopomp . 
this strange person quarrel with a cyclist because the latter is use the path rather_than the highroad . 
the cyclist , a sufficiently commonplace young fellow , is not name but identify simply as `` person '' - that and a license_number , which person use in address him . 
`` person '' point_out that `` everybody use this path '' , and start to ride on . 
person try to stop him by force , receive a push in the chest from `` person '' , and is leave stand in impotent and growing rage , while a crowd begin to gather . 
his rage assume a religious form ; that_is , on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness , person become a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of god imprecate doom on person - not_only the cyclist now , but the audience , the world , as_well : `` all you light-headed breed '' . 
this passion bring_on a fit which prove fatal . 
then an ambulance come_along , and they drive person away . 
this be simple enough , but several more point of interest may be mention as relevant . 
the season , between spring and summer , belong_to life in its carefree aspect . 
person 's fatal rage arise not_only because he cannot stop the cyclist , but also because god will not stop him ; as location say to the crowd in his last moment : `` his justice be not of this world '' . 
person is further characterize , in antithesis to person , as animal : the image of a dog , which appear at several place , is first give as the criterion of amiable , irrelevant interest arouse by life consider simply as a spectacle : a dog in a wagon be `` admirable '' , `` a pleasure to contemplate '' ; another wagon have no dog , and therefore be `` devoid_of interest '' . 
person call the cyclist `` cur '' and `` puppy '' among other thing , and at the crisis of his fit a little fox_terrier stand before him and howl into his face . 
the ambulance is draw by two `` charming '' little horse . 
person be not , certainly , religious in any conventional sense . 
his religiousness is intimately , or dialectically , connected with his sinfulness ; the two may in_fact be identical . 
his unsuccessful striving to give_up drink are represent as religious striving ; he keep a bottle in a wardrobe at home , and `` before this wardrobe person had before now go literally on his knee , and in his wrestling had bite his tongue - and still in_the_end capitulate '' . 
the cyclist , by contrast , blond and blue-eyed , be simply unreflective , unproblematic person , `` blithe and carefree '' . 
`` he make no claim to belong_to the great and mighty of this earth '' . 
person be grotesque , a disturbing parody ; his end be ridiculous and trivial . 
he be `` a man raving_mad on_the_way to the churchyard '' . 
but he be more interesting than the others , the ones who come from the highroad to watch him , more interesting than person consider as a cyclist . 
and if i have go into so much detail about so small a work , that is because it be also so typical a work , represent the germinal form of a conflict which remain essential in person 's writing : 
the crude sketch of person contain , in its critical , destructive and self-destructive tendency , much that is enlarge and illuminate in the figure of , for_instance , person and person . 
in method as_well_as in theme this little anecdote with its detail select as much for expressiveness and allegory as for `` realism '' , anticipate a kind of musical_composition , as_well as a kind of fictional composition , in which , as person say , `` there shall be nothing unthematic '' . 
it resemble , too , picture such_as person and person do , in which all that look at_first to be solely pictorial prove on inspection to be also literary , the representation of a proverb , for_example , or a deadly_sin . 
`` gladius_dei '' ( 1902 ) resemble `` the_way_to_the_churchyard '' in its representation of a conflict between light and dark , between `` person '' and a spirit of criticism , negation , melancholy , but it go considerably further in characterize the element of this conflict . 
the monk person , bring over from the renaissance and place against the background of munich at the turn_of_the_century , protest against the luxurious work display in the art shop of person ; in particular against a person portray in a voluptuous style and model , according_to gossip , upon the painter 's mistress . 
person , like person , make his protest quite in_vain , and his rejection , though not fatal , be ridiculous and humiliating ; he is simply throw_out of the shop by the porter . 
on the street outside , person envision a holocaust of the vanity of this world , such a burning of artistic and erotic production as his namesake actually bring to pass in florence , and prophetically he issue his curse : `` gladius_dei super terram cito et velociter '' .

it has recently become practical to use the radio_emission of the moon and planet as a new source of information about these heavenly_body and their atmosphere . 
the result of present observation of the thermal radio_emission of the moon be consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derive from the variation in the infrared_emission during eclipse ( e.g. , person , 1958 ) . 
when sufficiently accurate and complete measurement be available , it will be possible to set limit on the thermal and electrical characteristic of the surface and subsurface material of the moon . 
observation of the radio_emission of a planet which have an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to_a_greater_extent than those use short wavelength and should in some case give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristic of the solid surface . 
radio_observation of venus and jupiter have already supply unexpected experimental data on the physical condition of these planet . 
the observed intensity of the radio_emission of venus be much high than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicate by measurement at wavelength near 3 cm and 10 cm be like that of a blackbody at about 600 ` k . 
this result suggest a very high_temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there be the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non thermal component and that the observed spectrum be that of a blackbody merely by coincidence . 
for the case of jupiter , the radio_emission spectrum be definitely not like the spectrum of a blackbody radiator , and it seem very likely that the radiation reach the earth be a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non thermal component . 
of the remaining planet , only mars and saturn have been observe as radio_source , and not very much information be available . 
mars has been observe twice at about 3 - cm wavelength , and the intensity of the observed radiation be in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predict on the basis of the known temperature of mars . 
the low intensity of the radiation from saturn has limited observation , but again the measured radiation seem to be consistent with a thermal origin . 
no attempt to measure the radio_emission of the remaining planet have been report , and , because of their distance , small diameter , or low_temperature , the thermal radiation at radio wavelength reach the earth from these source is expect to be of very low intensity . 
in_spite of this , the very large radio_reflector and improve amplify technique which are now become available should make it possible to observe the radio_emission of most of the planet in a_few year . 
the study of the radio_emission of the moon and planet begin with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at 1.25 - cm wavelength by person and person ( 1946 ) . 
this was follow by a comprehensive series of observation of the 1.25 - cm emission of the moon over three lunar cycle by person and person ( 1949 ) . 
they deduce from their measurement that the radio_emission from the whole disk of the moon vary during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion ; that the amplitude of the variation be considerably less_than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared_emission as measure by person and person ( 1930 ) and person ( 1935 ) ; and that the maximum of the radio_emission come about 3 - 1 2 day after full_moon , which be again in contrast to the infrared_emission , which reach its maximum at full_moon . 
person and person explain their observation by pointing_out that rocklike material which be likely to make_up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio_wave , although opaque to infrared_radiation . 
the infrared_emission could then be assume to originate at the surface of the moon , while the radio_emission originate at some depth beneath the surface , where the temperature variation due_to solar_radiation is reduce in amplitude and shift in phase . 
since the absorption of radio_wave in rocklike material vary with wavelength , it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depth beneath the surface and possibly detect change in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material . 
the radio_emission of a planet was first detect in 1955 , when person and person ( 1955 ) identify the origin of interference like radio_noise on their record at about 15 meter wavelength as emission from jupiter . 
this sporadic type of planetary radiation is discuss by person ( chap. 13 ) and person ( chap. 14 ) . 
steady radiation which be presumably of thermal origin was observe from venus at 3.15 and 9.4 cm , and from mars and jupiter at 3.15 cm in 1956 ( person , person , and person , 1958 a , b , c ) , and from saturn at 3.75 cm in 1957 ( person and person , 1958 ) . 
in the relatively short time since these early observation , venus has been observe at additional wavelength in the range from 0.8 to 10.2 cm , and jupiter has been observe over the wavelength range from 3.03 to 68 cm . 
the observable characteristic of planetary radio_radiation be the intensity , the polarization , and the direction of arrival of the wave . 
the maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk as observe from the earth be about 1 minute_of_arc . 
this be much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large reflector now under construction , and consequently the radio_emission of different region of the disk cannot be resolve . 
it should be possible , however , to put useful limit on the diameter of the radio_source by observe with large reflector or with interferometer . 
measurement of polarization are presently limit by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth . 
there have be few measurement specifically for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation . 
the measurement make with the nrl 50 - foot reflector , which is altitude azimuth mounted , would have show a systematic change with local hour_angle in the measured intensity of venus and jupiter if a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly polarize . 
recent interferometer measurement ( person and person , 1960 ) have show the 960 - mc emission of jupiter to be partially polarize and to originate_in a region of larger diameter than the visible disk . 
other_than this very significant result , most_of the information now available about the radio_emission of the planet is restrict to the intensity of the radiation . 
the concept of apparent blackbody temperature is use to describe the radiation receive from the moon and the planet . 
the receive radiation is compare with the radiation from a hypothetical blackbody which subtend the same solid_angle as the visible disk of the planet . 
the apparent blackbody disk temperature be the temperature which must be assume for the blackbody in_order_that the intensity of its radiation should equal that of the observed radiation . 
the use of this concept does not specify the origin of the radiation , and only if the planet really radiate as a blackbody , will the apparent blackbody temperature correspond to the physical temperature of the emitting material . 
the radio_radiation of the sun which is reflect from the moon and planet should be negligible compare with their thermal_emission at centimeter wavelength , except possibly at time of exceptional outburst of solar radio_noise . 
the quiescent level of centimeter wavelength solar_radiation would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less than 1 ` k . 
at meter wavelength and increase of the order of 10 ` k in the average disk temperature of the near planet would be expect . 
therefore , neglect the extreme outburst , reflect solar_radiation is not expect to cause sizable error in the measurement of planetary radiation in the centimeter - and decimeter wavelength range . 
radio_observation of the moon have been made over the range of wavelength from 4.3 mm to 75 cm , and the result are summarize in table 1 . 
observation have also been make at 1.5 mm use optical technique ( person , 1955 , 1956 , ; see_also chap. 11 ) . 
not all the observer have use the same procedure or make the same assumption about the lunar brightness distribution when reduce the data , and this , together with difference in the method of calibrate the antenna and receiver , must account_for much of the disagreement in the measured radio_brightness temperature . 
in the observation at 4.3 mm ( person , 1959 a ) , the diameter of the antenna beam , 6 ' .7 , be small enough to allow resolution of some of the larger feature of the lunar surface , and contour diagram have been make of the lunar brightness distribution at three lunar phase . 
these observation indicate that the lunar maria heat_up more rapidly and also cool_off more rapidly than do the mountainous region . 
location seem to be an exception and remain cool than the region which surround it . 
these contour diagram also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio_brightness with latitude . 
very recently , observation have been make at 8 - mm wavelength with a reflector 22 meter in diameter with a resultant beam width of only about 2 ' ( person , person , and person , 1960 ) . 
the constant temperature contour be much smooth than those observe at 4.3 mm by person ( 1959 a ) , and apparently the emission at 8 mm be not nearly so sensitive to difference in surface feature . 
such high-resolution observation as these are needed at several wavelength in_order_that the radio_emission of the moon can be properly interpret . 
the observation of person , person , and person at 3.15 cm and of person at 10.3 cm have not previously been publish and will be briefly describe . 
measurement at 3.15 cm be obtain on 11 day spread over the interval may 3 to june 19 , 1956 , use the 50 - foot reflector at the group in location . 
the half-intensity diameter of the antenna beam be about 9 ' , and the angle subtend by the moon include the entire main beam and part of the first side lobe . 
the antenna pattern and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both measure ( person , person , and person , 1958 b ) , so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid_angle of the moon was know . 
the ratio of the measured antenna temperature_change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam ( assume that the brightness temperature of the sky be negligible ) was find , by graphical integration of the antenna directivity diagram , to be 0.85 . 
the measured brightness temperature be a good approximation to the brightness temperature at the center of the lunar disk because of the narrow antenna beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion of the moon 's disk be nearly uniform . 
the result of the observation be ( in ` k ) **f where the phase angle , |qt , is measure in degree from new_moon and the probable error include absolute as_well_as relative error . 
this result is plot along with the 8.6 - mm observation of person ( 1958 ) in figure 1 , a . 
the variation in the 3 - cm emission of the moon during a lunation be very_much less_than the variation in the 8.6 - mm emission , as would be expect from the explanation of person and person ( 1949 ) . 
in the discussion which follow , the time average of the radio_emission will be refer to as the constant component , and the superimposed periodic variation will be called the variable component . 
the 10.3 - cm observation of person was make on may 20 , 1958 , use the 84 - foot reflector at the group of the group . 
the age of the moon be about 2 day . 
the half-intensity diameter of the main lobe of the antenna be about 18 ' .5 , and the brightness temperature was reduce by assume a gaussian_shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for the moon . 
experiment were make on an electric arc apply a porous graphite anode cool by a transpiring gas ( argon ) . 
thus , the energy transfer from the arc to the anode was partly feed back into the arc . 
it be show that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduce to approximately 15  of the total arc energy a detailed energy balance of the anode was establish . 
the anode ablation could be reduce to a negligible amount . 
the dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirate gas was investigate for various arc length and current between 100 amp and 200 amp . 
qualitative observation were make and high-speed motion_picture were take to study flow phenomenon in the arc at various mass flow velocity . 
the high heat flux exist at the electrode surface of electric arc necessitate extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation . 
the cooling requirement be particularly severe at the anode . 
in free_burning electric arc , for_instance , approximately 90  of the total arc power is transfer to the anode give_rise to local heat flux in excess of **f as measure by the author - the exact value depending_on the arc atmosphere . 
in plasma generator as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high_temperature research tool often more than 50  of the total energy input is being transfer to the cooling medium of the anode . 
the high heat transfer rate at the anode compare with those at the cathode can be explain by the physical_phenomenon occur in free_burning arc . 
in plasma generator the superimposed forced convection may modify the picture somewhat . 
the heat transfer to the anode be_due to the following effect : 1 . 
heat_of_condensation ( work function ) plus kinetic_energy of the electron impinge_on the anode . 
this energy transfer depend_on the current , the temperature in the arc column , the anode material , and the condition in the anode sheath . 
2 . 
heat transfer by molecular conduction as_well_as by radiation from the arc column . 
the heat transfer to the anode in free_burning arc is enhance by a hot gas_jet flow from the cathode towards the anode with velocity up **f . 
this phenomenon has been experimentally investigate in_detail by person ( reference 1 ) . 
the pressure gradient produce the gas_jet be_due to the nature of the magnetic_field in the arc ( rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode ) . 
hence , the flow condition at the anode of free_burning arc resemble those near a stagnation point . 
it be apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirement for the anode of free_burning arc be large compare with those for the cathode . 
the gas flow through a plasma generator will modify these condition ; however , the anode be still the part receive the largest heat flux . 
an attempt to improve the life of the anode or the efficiency of the plasma generator must , therefore , aim at a reduction of the anode loss . 
the following possibility exist for achieve this : 1 . 
the use of high voltage and low current by proper design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given power output . 
2 . 
continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode by flow or magnetic_force . 
3 . 
feedback of the energy transfer to the anode by apply gas transpiration through the anode . 
the third method was , to our knowledge , successfully apply for_the_first_time by person and co-worker ( reference 2 ) . 
the purpose of the present study is to study the thermal condition and to establish an energy balance for a transpiration cooled anode as_well_as the effect of blowing on the arc voltage . 
gas injection through a porous anode ( transpiration cooling ) not_only feed_back the energy transfer to the anode by the above mention process , but also modify the condition in the arc itself . 
a detailed study of this latter phenomenon was not attempt in this paper . 
argon was use as a blowing_gas to exclude any effect of dissociation or chemical_reaction . 
the anode material be porous graphite . 
sintered porous metal should be usable in_principle . 
however , technical difficulty arise by melting at local hot spot . 
the experimental arrangement as describe below be based on the geometry of free_burning arc . 
thus , direct comparison can be draw with free_burning arc which have been study in_detail during the past year and decade by numerous investigator ( reference 3 ) . 
figure 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic view of the test stand and of two different model of the anode holder . 
the cathode consist_of a 1/4 '' diameter thoriated tungsten rod attached to a water-cooled copper tube . 
this tube could be adjust in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the required electrode spacing . 
the anode in figure 2 was mount by means of the anode holder which was attach to a steel plug and disk . 
the transpiring gas eject from the anode form a jet directed axially towards the cathode below . 
inflow of air from the surrounding atmosphere was prevent by the two disk show in figure 2 . 
argon was also blow at low velocity ( mass flow_rate **f ) through a tube coaxial with the cathode as an additional precaution against contamination of the arc by air . 
the anode consist_of a 1/2 inch diameter porous graphite plug , 1/4 inch long . 
the graphite be national_carbon_nc 60 , which have a porosity of 50  and an average pore size of 30 this small pore size was require to ensure uniformity of the flow leave the anode . 
the anode plug ( figure 2 ) was insert into a carbon anode holder . 
a shielded thermocouple was use to measure the upstream temperature of the transpiring gas . 
it was expose to a high velocity gas_jet . 
a plug and a tube with hole in its cylindrical wall divide the chamber above the porous plug into two part . 
this arrangement have the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by natural convection . 
two pyrometer show in figure 1 and 2 ( group model 95 ) serve for simultaneous measurement of the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along the anode holder . 
three thermocouple were place at different location in the aluminum disk surround the anode holder to determine its temperature . 
another anode holder use in the experiment is show in figure 3 . 
in this design the anode holder be water-cooled and the heat loss by conduction from the anode were determine by measure the temperature rise of the coolant . 
to reduce heat transfer from the hot gas to this anode holder outside the region of the arc , a carbon shield was attach to the surface provide an air gap of 1/16 inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder . 
in_addition , the inner surface of the carbon shield was cover with aluminum_foil to reduce radiation . 
temperature of the shield and of the surface of the water-cooled anode holder were measure by thermocouple to account_for heat receive by the coolant but not originate from the anode plug . 
the argon flow from commercial bottle was regulate by a pressure regulator and measure with a gas flow rator . 
the power source be a commercial direct_current rectifier . 
at 100 amp the 360 cycle ripple be less_than 0.5 v ( peak to peak ) with a resistive load . 
the current was regulate by_means_of a variable_resistor and measure with a 50 mv shunt and millivoltmeter . 
the arc voltage was measure with a voltmeter whose terminal were connect to the anode and cathode holder . 
because of the falling characteristic of the rectifier , no ballast_resistor was require for stability of operation . 
a high_frequency starter was use to start the arc . 
the anode holder show in figure 2 was design with two goal in mind . 
the heat loss of the holder were to be reduce as_far_as_possible and they should be such_that an accurate heat balance can be make . 
in_order to reduce the number of variable parameter , all experiment were make with a constant arc length of 0.5 '' and a current of 100 amp . 
the argon flow through the porous anode was vary systematically between **f . 
and **f . 
the lower_limit was determine by the fact that for smaller flow_rate the arc start to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug and that it become highly unstable . 
the upper_limit was determine by the difficulty of measure the characteristic anode surface temperature ( see below ) since only a small region of the anode was strike by the arc . 
this region which have a high temperature than the rest of the anode surface change size and location continuously . 
for each mass flow_rate the arc voltage was measure . 
to measure the surface temperature of the anode plug , the surface was scan with a pyrometer . 
as it turn_out , a very hot region occur on the plug . 
its temperature was denote by **f . 
the size of this hot region was estimate by eye . 
the rest of the surface have a temperature which decrease towards the outer diameter of the plug . 
the mean temperature of this region was approximate by the temperature measure halfway between the edge of the hot spot and the rim of the plug . 
it was denote by **f . 
the mean temperature of the surface was then compute according to the following relation : **f where x be the fraction of the plug area cover by the hot spot . 
assume thermal equilibrium between the anode surface and the transpiring argon , the gas enthalpy rise through the anode was calculate according_to the relation **f whereby the specific_heat of argon was take as **f . 
this calculation result in an enthalpy rise which be somewhat high because it assume a mass flow equally distribute over the plug cross_section whereas in_reality the mass velocity is expect to be smaller in the region of high temperature . 
the upstream gas temperature measure with the thermocouple show in figure 2 be **f . 
the **f value are list in table 1 together with the measured surface temperature and arc voltage . 
simultaneously with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurement pyrometer reading were take along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode holder as indicate on figure 2 . 
some of these temperature are plot in figure 4 . 
they show no marked dependence on the flow_rate within the accuracy of these measurement . 
thus , the dotted line show in figure 4 was take as typical for the temperature distribution for all blowing rate . 
the thermocouple in the aluminum disk show in figure 2 indicate an equilibrium temperature of the surface of **f . 
this temperature was take as environmental temperature to which the anode holder was expose as_far_as radiation is concern . 
it be sufficiently small compare with the surface temperature of the anode holder , to make the energy flux radiate from the environment toward the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurement . 
the reflection of radiation originate from the anode holder and reflect back to it by the surrounding metal surface should also be small because of the specular characteristic of the metal surface and of the specific geometry . 
the total heat loss through the anode holder include also the heat conduct through the base of the cylindrical piece into the adjacent metal part . 
it was calculate from the temperature_gradient **f at **f inch as **f . 
the total heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder be thereby **f the temperature distribution of figure 4 give **f for all blowing rate , assume **f . 
the temperature dependent value of |e was take from reference 7 . 
the radiation loss from the anode surface was compute according_to **f where **f be the mean of the fourth power of the temperature **f and **f calculate analogously to equation ( 1 ) . 
a band viscometer is show in figure 2 . 
it consist_of two block with flat surface hold apart by shim . 
there be a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be test is place . 
a tape of cellulose_acetate is pull between the block and the tape pull the fluid or paste with it between the parallel face of the block . 
in normal use weight are hang_on the end of the tape and allow to pull the tape and the material to be test between the block . 
after it has reach terminal_velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is record . 
by the use of various weight , data for a force rate of shear graph can be obtain . 
the instrument use for this work be a slight modification of that previously describe . 
in this test a * * f tape was pull between the block with a motor and pulley at a rate of * * f with a clearance of 0.002 '' on each side of the tape . 
this give a rate of shear of * * f . 
this , however , can only be consider approximate , as the diameter of the pulley was increase by the buildup of tape and the tape was occasionally remove from the pulley during the run . 
the face of one block contain a hole 1 16 '' in diameter which lead to a manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure . 
although there be only four fluid test , it be apparent that there be two distinct type . 
two of the fluid show a high positive normal pressure when undergo shear , and two show small negative pressure which be negligible in_comparison_with the amount of the positive pressure generate by the other two . 
figure 3 show the data on a silicone fluid , label 12500 cps which give a high positive normal pressure . 
although the tape was run for over 1 hr , a steady state was not reach , and it was conclude that the reason for this be that the back pressure of the manometer was build_up from the material feed from between the block and this be available at a very slow rate . 
a system had_to be use which did not depend_upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurement of the normal pressure were to be make in a reasonable time . 
a back pressure was then introduce , and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicate which be great , the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure . 
by this method it was determine that the normal pressure exert by a sample of polybutene ( molecular_weight report to be 770 ) be over half an atmosphere . 
the actual pressure was not determine because the pressure be beyond the upper_limit of the apparatus on_hand . 
the two fluid which give the small negative pressure be polybutene with molecular_weight which were state to be 520 and 300 . 
these be fluid which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more newtonian because of their lower molecular_weight . 
the maximum suction be 3.25 '' of test fluid measure from the top of the block , and steady state were apparently reach with these fluid . 
it is presume that this negative head be associated with some geometric factor of the assembly , since different reading were obtain with the same fluid and the only apparent difference be the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus . 
this negative pressure is not explain by the velocity head * * f since this be not sufficient to explain the reading by several magnitude . 
these experiment can be consider exploratory only . 
however , they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressure in the presence of flat shear field which were forecast by the theory in the first part of the paper . 
they also give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressure . 
such an instrument would be useful for the characterization of many commercial material as_well_as theoretical study . 
the elasticity as a parameter of fluid which be not subject_to simple measurement at_present , and it be a parameter which is probably vary in an unknown manner with many commercial material . 
such an instrument is expect to be especially useful if it could be use to measure the elasticity of heavy paste such_as printing_ink , paint , adhesive , molten plastic , and bread_dough , for the elasticity is related to those various property term `` length '' , `` shortness '' , `` spinnability '' , etc. , which are usually judge by subjective method at_present . 
the actual change * * f cause by a shear field is calculate by multiply the pressure differential times the volume , just_as_it_is for any gravitational or osmotic_pressure head . 
if the volume be the molal volume , then * * f is obtain on a molal basis which be the customary terminology of the chemist . 
although the * * f calculation be obvious by_analogy_with that for gravitational_field and osmotic_pressure , it be interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalize to include related effect . 
consider a shear field with a height of h and a cross-sectional area of a oppose by a manometer with a height of h ( refer to the same base as h ) and a cross-sectional area of a . 
if * * f be the change per unit volume in person function cause by the shear field at constant p and t , and |r be the density of the fluid , then the total potential_energy of the system above the reference height be * * f . 
* * f be the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to h . 
the total volume of the system above the reference height be * * f , and h can be eliminate to obtain an equation for the total potential_energy of the system in_terms_of h . 
the minimum total potential_energy is find by take the derivative with_respect_to h and equate to zero . 
this give * * f , which be the pressure . 
this be interesting for it combine both the thermodynamic concept of a minimum person function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential_energy for equilibrium . 
this method can be extend to include the concentration difference cause by shear field . 
the relation between osmotic_pressure and the person function may also be develop in an analogous way . 
in the above development we have apply the thermodynamics_of_equilibrium ( refer to by some as thermostatics ) to the steady state . 
this can be justify thermodynamically in this case , and this will be do in a separate paper which is being prepare . 
this have an interesting analogy with the assumption state by person that `` the deformational mechanics of elastic solid can be apply to flowing solution '' . 
there be one exception to the above statement as has been point_out , and that be that fluid can relax by flow into field of lower rate of shear , so the statement should be modify by state that the mechanics be similar . 
if the mechanics be similar , we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar . 
the concept of the strain energy as a person function difference * * f and exert a force normal to the shearing face be compatible with the information obtain from optical birefringence study of fluid undergo shear . 
essentially these birefringence study show that at low rate of shear a tension be present at 45 ` to the direction of shear , and as the rate of shear increase , the direction of the maximum tension move asymptotically toward the direction of shear . 
according_to person , the recoverable shear s is give by * * f where |c be the angle_of_extinction . 
from this and the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic energy of deformation which should be equal to the * * f calculate from the pressure normal to the shearing face . 
there be another means which should show the direction and relative value of the stress in viscoelastic fluid that is not mention as_such in the literature , and that be the shape of the suspended drop of low viscosity fluid in shear field . 
these droplet are distort by the normal force just as a balloon would be pull or press out of shape in one 's hand . 
these droplet appear to be ellipsoid , and it be mathematically convenient to assume that they be . 
if they be not ellipsoid , the conclusion will be a reasonable approximation . 
the direction of the tension of minimum pressure is , of_course , give by the direction of the major_axis of the ellipsoid . 
person and person both show that the major_axis of the ellipsoid be at 45 ` at low rate of shear and that it approach the direction of shear with increased rate of shear . 
( some suspension break_up before they be near to the direction of shear , and some become asymptotic to it without breakup . ) 
this be , of_course , a similar type of behavior to that indicate by birefringence study . 
the relative force can be calculate from the various radius_of_curvature if we assume : ( a ) the surface_tension be uniform on the surface of the drop . 
( b ) that because of the low viscosity of the fluid , the internal pressure be the same in all direction . 
( c ) the kinetic effect be negligible . 
( d ) since the shape of the drop conform_to the force field , it does not appreciably affect the distribution of force in the fluid . 
these be reasonable assumption with low viscosity fluid suspend in high viscosity fluid which are subject to low rate of shear . 
just as the pressure exert by surface_tension in a spherical drop be * * f and the pressure exert by surface_tension on a cylindrical shape be * * f , the pressure exert by any curved surface be * * f , where |g be the interfacial_tension and * * f and * * f be the two radius_of_curvature . 
this formula is give by person and person . 
if a be the major_axis of an ellipsoid and b and c be the other two axis , the radius_of_curvature in the ab plane at the end of the axis be * * f , and the difference in pressure along the a and b axis be * * f . 
there be no data publish in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drop to confirm the above formula . 
however , there be photograph of suspend drop of cyclohexanol_phthalate ( viscosity 155 poise ) suspend in corn_syrup of 71 poise in a paper by person and person . 
this viscosity of the material in the drop be , of_course , not negligible . 
measurement on the photograph in this paper give * * f at the maximum rate of shear of * * f . 
if it is assume that the formula give by person of * * f , cosecant 2lc apply , the pressure difference along the major_axis can be calculate from the angle of inclination of the major_axis , and from this the interfacial_tension can be calculate . 
its value be * * f from the above data . 
this appear to be high , as would be expect from the appreciable viscosity of the material in the drop . 
it be appropriate to call_attention_to certain thermodynamic property of an ideal_gas that be analogous to rubberlike deformation . 
the internal energy of an ideal_gas depend_on temperature only and be independent of pressure or volume . 
in_other_words , if an ideal_gas is compress and keep at constant temperature , the work do in compress it is completely convert into heat and transfer to the surrounding heat_sink . 
this mean that work equal q which in_turn equal * * f . 
there be a well-known relationship between probability and entropy which state that * * f , where \q be the probability that state ( i.e. , volume for an ideal_gas ) could be reach by chance alone . 
this is known as conformational_entropy . 
this conformational_entropy be , in this case , equal to the usual entropy , for there be no other change or other energy involve . 
note that though the ideal_gas itself contain no additional energy , the compressed gas does exert an increased pressure . 
the energy for any isothermal work do by the perfect_gas must come as thermal energy from its surroundings . 
a proton_magnetic_resonance study of polycrystalline **f as a function of magnetic_field and temperature is present . 
**f be paramagnetic , and electron paramagnetic dipole as_well_as nuclear dipole effect lead to line broadening . 
the line be asymmetric and over the range of field **f gauss and temperature **f the asymmetry increase with increasing **f and decreasing t . 
an isotropic resonance shift of **f to lower applied field indicate a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction . 
the general theory of resonance shift is use to derive a general expression for the second_moment **f of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialize to **f . 
the theory predict a linear dependence of **f on **f , where |j be the experimentally determine person constant . 
the experimental second_moment **f conform_to the relation **f in_agreement with theory . 
hence , the electron paramagnetic effect ( slope ) can be separate from the nuclear effect ( intercept ) . 
the paramagnetic dipole effect provide some information on the particle shape . 
the nuclear dipole effect provide some information on the motion of the hydrogen nucleus , but the symmetry of the **f bond in **f remain in doubt . 
the magnetic_moment of an unpaired electron associate nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic_resonance property of nucleus . 
it be important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since quantitative nuclear_resonance is become increasingly use in investigation of structure . 
**f appear to be well suited for the study of these matter , since it be a normal paramagnet , with three unpaired electron on the chromium , its crystal structure be very simple , and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong **f bond provide structural interest . 
we first discuss the **f bond in **f . 
we then outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipole with nucleus and show that the theory be in excellent agreement with experiment . 
indeed it be possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effect . 
the information provide by the electron paramagnetic effect is then discuss , and finally the nuclear effect are interpret in_terms_of various motional modified model of the **f bond in **f . 
theoretical study of the hydrogen_bond generally agree that the **f bond will be linear in the absence of peculiarity of packing in the solid . 
moreover , it will be asymmetric until a certain critical **f distance is reach , below which it will become symmetric . 
there be ample evidence from many source that the **f bond in **f be symmetric . 
the **f distance in **f be 2.26 a . 
there be evidence , though less convincing than for **f , that the **f bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime be symmetric . 
here the **f distance be 2.44 a . 
a number of semiempirical estimate by various worker lead to the conclusion that the **f bond become symmetric when the **f bond length be about 2.4 to 2.5 a , but aside from the possible example of nickel dimethylglyoxime there have be no convincing report of symmetric **f bond . 
person has study the crystal structure of **f by x-ray_diffraction . 
he find the structure contain an **f bond with the **f distance of **f . 
there be , then , the possibility that this **f bond be symmetric , although person be unable to determine its symmetry from his x_ray data . 
person find **f to be trigonal , person symmetry **f , with **f , **f . 
x_ray and experimental density show one formula unit in the unit_cell , correspond to a paramagnetic ion density of **f . 
the x_ray data did not permit person to determine uniquely the space group , but a negative test for piezoelectricity lead him to assume a center of symmetry . 
under this assumption the space group must be **f and the following be the position of the atom in the unit_cell . 
**f . 
this space group require the hydrogen_bond to be symmetric . 
person find powder intensity calculation and measurement to agree best for **f . 
these data lead to a structure in which sheet of cr atom lie between two sheet of o atom . 
the o atom in each sheet be close-packed and each cr atom is surround by a distorted octahedron of o atom . 
the **f layer are stack normal to the [ 111 ] axis with the lower oxygen of one layer directly above the upper oxygen of the neighboring lower layer , in such a manner that the repeat be every three layer . 
the separate layer are join together by hydrogen_bond . 
a drawing of the structure is to be_found in reference 6 . 
the gross detail of the structure appear reasonable . 
the structure appear to be unique among rooh compound , but be the same as that assume by **f . 
the bond angle and distance be all within the expected limit and the volume per oxygen be about normal . 
however , the possible absence of a center of symmetry not_only move the hydrogen_atom off **f , but also allow the oxygen atom to become nonequivalent , with **f at **f and **f at **f ( space group **f ) , where **f represent the oxygen on one side of the **f layer and **f those on the other side . 
however , any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely short **f interlayer distance of 2.55 a or the non hydrogen_bond **f interlayer interaction which be already quite short at 2.58 a . 
hence it be difficult to conceive_of a packing of the atom in this material in which the oxygen atom be far from geometrical equivalence . 
the only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen_atom to occupy general , rather_than special , position along the [ 111 ] axis . 
if the **f bond be linear then there be three reasonable position for the hydrogen_atom : ( 1 ) the hydrogen_atom be centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the oxygen sheet ; ( 2 ) all hydrogen_atom lie on a sheet , but the sheet be close to one oxygen sheet than to the other ; ( 3 ) hydrogen_atom be asymmetrically place , either randomly or in an ordered way , so that some hydrogen_atom be close to the upper oxygen atom while others be close to the lower oxygen atom . 
position ( 2 ) appear to us to be unlikely in_view_of the absence of a piezoelectric_effect and on general chemical structural grounds . 
a randomization of `` ups '' and `` downs '' be more likely than ordered `` ups '' and `` downs '' in position ( 3 ) since the hydrogen_atom are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another , and also since ordered `` up '' and `` down '' imply a larger unit_cell , for which no evidence exist . 
therefore , the only unknown structural feature would appear to be whether the hydrogen_atom be located symmetrically ( 1 ) or asymmetrically ( 3 ) . 
person prepare his sample of **f by thermal decomposition of aqueous chromic_acid at 300 - 325 ` c . 
person be kind enough to lend us about 5 gram of his material . 
this material prove to be unsatisfactory , since we could not obtain reproducible result on various portion of the sample . 
subsequently , we learn from person that his sample contain a_few percent **f impurity . 
since **f be ferromagnetic , we feel that any result obtain from the magnetically contaminate **f would be suspect . 
person suggest another preparation of **f which we use here . 
500 ml of 1 m aqueous **f with 1 g **f add are heat in a bomb at 170 ` c for 48 hour . 
a very fine , gray solid ( about 15 g ) is form , water-wash by centrifugation , and dry at 110 ` c . 
differential thermal analysis show a very small endothermic_reaction at 340 ` c and a large endothermic_reaction at 470 ` c . 
this latter reaction be in_accord with the reported decomposition of **f . 
thermogravimetric analysis show a weight loss of 1.8  centered at 337 ` c and another weight loss of 10.8  at 463 ` c . 
the expected weight loss for **f go_to **f and **f be 10.6  . 
mass-spectrometric analysis of gas evolve upon heat to 410 ` c indicate nitrogen_oxide and water_vapor . 
the small reaction occur at 337 ` c is probably cause by decomposition of occluded nitrate , and perhaps by a small amount of some hydrous material other_than **f . 
all subsequent measurement were make on material which had been heat to 375 ` c for one hour . 
emission_spectrum indicate **f calcium and all other impurity much lower . 
chromium analysis give 58.8  cr as compare with 61.2  theory . 
however , **f adsorb water from the atmosphere and this may account_for the low chromium analysis and high total weight loss . 
the x-ray_diffraction pattern of the material , take with cukla radiation , indicate the presence of no extra line and be in good agreement with the pattern of person . 
magnetic analysis by person of this laboratory indicate no ferromagnetic impurity . 
**f was find to be paramagnetic with three unpaired electron per chromium atom and a molecular susceptibility of **f , where **f . 
for exactly three unpaired electron the coefficient would be 3.10 . 
an infrared_spectrum , obtain by person and person of this laboratory , show band in the position find by person . 
electron_microscopic examination of the **f sample show it to be composed of nearly isotropic particle about 0.3 lm in diameter . 
the particle appear rough and undoubtedly the single crystal domain be smaller than this . 
the x_ray data be consistent with particle size of 1000 a or great . 
we find no obvious effect due_to preferred orientation of the crystallite in this sample nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape find from electron_microscopic examination . 
the magnetic_resonance absorption was detect by employ a varian model **f broad line spectrometer and the associated 12 - inch electromagnet system . 
one measurement at 40 mc / sec was obtain with the varian model **f unit . 
a bridged-t type of bridge was use in the 10 - 16 mc / sec range . 
the rf power level was maintain small enough at all time to prevent obvious line shape distortion by saturation effect . 
a modulation frequency of 40 cps with an amplitude as small as possible , commensurate with reasonably good signal-to-noise quality , was use . 
background spectrum were obtain in all case . 
the spectrometer was adjust to minimize the amount of dispersion mode mix_in with the absorption signal . 
a single value of the thermal relaxation_time **f at room_temperature was measure by the progressive saturation method . 
the value of **f estimate at 470 gauss be **f microsecond . 
a single measurement of the spin spin relaxation_time **f was obtain at 10 mc / sec by pulse method . 
this measurement was obtain by person of the group , by observe the breadth of the free induction decay signal . 
the value derive be 16 microsecond . 
field shift were derive from the mean value of the resonance line , define as the field about which the first_moment be zero . 
second_moment of the spectrum were compute by numerical integration . 
correction were apply for modulation broaden , apparatus background , and field shift . 
spectrum were obtain over the temperature range of 77 - 294 ` k . 
for the low_temperature measurement the sample was cool by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of person and person . 
the temperature was maintain to within about **f for the period_of_time require to make the measurement ( usually about one hour ) . 
one sample , which had been expose to the atmosphere after evacuation at 375 ` c , show the presence of adsorbed water ( about 0.3 wt  ) as evidence by a weak resonance line which be very narrow at room_temperature and which disappear , due_to broadening , at low_temperature . 
the data report here be either from spectrum from which the adsorbed water resonance could easily be eliminate or from spectrum of sample evacuate and sealed_off at 375 ` c which contain no adsorbed water . 
the measured powder density of the **f use here be about **f , approximately one-third that of the crystal density ( **f ) . 
such a density correspond to a paramagnetic ion density of about **f . 
spectrum were obtain from a powdered sample have the shape of a right circular cylinder with a height to diameter ratio of 4 : 1 . 
the top of the sample be nearly flat and the bottom hemispherical . 
spectrum were also obtain from a sample in a spherical container which was make by blow a bubble on the end of a capillary glass tube . 
the bubble was fill to the top and special precaution were taken to prevent any sample from remain in the capillary . 
spectrum were also obtain from a third sample of **f which had been dilute to three_times its original volume with powdered , anhydrous alundum ( **f ) . 
this sample was contain in a cylindrical container similar to that describe above . 
polyphosphate give renewed life to soap product at a time when surfactant be a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphate spell the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphate and synthetic detergent active was recognize and exploit . 
the market today for detergent_builder be quite diverse . 
the best-known field of application for builder be in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulation for household use . 
these widely advertised product , which are use primarily for wash clothes , be based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic active ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonate ) and contain up_to 50  by weight of sodium_tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium_tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium_pyrophosphate . 
in the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulation based on nonionic active with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; light-duty synthetic detergent with much less builder ; and the dwindling built soap_powder as_well_as soap_flakes and granule , none of which are now nationally advertise . 
a well publicized entrant which has achieve success only recently be the built liquid_detergent , with which the major problem today be incorporation of builder and active into a small volume use a sufficiently high builder / active ratio . 
hard surface cleaning in household application is represent by two class of alkaline product : ( 1 ) the formulation make expressly for machine dishwasher , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaner use for wall and woodwork . 
the better quality product in both of these line contain phosphate builder . 
in_addition , many of the hard surface cleaner use for wall and woodwork have their genesis in trisodium_orthophosphate , which be still the major ingredient of a number of such product . 
many scouring powder now also contain phosphate . 
these hard surface cleaner are discuss in chapter twenty-eighth . 
cleaning or detergent action be entirely a matter of surface . 
wet cleaning involve an aqueous medium , a solid substrate , soil to be remove , and the detergent or surface-active material . 
an oversimplified differentiation between soft - and hard surface cleaning lie_in the magnitude and kind of surface involve . 
one gram of cotton has been find to have a specific surface_area of * * f . 
in contrast , a metal coupon * * f in size would have a magnitude from 100000 to a_million less . 
even here there is room for some variation , for metal surface vary in smoothness , absorptive capacity , and chemical reactivity . 
person use a person surface analyzer in a metal cleaning study and show considerable difference in soil removal , depend_upon surface roughness . 
there are considerable difference between the requirement for textile and hard surface cleaning . 
exclusive of esthetic value , such_as high - or low foam level , perfume content , etc. , the requirement for the organic active use in washing textile be high . 
no matter how they are formulate , a large_number of organic active be simply not suitable for this application , since they do not give adequate soil removal . 
this is best demonstrate by practical washing test in which cloth article are repeatedly wash with the same detergent formulation . 
a good formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many washing ; whereas , with a poor formulation , the clothes exhibit a buildup of `` tattletale_grey '' and dirty spot - sometimes with bad result even after the first wash . 
since practical washing procedure be both lengthy and expensive , a number of laboratory test have been develop for the numerical evaluation of detergent . 
person has indicate that two device , the launder-ometer and terg-o-tometer are most widely use for rapid detergent testing , and he has list the commercially available standard soiled fabric . 
also give are several laboratory wash procedure in general use . 
the soiled fabric use for rapid testing of detergent formulation are make in such a way that only part of the soil is remove by even the best detergent formulation in a single wash . 
in this way , numerical value for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulation can be obtain by measure the reflectance ( whiteness ) of the cloth swatch before and after washing . 
soil redeposition is evaluate by wash clean swatch with the dirty ones . 
as_is the case with the surface-active_agent , the requirement for builder to be use in detergent composition for washing textile be also high . 
large_number of potential builder have been investigate , but none have been find to be as effective as the polyphosphate over the relatively wide range of condition meet in_practice . 
the problem of hard surface cleaning be not nearly as complex . 
in hard surface cleaning , the inorganic salt be more important than the organic active . 
indeed , when the proper inorganic constituent are employ , practically any wetting or surface-active_agent will do a reasonably good job when present in sufficient amount in a hard surface cleaning formulation . 
hydroxide , orthophosphate , borate , carbonate , and silicate be important inorganic ingredient of hard surface cleaner . 
in_addition , the polyphosphate are also use , probably act_as more as peptizing agent than anything else . 
the importance of the inorganic constituent in hard surface cleaning has been emphasize in a number of papers . 
although there is no question but that the process of washing fabric involve a number of phenomenon which are relate together in an extremely complicated way and that these phenomenon and their interrelation are not well understand at the present , this section attempt to present briefly an up-to-date picture of the physical_chemistry of washing either fabric or hard surface . 
the purpose of washing be , obviously , to remove soil which are arbitrarily class in the four major category give below : 
dirt , which is here define as particulate material which be usually inorganic and be very often extremely finely divide so as to exhibit colloidal property . 
greasy soil , which are typify by hydrocarbon and fat ( ester of glycerol with long chain organic acid ) . 
stain , which include the wide variety of nonparticulate material which give color even when present in very low concentration on the soiled object . 
miscellaneous soil , which primarily include sticky substance and colorless liquid which evaporate to leave a residue . 
the dirt on the soiled object is mechanically hold by surface irregularity to some extent . 
however , a major factor in bind dirt be the attraction between surface that goes_under_the_name_of van_der_waal's_forces . 
this be a theoretically complicated dipole interaction which cause any extremely small uncharged particle to agglomerate with other small uncharged particle , or to stick_to an uncharged surface . 
obviously , if colloidal particle bear charge of opposite sign or , if one kind be charged and the other kind be not , the attraction will be intensify and the tendency to agglomerate will be greatly reinforce . 
likewise , a charged particle will tend to stick_to an uncharged surface and vice_versa , and a charged particle will be very strongly attract to a surface exhibit an opposite charge . 
in_addition , dirt particle can be hold onto a soiled surface by sticky substance or by the surface_tension of liquid , include liquid grease . 
grease , stain , and miscellaneous soil are usually sorb onto the soiled surface . 
in most case , these soil are take_up as liquid through capillary_action . 
in an essentially static system , an oil cannot be replace by water on a surface unless the interfacial_tension of the water phase are reduce by a surface-active_agent . 
the washing process whereby soil are remove consist basically of apply mechanical action to loosen the dirt particle and dried matter in the presence of water which help to float off the debris and act_as , to some extent , as a dissolving_agent and solvating_agent agent . 
greasy soil are hardly remove by washing in plain water ; and natural water , in_addition , often contain impurity such_as calcium salt which can react with soil to make them more difficult to remove . 
therefore , detergent are use . 
the detergent active be that substance which primarily act to remove greasy soil . 
the other constituent in a built detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty stain and the hydrophilic sticky or dried soil . 
as_is well_known , detergent active belong_to the chemical class consist_of moderately high molecular_weight and highly polar molecule which exhibit the property of form micelle in solution . 
physicochemical investigation of anionic surfactant , include the soap , have show that there be little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anion below a certain region of concentration called the critical micelle concentration . 
( 1 ) below the critical micelle concentration , monomer and some dimer be present . 
( 2 ) in the critical micelle region , there be a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelle , which have a degree of polymerization average around 60 - 80 . 
( 3 ) for anionic , these micelle appear to be roughly spherical assemblage in which the hydrocarbon tail come together so that the polar group ( the ionized end ) face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase . 
obviously hydrophobic ( oleophilic ) substance such_as grease , oil , or particle have a greasy or oily surface be more at_home in the center of a micelle than in the aqueous phase . 
micelle can imbibe and hold a considerable amount of oleophilic substance so that the micelle volume may be increase as_much_as approximately twofold . 
although the matter has not been unequivocally demonstrate , the available data show that micelle in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process . 
related_to micelle formation be the technologically important ability of detergent active to congregate at oil-water_interface in such a manner that the polar ( or ionized ) end of the molecule is direct towards the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards the oily phase . 
in the cleaning process , sorbed greasy soil become coated in this manner with an oriented film of surfactant . 
then during washing , the greasy soil roll back at the edge so that emulsified droplet can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass , with the aid of mechanical action , and enter the aqueous phase . 
obviously , a substance which is permanently or temporarily sorb on the surface in_place_of the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off the greasy soil . 
substance other_than detergent active also tend to be strongly sorb from aqueous medium onto surface of other contiguous condensed phase . 
this be particularly true of highly charged ion , especially those ion which fall_into the class of polyelectrolyte . 
whereas the usual organic surface-active_agent is strongly sorb at oil-water_interface , the highly charged ion are most strongly sorb at interface between water and insoluble material exhibit an ionic structure ( see table 26 - 2 on page 1678 ) . 
thus , for aqueous medium , we can think_of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic or hydrophobic surface-active_agent , and of an idealized builder as a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active_agent . 
from the equilibrium sorption data which be available , it seem logical to expect that polyphosphate ion would be strongly sorb on the surface of the dirt ( especially clay soil ) so as to give it a greatly increased negative_charge . 
the charged particle then repel each other and are also repel from the charged surface , which almost invariably bear a negative_charge under washing condition . 
the negatively_charged dirt particle then leave the surface and go_into the aqueous phase . 
this hypothesis is evolve in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic active in detergency . 
it does not consider the kinetic effect of the phosphate builder on sorption desorption phenomenon which will be discuss later ( see page 1746 - 1748 ) . 
the crude picture of the detergency process thus_far develop can be represent as : * * f the influence of mechanical action on the particle of free soil may be compare to that of kinetic_energy on a molecular scale . 
freed soil must be disperse and protect against flocculation . 
cleaned cloth must be protect against the redeposition of dispersed soil . 
it be evident that the requirement impose by these effect upon any one detergent constituent act alone be severe . 
upon consideration of the variety of soil and fabric normally encounter in the washing process , it be little wonder that the use of a number of detergent constituent have `` synergistic '' property has gain widespread acceptance . 
in the overall process , it be difficult to assign a `` pure '' role to each constituent of a built detergent formulation ; and , indeed , there is no_more reason to separate the interrelated role of the active , builder , antiredeposition agent , etc. than there is to assign individual action to each of the numerous isomer make_up a given commercial organic active . 
the thermal exchange of chlorine between * * f and liquid * * f be readily measurable at temperature in the range of 180 ` and above . 
the photochemical_exchange occur with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at 65 ` use light absorb only by the * * f . 
in the gas phase , with * * f of * * f and * * f of * * f , quantum yield of the order of * * f have been observe at 85 ` . 
despite extensive attempt to obtain highly pure reagent , serious difficulty was experience in obtain reproducible rate of reaction . 
it appear possible to set a lower_limit of about * * f for the activation_energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon_tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form * * f radical . 
the rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appear to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicate that the radical intermediate are remove at the wall or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reaction . 
because of the simplicity of the molecule , isotopic exchange reaction between elemental halogen and the corresponding carbon_tetrahalide would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibility for obtain unambiguous basic kinetic data . 
it would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanism for the thermal and photochemical_reaction in both the liquid and gas phase and to determine value for activation_energy of some of the intermediate reaction of atom and free_radical , as_well_as information on the heat_of_dissociation of the carbon halogen bond . 
the reaction of chlorine with carbon_tetrachloride seem particularly suited for such study . 
it should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chloride on a vacuum system follow by multiple distillation of the liquid . 
it should be possible to free carbon_tetrachloride of any interfering substance by the usual purification method follow by prechlorination prior to addition of radioactive chlorine . 
furthermore , the exchange would not be expect to be sensitive to trace amount of impurity because it would not be apt to be a chain_reaction since the activation_energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expect to be too high ; also it would be expect that * * f would compete very effectively with any impurity as a scavenger for * * f radical . 
contrary to these expectation we have find it impossible to obtain the degree of reproducibility one would wish , even with extensive effort to prepare especially pure reagent . 
we are report these investigation here briefly because of their relevancy to problem of the study of apparently simple exchange reaction of chlorine and because the result furnish some information on the activation_energy for abstraction of chlorine atom from carbon_tetrachloride . 
person highest purity tank chlorine was pass through a tube of resublimed * * f into an evacuated pyrex system where it was condense with liquid_air . 
it was then distill at_least three time from a trap at_- 78 ` to a liquid_air trap with only a small middle fraction being retain in each distillation . 
the purified product was store at_- 78 ` in a tube equip with a break_seal . 
of several method employ for tag chlorine with radiochlorine , the exchange of inactive chlorine with tagged aluminum_chloride at room_temperature was find to be the most satisfactory . 
to prepare the latter , silver_chloride was precipitate from a solution contain * * f obtain from the group . 
the silver_chloride was fuse under vacuum in the presence of aluminum chip with the resultant product of * * f which was sublime into a flask on the vacuum line . 
previously purified chlorine was subsequently admit and the exchange was allow to take_place . 
the radiochlorine was store at_- 78 ` in a tube equip with a break_seal . 
liter quantity of mallinckrodt , low sulfur , reagent grade carbon_tetrachloride were saturate with * * f and * * f and illuminate for about 50 hour with a 1000 watt tungsten lamp at a distance of a_few inch . 
the mixture was then extract with alkali and with water following which the carbon_tetrachloride was distill on a person column , a 25  center cut being retain which was then degas under vacuum in the presence of * * f . 
purified inactive chlorine was then add from one of the tube describe above and the mixture freeze_out and seal_off in a flask equip with a break_seal . 
this chlorine carbon_tetrachloride solution was illuminate for a day following which the flask was reseal onto a vacuum system and the excess chlorine distill off . 
the required amount of carbon_tetrachloride was distill into a series of reaction cell on a manifold on a vacuum line . 
the desired amount of inactive chlorine and radioactive chlorine were likewise condense in these cell on the vacuum line following which they were freeze_down and the manifold as_a_whole was seal_off . 
the content of the manifold for liquid phase experiment were then mix by shaking , redistribute to the reaction tube , freeze_down , and each tube was then sealed_off . 
the reactant for the gas phase experiment were first freeze_out in a side arm attach to the manifold and then allow to distill slowly into the manifold of precooled reaction cell before seal_off . 
this method in_general solve the problem of obtain fairly equal concentration of reactant in each of the six cell from a set . 
the sample for liquid phase thermal reaction study were prepare in pyrex capillary_tubing 2.5 mm i.d. and about 15 cm long . 
in a_few experiment the tube were make from standard 6 mm i.d. pyrex tubing of 1 mm wall thickness . 
both type of tube withstand the pressure of approximately 20 atmosphere exert by the carbon_tetrachloride at 220 ` . 
the photochemical_reaction cell consist_of 10 mm i.d. pyrex tubing , 5.5 cm long , diffraction effect being minimize by the fact that the light pass_through only liquid glass interface and not gas glass interface . 
these cell were use rather than square pyrex tubing because of the tendency of the latter to shatter when thaw frozen carbon_tetrachloride . 
the round cell were reproducibly position in the light_beam which enter the thermostated mineral_oil bath through a window . 
two type of light source were use , a thousand watt projection lamp and an ah6 high pressure mercury arc . 
the light was filter by the soft_glass window of the thermostat thus ensure that only light absorb by the chlorine and not by the carbon_tetrachloride could enter the reaction cell . 
relative incident light intensity were measure with a thermopile potentiometer system . 
change of intensity on the cell were achieve by use of a wire screen and by vary the distance of the light source from the cell . 
follow reaction the cell were scratch with a file and open under a 20  aqueous sodium_iodide solution . 
carrier * * f was add and the aqueous and organic phase were separate ( cell contain gaseous reactant were immerse in liquid_air before open under sodium_iodide ) . 
after titration of the liberated * * f with * * f , aliquot of the aqueous and of the organic phase were count in a solution type geiger_tube . 
in the liquid phase run the amount of carbon_tetrachloride in each reaction tube was determine by weigh the tube before open and weigh the fragment after empty . 
the fraction of exchange was determine as the ratio of the count / minute observe in the carbon_tetrachloride to the count / minute calculate for the carbon_tetrachloride fraction for equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon_tetrachloride , empirically determine correction being make for the difference in counting efficiency of * * f in * * f and * * f . 
in study the liquid phase thermal reaction , some 70 tube from 12 different manifold filling were prepare and analyze . 
experiment were do at 180 , 200 , 210 , 220 ` . 
follow observation of the fact that the reaction rate of supposedly identical reaction mixture prepare on the same filling manifold and expose under identical condition often differ by several hundred percent , a systematic series of experiment was undertake to see whether the difficulty could be ascribe to the method of prepare the chlorine , to the effect of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tube . 
in_addition to the method describe in the section above , chlorine and radiochlorine were prepare by the electrolysis of a * * f eutectic on the vacuum line , and by exchange of * * f with molten * * f . 
calcium_hydride was substitute for * * f as a drying_agent for carbon_tetrachloride . 
no correlation between these variable and the irreproducibility of the result was find . 
the reaction rate observe at 200 ` range from * * f of the chlorine exchange per hour to 0.7 exchange per hour . 
in most case the chlorine concentration be about * * f . 
set of reaction tube contain 0.2 of an atmosphere of added oxygen in one case and added moisture in another , both give reaction rate in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 of the chlorine exchange per hour . 
no detectable reaction was find at room_temperature for reaction mixture allow to stand up_to 5 hour . 
the liquid phase photochemical_exchange between chlorine and carbon_tetrachloride be more reproducible than the thermal exchange , although still erratic . 
the improvement be most noticeable in the great consistency among reaction cell prepare as_a_group on the same manifold . 
rather large difference were still find between reaction cell from different manifold filling . 
some 80 reaction tube from 13 manifold filling were illuminate in the temperature range from 40 to 85 ` in a further endeavor to determine the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on the activation_energy and the effect of light intensity . 
in all case there be readily measurable exchange after as little as one hour of illumination . 
by compare reaction cell seal from the same manifold temperature dependency corresponding to activation_energy range from 11 to 18 * * f was observe while dependence on the first power of the light intensity seem to be indicate in most case . 
it be possible to make estimate of the quantum yield by observe the extent of reduction of a uranyl_oxalate actinometer solution illuminate for a known time in a typical reaction cell and make appropriate conversion base on the difference in the absorption_spectrum of uranyl_oxalate and of chlorine , and consider the spectral distribution of the light source . 
these estimate indicate that the quantum yield for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon_tetrachloride at 65 ` be of the order_of_magnitude of unity . 
when typical reaction cell to which 0.3 of an atmosphere of oxygen had been add were illuminate , chlorine and phosgene were produce . 
exchange was also observe in these cell , which have chlorine present at * * f . 
although there be some variation in result which must be attribute either to trace impurity or to variation in wall effect , the photochemical_exchange in the gas phase be sufficiently reproducible so that it seem meaningful to compare the reaction rate in different series of reaction tube for the purpose of obtain information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon_tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate . 
data on such comparison together with data on the effect of light intensity are give in table /1 . 
. 
in series /1 , the relative light intensity was vary by vary the distance of the lamp from the reaction cell over the range from 14.7 to 29.2 cm . 
the last column show the rate of exchange that would have been observe at a relative intensity of 4 ( 14.7 cm distance ) calculate on the assumption that the incident light intensity be inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate be directly proportional to the incident light intensity . 
direct proportionality of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assume in obtain the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series /2 , where the light intensity was reduce by use of a screen . 
the person effect ( person , 1937 ; person and person , 1950 ) , which be a retardation of the orbital motion of particle by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive_force of the impinging solar_radiation , cause the dust to spiral into the sun in time much short than the age of the earth . 
the radial velocity vary inversely as the particle size - a 1000 - | m diameter particle near the orbit of mars would reach the sun in about 60 million year . 
person ( 1955 ) extend the effect to include the solar_radiation corpuscular_radiation pressure , which increase both the minimum particle size and the drag . 
further , the corpuscular_radiation , i.e. , the solar_wind proton , must sputter away the surface atom of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the person effect and the ratio of the repulsive_force to the gravitational_force . 
the person effect cause the semi major_axis of orbit to diminish more rapidly than the semiminor_axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbit as the particle move toward the sun . 
also , planetary gravitational_attraction increase the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approach . 
at one astronomical_unit from the sun ( the earth 's distance ) the dust orbit be probably nearly circular . 
if such be the case , the particle within a distance of about * * f km of the earth will have , relative to the earth , a kinetic_energy less than their potential_energy and they will be capture into orbit about the earth . 
person ( 1955 ) has calculate the time require for these particle to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the person effect , which in this case cause the orbit to become more_and_more eccentric without change the semi major_axis . 
this effect can give_rise to a blanket of micrometeorite around the earth . 
since there be a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in space because of the radiation effect , there must be a continual replenishment : otherwise , micrometeorite would have disappear from interplanetary_space . 
there are several possible source . 
according_to person ( 1955 ) , cometary debris be sufficient to replenish the material spiral into the sun , maintain a fairly steady state . 
asteroidal collision are also think to contribute material . 
it be also possible that some of the dust in the vicinity of the earth originate from meteoritic impact upon the moon . 
one cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite flux in space . 
even in the neighborhood of the earth , where information has been obtain both directly and indirectly , the derived flux value vary by at_least four order_of_magnitude . 
this large discrepancy demonstrate the inadequacy of the experimental method and the lack of understanding of the various phenomenon involved . 
beyond a_few million kilometer from the earth , but still in the region of the earth 's orbit , a prediction of the flux of dust be even more unreliable . 
at great distance from the sun , the situation be still less certain . 
there are several source of evidence on the micrometeorite environment . 
direct information has been obtain from rocket and satellite equip with impact sensor . 
in_addition , the size distribution obtain from visual and radar observation of meteor may be extrapolate to the micrometeorite domain . 
from the brightness of the f component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal_light , an estimate of the particle size , concentration , and spatial distribution can be derive for region of space near the ecliptic plane . 
another important source of evidence only recently receive much attention be the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic component . 
the core of deep sea sediment and content of collector in remote region be valuable in this category . 
the data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the earth . 
the direct_evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the earth is obtain from piezoelectric sensor ( essentially microphone ) and from wire gage ; these instrument are install on rocket , satellite , and space_probe . 
statistically , the most significant data have been collect from the sensor on 1958 alpha ( explorer_1 , ) , 1958 delta_2 ( sputnik 3 , ) , and 1959 eta ( vanguard 3 , ) . 
these vehicle , with large sensitive area , have collect data for long enough time to give reliable impact rate for the period of exposure . 
many other vehicle with smaller sensitive area exposure time product contribute some information . 
the impact rate on 1958 alpha for 153 event be * * f for particle of mass great than * * f ( person , 1960 ) ; this mass threshold was derive from the detector calibration and an assumed impact velocity of * * f . 
the data show daily_variation and diurnal_variation . 
ninety percent of the 153 record impact occur between midnight and noon , and from day to day the variation of the rate be as much as an order_of_magnitude . 
one may conclude that most_of the detected micrometeoritic material be concentrated in orbital stream which intersect the earth 's orbit . 
there have been contradictory report from 1958 delta_2 , and the data quote here are believe to be the more reliable . 
on may 15 , a very large increase occur with * * f of mass between * * f and * * f ; for the next two day , the impact rate be * * f ; and for the next nine day , the impact rate be less_than * * f ( person , 1960 ) . 
the data for the first day indicate a meteor_stream with a very high concentration of particle and may have lead to the high estimate of micrometeorite flux . 
preliminary data from 1959_eta give an average impact rate of * * f for mass larger than * * f for about 1000 event in a 22 - day period ( person and person , 1960 ) . 
the day-to-day rate vary by less_than a factor of 4.5 . 
the data have not_yet been analyze for diurnal_variation . 
note that the mass threshold be four_times that of 1958_alpha and that the flux be one-fifth as large . 
if one assume that the average flux did not change between measurement , a mass distribution curve is obtain which relate the flux of particle larger than a given radius to the inverse 7 2 power of the radius . 
space_probe have yield little information . 
pioneer_1 , record a decrease in flux with distance from the earth on the basis of 11 count in 9 hour . 
with detector sensitive to three mass interval and base on a_few count , the second and third russian space_probe indicate that the flux of the smallest particle detect be less_than that of larger ones . 
be based on so few event , these result be of dubious validity . 
the calibration of piezoelectric sensor in_terms_of the particle parameter be very uncertain . 
many worker believe that the response be proportional to the incident momentum of the particle , a relation deduce from laboratory result linearly extrapolate to meteoritic velocity . 
however , one must expect that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity impact would cause a deviation from a linear relationship . 
in the united_states , most_of the sensor are calibrate by drop small sphere on their sensitive surface . 
the russian experimenter claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensor is cause by the incident momentum with the remainder be momentum of eject material from the sensor . 
this `` ejection '' momentum be linearly related to the particle energy . 
they quote about the same mass threshold as that of the u.s. apparatus , but a momentum threshold about 40 times great . 
there is a difference in the experimental arrangement , in_that the u.s. microphone are attach directly to the vehicle skin while the russian instrument are isolate from the skin . 
the threshold mass is derive from the momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of * * f in the u.s. work and * * f in the ussr work . 
the threshold mass of about * * f correspond to a 10 - | m diameter sphere of density * * f . 
however , the conversion from mass to size be unreliable , since many photographic meteor give evidence of a fluffy , loosely bound meteorite structure with density as low as * * f . 
to_what_extent such low_density apply to micrometeorite be unknown . 
the velocity value use be also open_to some question ; if a substantial fraction of the dust is orbit about the earth , only about one-third the above-mentioned average velocity should be use in derive the mass . 
zodiacal_light and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust blanket , a phenomenon also to be expect if the dust before capture be in circular orbit about the sun , as indicate by the trend of the smaller visible meteor . 
the diurnal_variation in the observed flux may be partly due_to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident velocity . 
the flux of micrometeorite in the neighborhood of the earth can be estimate by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data . 
a summary of meteorite data , prepare by person ( 1958 ) on the basis of photographic , visual , and radar evidence , is give in table 5 - 1 . 
from an estimated mass of 25 g for a zero magnitude meteorite , the other mass are derive with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each unit increase in magnitude . 
the radius is calculate from the mass by assume sphere of density * * f except for the smallest particle , which must have a high mass density to remain in the solar_system in the presence of solar_radiation pressure . 
the flux value be for all particle with mass great than the given mass and be based on an estimate of the number of visual meteor . 
it is assume that the flux value increase by a factor of 2.512 per magnitude , in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude be constant . 
the value agree with the data from 1958_alpha and 1959_eta . 
the figure in the next-to-last column are derive with the assumption of 50 percent shielding by the earth ; hence , these figure apply immediately above the earth 's atmosphere . 
the unshielded flux is give in the last column ; these figure constitute the best estimate for the flux in interplanetary_space near the earth . 
of_course , if there be a dust blanket around the earth , the flux in interplanetary_space should be less_than the figure give here . 
note that the mass scale be one to two order_of_magnitude great than some previously use ; for_example , person ( 1948 ) derive a scale of 0.15 g for a * * f , zero magnitude meteorite . 
the old scale be based on theoretical estimate of the conversion efficiency of kinetic_energy into light . 
the mass scale use in table 5 - 1 was derive on the assumption that the motion of the glowing trail is related_to the momentum transfer to the trail by the meteorite , permit the calculation of the mass if the velocity is know ( person and person , 1958 ) . 
a concentration distribution has been derive from radar observation sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude ( person and person , 1959 ) . 
extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude cover the range of micrometeorite . 
the approximate equation be * * f , where n be the number of * * f with electron line density great than or equal to * * f , and q be proportional to the mass of the meteorite . 
therefore , n be inversely proportional to the radius cube and in fair agreement with the inverse 7 2 power derive from 1958_alpha and 1959_eta data . 
at the fifteenth magnitude , * * f , and at the twenty-fifth magnitude , * * f . 
these extrapolated flux be about an order_of_magnitude less_than the value from the satellite data and the figure in person 's table . 
the extrapolation may be in error for several reason . 
the observational data determine the concentration distribution have a range of error which is magnify in the extension into the micrometeorite region . 
the solar electromagnetic - and corpuscular-radiation_pressure and the associated person effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size decrease and modify the distribution and limit size to larger than a_few micron . 
also , it has been suggest that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorite ( person , 1960 ) , and the same distribution would not be expect . 
a measure of the total mass accretion of meteoritic material by the earth is obtain from analysis of deep sea sediment and dust collect in remote region ( person , 1960 ) . 
most meteoritic material , by the time it reach the earth's_surface , has been reduce to dust or to spherule of ablated material in its passage through the atmosphere . 
for all meteorite , the average nickel content be about 2.5 percent . 
this be much high than the nickel content of terrestrial dust and sediment and provide a basis for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx . 
present data indicate an accretion of about * * f ton per_year over the entire globe , or about * * f . 
biological_warfare be the intentional use of living microorganism or their toxic product for the purpose of destroy or reduce the military effectiveness of man . 
it be the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious_disease agent by scientific research and development , result in the production of bw weapons_system . 
man may also be injure secondarily by damage to his food crop or domestic_animal . 
biological_warfare is consider to be primarily a strategic weapon . 
the major reason for this be that it have no quick kill effect . 
the incubation_period of infectious_disease , plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect , render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter . 
a man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation_period of most infectious_disease . 
thus , an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population center such_as large city . 
an important operational procedure in bw for an enemy would be to create an aerosol or cloud of agent over the target_area . 
this concept has stimulate much basic research concern the behavior of particulate biological material , the pathogenesis of respiratory infection , the medical management of such disease and defense against their occurrence . 
the biological and physical_property of infectious particle have been study intensively during the past fifteen year . 
much new equipment and many unique technique have been develop for the quantitative exposure of experimental animal to aerosol of infectious agent contain in particle of specified dimensional characteristic . 
much information has been gather relative to quantitative sampling and assessment technique . 
much of the old experimental work on respiratory infection was accomplish by very artificial procedure . 
the intra nasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an anesthetized animal be far different from exposure , through natural respiration , to aerosolized organism . 
the importance of particle size in such aerosol has be thoroughly demonstrate . 
the natural anatomical and physiological defensive feature of the upper respiratory_tract , such_as the turbinate of the nose and the cilium of the trachea and larger bronchus , be capable of impinging out the larger particle to which we be ordinarily exposed in our daily existence . 
very small particle , however , in a size range of 1 to 4 micron in diameter be capable of pass these impinging barrier and enter the alveolar_bed of the lung . 
this area be highly susceptible to infection . 
the entrance and retention of infectious particle in the alveolus amount almost to an intra tissue inoculation . 
the relationship between particle size and infectious dose is illustrate in table 1 . 
in consider bw defense , it must be recognize that a number of critical meteorological parameter must be meet for an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect . 
for_example , bright sunlight be rapidly destructive for living microorganism suspend in air . 
there be optimal humidity requirement for various agent when airborne . 
neutral or inversion meteorological_conditions be necessary for a cloud to travel_along the surface . 
it will rise during lapse condition . 
there be , of_course , certain time during the 24 - hour daily cycle when most_of these condition will be meet . 
certain other property of small particle , in_addition_to those already mention in_connection_with penetration of the respiratory_tract , be noteworthy in defense consideration . 
the smaller the particle the further it will travel downwind before settle out . 
an aerosol of such small particle . 
moreover , diffuse through structure in much the same manner as a gas . 
there may be a number of secondary effect result from diffusion through building such_as widespread contamination of kitchen , restaurant , food store , hospital , etc. . 
depending_on the organism , there may be multiplication in some food or beverage product , i.e. , in milk for_example . 
the secondary consequence from this could be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for defense . 
something of the behavior of cloud of small particle can be illustrate by the following field_trial : 
in the first trial an inert substance was disseminate from a boat travel some ten mile off shore under appropriately select meteorological_conditions . 
zinc_cadmium_sulfide in particle of 2 micron in size were disseminate . 
this material fluoresce under ultraviolet_light which facilitate its sampling and assessment . 
four_hundred and fifty pound was disseminate while the ship was travel a distance of 156 mile . 
figure 1 describe the result obtain in this trial . 
the particle travel a maximum detected distance of some 450 mile . 
from these dosage isopleth it can be see that an area of over 34000 square_mile was cover . 
these dosage could have been increase by increase the source strength which be small in this case . 
the behavior of a biological aerosol , on a much smaller scale , is illustrate by a specific field_trial conduct with a non pathogenic organism . 
an aqueous suspension of the spore of b subtilis , var. niger , generally known as bacillus_globigii , was aerosolize use commercially available nozzle . 
a satisfactory cloud was produce even_though these nozzle be only about 5 percent efficient in produce an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 micron . 
in this test , 130 gallon of a suspension , have a count of * * f organism per ml , or a total of approximately * * f spore , was aerosolize . 
the spraying operation was conduct from the rear deck of a small naval vessel , cruise two mile offshore and vertical to an onshore breeze . 
spraying continue along a two mile course . 
this operation was start at 5 : 00 pm and last for 29 minute . 
there be a slight lapse condition , a moderate fog , and 100 percent relative_humidity . 
a network of sampling_station had been set_up on shore . 
these be located at the home of government employee , in government_office , building and reservation within the trial area . 
a rough attempt was make to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by take sample from outside the window on the first , ninth , and fifteenth floor of a government_office building . 
all sampler were operate for a period of two hour except one , which was operate for four hour . 
in this instance , there be a dosage of 562 during the first two hour and a total dosage of 1980 for the four hour period , a fourfold increase . 
this suggest that the sampling period , particularly at the more distant location , should have been increase . 
as can be see from figure 2 , an extensive area was cover by this aerosol . 
the maximum distance sample be 23 mile from the source . 
as can be see from these dosage isopleth , approximately 100 square_mile was cover within the area sample . 
it be quite likely that an even greater area was cover , particularly downwind . 
the dosage in the three level of the vertical profile be : * * f this be not , of_course , enough sample to give a satisfactory description of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol . 
a number of unique medical problem might be create when man is expose to an infectious agent through the respiratory route rather_than by the natural portal of entry . 
some agent have been show to be much more toxic or infectious to experimental animal when exposed to aerosol of optimum particle size than by the natural portal . 
botulinal toxin , for_example , be several thousand-fold more toxic by this route than when give per os . 
in some instance a different clinical disease picture may result from this route of exposure , make diagnosis difficult . 
in tularemia produce by aerosol exposure , one would not expect to find the classical ulcer of `` rabbit_fever '' on a finger . 
an enemy would obviously choose an agent that is believe to be highly infectious . 
agent that are know to cause frequent infection among laboratory worker such_as those cause q_fever , tularemia , brucellosis , glanders , coccidioidomycosis , etc. , belong in this category . 
an agent would likely be select which would possess sufficient viability and virulence stability to meet realistic minimal logistic requirement . 
it be , obviously , a proper goal of research to improve on this property . 
in this connection it should be capable of being disseminate without excessive destruction . 
moreover , it should not be so fastidious in its growth requirement as to make production on a militarily significant scale improbable . 
an aggressor would use an agent against which there be a minimal naturally acquire or artificially induce immunity in a target population . 
a solid immunity be the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralize . 
it must be remember , however , that there be many agent for which there be no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be break by an appropriate dose of agent . 
there be a broad spectrum of organism from which selection for a specified military purpose might be make . 
an enemy might choose an acutely debilitating microorganism , a chronic disease producer or one cause a high rate of lethality . 
it be possible that certain mutational form may be produce such_as antibiotic resistant strain . 
mutant may also be develop with change in biochemical property that be of importance in identification . 
all_of these consideration be of critical importance in consider defense and medical management . 
biological agent be , of_course , highly host specific . 
they do not destroy physical_structure as be true of high_explosive . 
this may be of overriding importance in consider military objective . 
the question of epidemic disease merit some discussion . 
only a limited effort has been devote to this problem . 
some of those who question the value of bw have assume that the only potential would be in the establishment of epidemic . 
they then point_out that with our present lack of knowledge of all the factor concerned in the rise and fall of epidemic , it be unlikely that a planned episode could be initiate . 
they argue further ( and somewhat contradictorily ) that our knowledge and resource in preventive_medicine would make it possible to control such an outbreak of disease . 
this be why this approach to bw defense has not been give major attention . 
our major problem be what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target . 
this , of_course , does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose agent that are associate naturally with epidemic disease . 
a hypothetical example will illustrate this point . 
let us assume that it would be possible for an enemy to create an aerosol of the causative agent of epidemic typhus ( rickettsia_prowazwki ) over city a and that a large_number of case of typhus_fever result therefrom . 
no epidemic was initiate nor was one expect because the population in city a be not lousy . 
lousiness be a prerequisite for epidemic typhus . 
in this case , then , the military objective was accomplish with an epidemic agent solely through the result secure in the initial attack . 
this was done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic . 
on_the_other_hand , a similar attack might have been make on location whose population was know to be lousy . 
one might expect some spread of the disease in this case result in increased effectiveness of the attack . 
the major defensive problem are concerned with the possibility of overt military delivery of biological agent from appropriate disseminating device . 
it should be no_more difficult to deliver such device than other weapon . 
the same delivery vehicle - whether they be airplane , submarine or guided_missile - should be usable . 
if it be possible for an enemy to put an atomic_bomb on a city , it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent over that city . 
biological agent be , moreover , suitable for delivery through enemy sabotage which impose many problem in defense . 
a_few obvious target_area of great importance might be mention . 
the air-conditioning and ventilating_system of large building be subject_to attack . 
america is rapidly become a nation that use processed , precooked and even predigested food . 
this be an enormous industry that is subject_to sabotage . 
one must include the preparation of soft_drink and the processing of milk and milk product . 
huge industry be involved also in the production of biological product , drug and cosmetics which be liable to this type of attack . 
a variety of technique have been direct toward the isolation and study of blood_group antibody . 
these include low_temperature ethanol ( person ) fractionation , electrophoresis , ultracentrifugation and column_chromatography on ion_exchange cellulose . 
modification of the last technique have been apply by several group of investigator . 
person and person , use a stepwise elution scheme , fractionate whole serum contain abo_antibodies and rh_antibody on diethylaminoethyl_cellulose deae_cellulose and carboxymethyl_cellulose . 
person and co-worker , in a similar study of blood_group antibody of whole serum , use a series of gradient for elution from deae_cellulose . 
person and person use a single , continuous gradient at constant ph for the fractionation of anti - a and anti - b agglutinin from preisolate | gamma_globulin sample . 
in the present work whole serum have been fractionate by chromatography on deae_cellulose use single gradient similar to those describe by person and person , and certain chemical and serological property of the fraction contain antibody of the abo and rh system have been describe . 
serum sample were obtain from normal group a , group b and group o donor . 
three of the anti - rh serum use were take from recently sensitize individual . 
one contain complete antibody and have a titer of 1 : 512 in saline . 
the second contain incomplete antibody and show titer of 1 : 256 in albumin and 1 : 2048 by the indirect_coombs_test . 
the third , contain the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibody , have titer of 1 : 256 in saline , 1 : 512 in albumin and 1 : 1024 by the indirect_coombs_test . 
in_addition one serum was obtain from a donor ( person . ) who had been sensitize 6 year previously . 
this serum exhibit titer of 1 : 16 in albumin and 1 : 256 by the indirect_coombs_test . 
these antibody titer were determine by reaction with homozygous * * f red_blood_cell . 
anti - a and anti - b activity were determine in fraction from the serum of group a , group b or group o donor by the following tube agglutination method . 
one drop of each sample was add to one drop of a 2  suspension of group * * f or group b red_blood_cell in a small * * f test_tube . 
in several instance group o cell were also use as control . 
the red_blood_cell be use within 2 day after donation and were wash with large amount of saline before use . 
the mixture of sample plus cell suspension were allow to stand at room_temperature for 1 hr . 
the tube were then centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examine macroscopically for agglutination . 
for the albumin method , equal volume of 30  bovine albumin , sample and 2  cell suspend in saline were allow to stand at room_temperature for 1 hr and then were centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 1 min . 
all sample were test by both the saline and albumin method . 
the activity of fraction of serum contain rh_antibody were test by the saline , albumin and indirect_coombs technique . 
homozygous and heterozygous * * f cell , * * f and homozygous and heterozygous * * f cell were use to test each sample ; however , in the interest of clarity and conciseness only the result obtain with homozygous * * f and homozygous * * f cell will be present here . 
the saline and albumin test were perform as describe for the abo sample except that the mixture was incubate for 1 hr at 37 ` c before centrifugation . 
the saline tube were save and use for the indirect_coombs_test in the following manner . 
the cell were wash three time with saline , anti human serum was add , the cell were resuspend , and the mixture was centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examine for agglutination . 
the anti human serum use were prepare by inject whole human serum into rabbit . 
those antiserum show by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the `` broad spectrum '' type were select for use in the present study . 
the red_blood_cell for the rh_antibody test were use within 3 day after draw except for the * * f cell , which had been glycerolize and store at - 20 ` c for approximately 1 year . 
these cell were thaw at 37 ` c for 30 min and were deglycerolize by alternately centrifuge and mix with descend concentration of glycerol solution ( 20 , 18 , 10 , 8 , 4 and 2  ) . 
the cell were then wash three time with saline and resuspend to 2  in saline . 
blood sample were allow to clot at room_temperature for 3 hr , centrifuge and the serum was remove . 
the serum was measure volumetrically and subsequently dialyze in the cold for at_least 24 hr against three to four change , approximately 750 ml each , of `` starting_buffer '' . 
this buffer , ph 8.6 , be 0.005 m in * * f and 0.039 m in tris ( hydroxymethyl ) - aminomethane ( tris ) . 
after dialysis the sample was centrifuge and the supernatant place on a * * f cm column of deae_cellulose equilibrate with starting_buffer . 
the deae_cellulose , contain 0.78 meq of n / g , was prepare in our laboratory by the method of person and person ( 7 ) from powdered cellulose , 100 - 230 mesh . 
the small amount of insoluble material which precipitate during dialysis was suspend in approximately 5 ml of starting_buffer , centrifuge , resuspend in 25 ml of isotonic saline and test for antibody activity . 
the chromatography was do at 6 ` c use gradient elution , essentially according_to person and person . 
the deep concave gradient employ ( fig 2 ) was obtain with a nine chambered gradient elution device ( `` varigrad '' , reference ( 8 ) ) and has been describe elsewhere . 
the other , a shallow concave gradient ( fig 1 ) , was produce with a so-called `` cone sphere '' apparatus , the `` cone '' be a 2 - liter erlenmeyer_flask and the `` sphere , '' a 2 - liter round-bottom flask . 
each initially contain 1700 ml of buffer ; in the sphere be start buffer and in the cone be final buffer , 0.50 m in both * * f and tris , ph 4.1 . 
a flow_rate of 72 * * f was use and 12 ml fraction were collect . 
approximately 165 fraction were obtain from each column . 
these were read at 280 m | m in a beckman model du spectrophotometer and test for antibody activity as describe above . 
for protein identification , fraction from the column were concentrate by pervaporation against a stream of air at 5 ` c or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permit simultaneous concentration of the protein and dialysis against isotonic saline . 
during the latter procedure the temperature was maintain at 2 ` c by surround the apparatus with ice . 
because negative pressure dialysis give better recovery of protein , permit detection of protein concentrated from very dilute solution and be a gentle procedure , it be use in all but the early experiment . 
paper_electrophoresis was carry_out on the concentrated sample in a spinco model r cell use barbital buffer , ph 8.6 , ionic strength 0.075 , at room_temperature on whatman 3 mm filter_paper . 
five milliampere / cell were apply for 18 hr , after which the strip were stain with bromophenol_blue and densitometry was carry_out use a spinco_analytrol . 
when paper_electrophoresis was to be use for preparation , eight strip of a whole serum sample or a chromatographic fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were run / chamber under the condition describe above . 
at the end of the run , the strip in the third and sixth position in each chamber were dry , stain for 1 hr , wash and dry , while the other strip were maintain in a horizontal position at 1 ` c . 
the unstained strip were then mark , use the stained ones as a guide , and cut transversely so as to separate the various protein band . 
the strip section contain a given protein were pool , elute with 0.5 ml of isotonic saline , and the eluate were test for antibody activity . 
fraction from the column which were to be subject to analytical ultracentrifugation were concentrate by negative pressure dialysis and dialyze for 16 hr in the cold against at_least 500 volume of phosphate buffer saline , ph 7.2 , ionic strength 0.154 . 
they were then centrifuge at 59780 rpm for 35 to 80 min at 20 ` c in a spinco model e ultracentrifuge at a protein concentration of 1.00 to 1.25  . 
sedimentation coefficient were compute as * * f value and relative amount of the various component were calculate from the schlieren pattern . 
for preparative ultracentrifugation , fraction from the column were concentrate by negative pressure dialysis to volume of 1 ml or less , transfer to cellulose tube and dilute to 12 ml with isotonic saline . 
ultracentrifugation was then carry_out in a spinco model l ultracentrifuge at 40000 rpm for 125 to 150 min , refrigeration being use throughout the run . 
successive 1 - ml fraction were then draw off with a hypodermic_syringe , start at the top of the tube , and test for agglutinin activity . 
other method will be describe below . 
the insoluble material which precipitate during dialysis against starting_buffer always show intense agglutinin activity , regardless of the blood_group of the donor . 
with either of the gradient describe , chromatography on deae_cellulose separate agglutinin of the abo series into at_least three region ( fig 1 and 2 ) : 
one of extremely low anionic binding capacity , one of low anionic bind capacity and one of high anionic bind capacity . 
these have been label region 1 , 2 , and 4 , respectively , in fig 1 . 
when the early part of the gradient was flatten , either by use the gradient show in fig 2 or by allow the `` cone sphere '' gradient to become established more slowly , region 2 activity could sometimes be separate into two area ( donor person and person , fig 1 and person , fig 2 ) . 
the latter procedure give_rise to a small active protein peak ( region 1a ) between region 1 and 2 . 
in 2 of 15 experiment on whole serum a region of agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic bind capacity was detect ( region 3 , fig 1 ) . 
moreover , after concentration use negative pressure dialysis , agglutinin activity could sometimes be detect in the region designate 2a ( donor person , person , and person , fig 1 ) . 
not all these region exhibit equal agglutinating_activity , as evidence by titer and the extent of the active area . 
in all case , most of the activity lie_in the region of high anionic bind capacity . 
this be particularly noticeable in group a and group b serum , in which case activity in region 1 and 2 be usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally could not be detect at_all . 
there appear to be no difference in the distribution of anti - a and anti - b activity in group o serum , though in two group o donor ( person and e._m. ) only one type of agglutinin was find in the region of low anionic bind capacity ( fig 1 and 2 ) . 
several sample of citrate plasma were fractionate in our laboratory by method 6 of person et_al. . 
these fraction were test for abo agglutinin activity , use fraction from group ab plasma as a control . 
as_expected , most of the activity was find in fraction * * f , with slight activity see in fraction 4 , - 1 . 
a sample of fraction * * f from group o plasma was dissolve in starting_buffer , dialyze against this buffer and subject to chromatography use the gradient show in fig 2 . 
once_again , both anti - a and anti - b activity were find in the insoluble material precipitate during dialysis . 
similarly , both type of antibody were find in three region of the chromatographic eluate , have extremely low , low , and high anionic bind capacity , respectively ( fig 3 ) . 
chromatography of whole serum reveal that the area of rh_antibody activity be generally continuous and wide . 
the incomplete antibody activity appear in the early part of the chromatogram ; the complete , in the latter part . 
the serum contain the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibody show activity in both region ( fig 1 ) . 
in all case the activity against * * f cell was spread over a wide area than that with * * f cell , regardless of the type of test ( saline , albumin , indirect_coombs ) use for comparison . 
the insoluble material result from dialysis against starting_buffer always show strong activity . 
in_fact agglutination of * * f cell in saline could be produce by the insoluble material from serum contain `` only '' incomplete antibody activity . 
this was later know to be the result of concentrate the minute amount of complete antibody find in these serum ; when the insoluble fraction was suspend in a volume of saline equal_to that of the original serum sample , no complete antibody activity could be detect . 
apart from the honeybee , practically all bee and bumblebee hibernate in a state of torpor . 
occasionally , you may come_across one or two bumblebee in the cold season , when you are turn_over sod in your garden , but you have_to be a really keen observer to see them at_all . 
they keep their wing and foot press tightly against their body , and in_spite_of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lump of dirt . 
i must add at_once that these animal be what we call `` queen '' , young female that have mate in the previous summer or autumn . 
it be on them alone that the future of their race depend_on , for all their relative ( mother , husband , brother , and unmated sister ) have perish with the arrival of the cold_weather . 
even some of the queen will die before the winter be over , fall prey to enemy or disease . 
the survivor emerge on some nice , sunny day in march or april , when the temperature be close to 50 ` f and there be not too_much wind . 
now the thing for us to do be to find ourselves a_couple_of those wonderful flowering currant such_as the red ribes_sanguineum of our location , or otherwise a good sloe tree , or perhaps some nice pussy_willow in bloom , preferably one with male or staminate catkin . 
the bloom of ribes and of the willow and sloe be the place where large_number of our early insect will assemble : honeybee , bumblebee , and other wild bee , and also various kind of fly . 
it be a happy , buzzing crowd . 
each male willow catkin be composed of a large_number of small flower . 
it be not difficult to see that the stamen of the catkin are always arrange in pair , and that each individual flower be nothing but one such pair stand on a green , black tip little scale . 
by scrutinize the flower , one can also notice that the scale bear one or two tiny wart . 
those be the nectary or honey gland ( fig 26 , page 74 ) . 
the staminate willow catkin , then , provide their visitor with both nectar and pollen ; a marvelous arrangement , for it provide exactly what the bee queen need to make their beebread , a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are feed . 
the only exception to this be certain bee that have become parasite . 
i will deal with these later_on . 
quite often , honeybee form a majority on the willow catkin . 
as we have already see in the first chapter , bumblebee be big , hairy , and much more colorful than honeybee , exhibit various combination of black , yellow , white and orange . 
let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game , and let us just call them bombus ; there must be several dozen species in the united_states alone . 
if you really insist on know their name , an excellent book on the north-american species be bumblebee and their way by person . 
if we manage to keep track of a bombus queen after she has leave her feeding place , we may discover the snug little hideout which she has fix_up for herself when she wake_up from her winter sleep . 
as befit a queen , a bumblebee female be rather choosy and may spend considerable time search for a suitable nesting_place . 
most species seem to prefer a ready-made hollow such_as a deserted mouse_nest , a birdhouse , or the hole make by a woodpecker ; some show a definite liking for make their nest in moss . 
once she has make_up_one's_mind , the queen start_out by construct , in her chosen abode , a small `` floor '' of dried grass or some woolly material . 
on this , she build an `` egg compartment '' or `` egg cell '' which is filled with that famous pollen and nectar mixture called beebread . 
she also build one or two waxen cup which she fill with honey . 
then , a group of egg is deposit in a cavity in the beebread loaf and the egg compartment is close . 
the queen afterward keep incubate and guard her egg like a mother hen , take a sip from_time_to_time from the rather liquid honey in her honey pot . 
when the larva hatch , they feed_on the beebread , although they also receive extra honey meal from their mother . 
she continue to add to the pollen supply as_needed . 
the larva , keep warm by the queen , be full-grown in about ten day . 
each now make a tough , papery cocoon and pupate . 
after another two_weeks , the first young emerge , four to eight small daughter that begin to play the role of worker_bee , collect pollen and nectar in the field and care for the new young generation while the queen retire to a life of egg_laying . 
the first worker_bee do not mate or lay egg ; male and mating female do not emerge until later in the season . 
the brood of worker that appear later tend to be bigger than the first ones , probably because they are better feed . 
by the middle of the summer , many_of the larva apparently receive such a good diet that it be `` optimal '' , and it is then that young queen begin to appear . 
simultaneously , male or drone are produce , mostly from the unfertilized egg of worker , although a few may be produce by the queen . 
the young queen and drone leave the nest and mate , and after a short period of freedom , the fertilized young queen will begin to dig in for the winter . 
it be an amazing fact that in some species this will happen while the summer be still in_full_swing , for_instance , in august . 
the temperature then be still very high . 
at the old nest , the queen will in the early fall cease to lay the fertilized egg that will produce female . 
as a result , the proportion of male ( which leave the nest ) increase , and eventually the old colony will die_out completely . 
the nest itself , the structure that in some case house about 2000 individual when the season be at its peak , is now rapidly destroy by the scavenging larva of certain beetle and moth . 
not always , though , does the development of a bumblebee colony take_place in the smooth fashion we have just describe . 
some member of the bee family have become idler , social parasite that live at the expense of their hardworking relative . 
bumblebee can thus suffer severely from the onslaught of psithyrus , the `` cuckoo-bumblebee '' as it is called in some european_country . 
female individual of psithyrus look deceptively like the worker and queen of the bumblebee they victimize . 
the one sure way to tell_apart victim and villain apart be to examine the hind_leg which in the case of the idler , psithyrus , lack the pollen basket - naturally ! 
the female parasite spend much time in her effort to find a nest of her host . 
when she succeed , she usually manage to slip_in unobtrusively , to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the bumblebee seal the egg compartment . 
the host never seem to recognize that something be amiss , so that the compartment afterward is seal normally . 
thus , the larva of the intruder can develop at the expense of the rightful inhabitant and the store of beebread . 
later_on , they and the mother psithyrus are feed by the bombus worker . 
worse still , in a number of case it has be claim that the psithyrus female kill_off the bombus queen . 
but let us return , after this gruesome interlude , to our willow catkin in the spring ; there be other wild bee that command our attention . 
it be almost certain that some of these , usually a_trifle smaller than the honeybee , be andrenas or mining_bee . 
there be about 200 different kind of andrena in europe alone . 
one of my favorite be a._armata , a species very common in england , where it is sometimes refer to as the lawn bee . 
the female like to burrow in the short turf of well-kept lawn , where their little mound of earth often appear by the hundred . 
almost equal in size to a honeybee . 
a._armata be much more beautiful in color , at_least in the female of the species : a rich , velvety , rusty red . 
the male be much dull . 
after having mate , an andrena female dig a hole straight down into the ground , form a burrow about the size of a lead_pencil . 
the bottom part of a burrow have a number of side tunnel or `` cell '' , each of which is provide with an egg plus a store of beebread . 
the development of the andrena larva be very rapid , so that by the end of spring they have already pupate and become adult . 
but they are still enclose in their larval cell and remain there throughout the summer , fall , and winter . 
their appearance , next spring , coincide in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plant . 
in the sacramento valley in california , for_instance , it has be observe that there be not one day 's difference between the emergence of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkin . 
this must be_due to a completely identical response to the weather , in the plant and the animal . 
after the male and female andrenas have mate , the cycle is repeat . 
although andrena be gregarious , so that we may find hundred and hundred of burrow together , we must still call it a solitary bee . 
its life_history be much simple than that of the truly colonial bumblebee and can serve as an example of the life_cycle of many other species . 
after_all , social life in the group of the bee be by_no_means general , although it certainly be a striking feature . 
on the basis of its life_history , we like to think that andrena be more primitive than the bumblebee . 
the way in which it transport its pollen be not so perfect , either . 
it lack pollen basket and possess only a large_number of long , branched hair on its leg , on which the pollen grain will collect . 
still andrena will do a reasonably good job , so that an animal with a full pollen load look_like a gay little piece of yellow down float in the wind . 
closely related to the andrena be the nomia or alkali_bee . 
nomia_melanderi can be find in tremendous number in certain part of the united_states west of the location , for_example , in utah and central washington . 
in the united_states department_of_agriculture 's yearbook_of_agriculture , 1952 , which is devote entirely to insect , person mention a site in utah which was estimate to contain 200000 nest female . 
often the burrow be only an inch or two apart , and the bee city cover several acres . 
the life_history of the alkali_bee be similar to that of andrena , but the first activity of the adult does not take_place until summer , and the individual hibernate in the prepupal stage . 
in most place , there be two generation a year , a second brood of adult appear late in the summer . 
i must plead guilty to a special sympathy for nomia . 
this may just be pride in my adopted location , but certainly i love to visit their mound city near location and location in july or august , when the bee be in their most active period . 
the name `` alkali_bee '' indicate that one has_to look_for them in rather inhospitable place . 
sometimes , although by_no_means always , these be indeed alkaline . 
the thing be that these bee love a fine-grained soil that be moist ; yet the water in the ground should not be stagnant either . 
they dislike dense vegetation . 
where does one find such condition ? 
the best chance , of_course , is offer by gently sloping terrain where the water remain close to the surface and where the air be dry , so that a high evaporation leave salty deposit which permit only sparse plant growth . 
many other ( probably nearly all ) snake at maturity be already more_than half their final length . 
person put length at maturity at two third the ultimate length for some rattlesnake , and person 's data on location garter_snake and ribbon_snake ( thamnophis ) show that the smallest gravid female be more_than half as long as the biggest adult . 
person state that `` when the snake reach its maturity it has already reach about its maximal length '' , but go_on to cite the reticulate python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three_times that at maturity . 
it be hard to understand how he conclude that most snake do not grow appreciably after attain maturity ; he was work with species of location , so perhaps some tropical snake be unusual in this respect . 
certain individual giant record later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it be impossible to know whether this be_due to captive condition . 
additional record of slow growth have been omit . 
it be possible to make a_few generalization about the six giant themselves . 
there seem to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate length , start with the smallest ( boa_constrictor ) and end with the largest ( anaconda ) . 
data on the former be scanty , but there can be little doubt that the latter be_born sometimes be_born at a length greater than that of any of the others , thereby lend support to the belief that the anaconda does , indeed , attain the greatest length . 
for four of the six ( the anaconda and the amethystine_python cannot be include for lack of data ) there be also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length , the boa_constrictor be the smallest and the indian_python the next in size at the former stage . 
let us speculate a_little on the maximum size of the anaconda . 
if , in a certain part of the range , it start life 1 foot long than do any of the other ( relatively large ) giant , and reach maturity at , let us guess , 18 inch long than the others , a quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of ( nearly ) 40 foot . 
when it come_to rate of early growth , the indian_python lead with a figure of about 3 foot 6 inch per_year for the first two year , more_or_less . 
the african rock_python , a close second , is follow in_turn by the reticulate python . 
there be few data on the boa_constrictor , those for the anaconda be unconvincing , and there be nothing at_all on the amethystine_python . 
it seem likely that the indian_python come_out ahead because record of its growth have been make more carefully and frequently ; it respond exceptionally well to captivity and does not reach proportion that make it hard to keep . 
i cannot make sense out of the figure for post maturity growth ; at_best the annual increase appear to be a matter of inch rather_than foot . 
until better record have been keep over long period_of_time and much more is know about the maximum dimension , it will be wise to refrain_from draw conclusion . 
it is often state that the largest snake require five year to attain maturity , but this apparently be an overestimation . 
the best way to determine the correct figure ( in captive ) be by direct observation of pair isolate from birth , a method that produce surprising result : maturing of a male indian_python in less_than two year , his mate in less_than three ; data on the boa_constrictor about match this . 
another approach be to estimate from the rate_of_growth and the smallest size at maturity . 
result from this approach amply confirm the direct observation : 
about three year be required , there be a possible slight difference between male and female in the time require . 
only the amethystine_python and the anaconda must be exclude for lack or paucity of data . 
the following information on snake vary greatly in size ( but all with less_than a 10 - foot maximum ) show , when consider with the foregoing , that there be probably no correlation between the length of a snake and the time require for it to mature . 
person , in his summary of the habit of the snake of the united_states , could supply data on the maturing period for only three species in_addition_to the rattler , which i shall consider separately . 
these three be much alike : lined_snake ( tropidoclonion ) , one year and nine month ; red-bellied_snake ( storeria ) , two year ; cottonmouth ( ancistrodon ) , two year . 
person investigate the rattlesnake carefully himself and also summarize what others have find . 
he conclude that in the southern species , which be rapidly growing type , female mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young when they be three . 
other herpetologist have ascertain that in the northern united_states the prairie_rattlesnake may_not give_birth first birth until it be four or even five year old , and that the young may be_born every_other year , rather_than annually . 
person 's study show that female common garter_snake and ribbon_snake of location mature at about the age of two . 
oversized monster are never bring home either alive or preserved , and field measurement be obviously open_to doubt because of the universal tendency to exaggerate dimension . 
measurement of skin be of little value ; every snake hide be noticeably long than its carcass and intentional stretching present no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer . 
in_spite of all the pitfall , there be a certain amount of agreement on some of the giant . 
the anaconda prove to be the fly_in_the_ointment , but the reason for this be not clear ; the relatively wild condition still find in tropical location might be responsible . 
there be three level on which to treat the subject . 
the first be the strictly scientific , which demand concrete proof and therefore may err on the conservative side by wait for evidence in_the_flesh . 
this approach reject virtually all field measurement . 
the next level attempt to weigh varied evidence and come to a balanced , sensible conclusion ; field measurement by experienced explorer are not reject , and even report of a less scientific nature are duly evaluate . 
the third level lean_on a belief that a_lot of smoke mean some fire . 
the argument against this last approach be comparable_to that which reject story about hoop_snake , about snake that break themselves into many piece and join up again , or even of ghost that chase people out of graveyard ; the mere pile_up of testimony does not prove , to the scientific mind , the existence of hoop_snake , joint_snake , or ghost . 
person has recently use the second level approach with the largest snake , and has come to these conclusion : 
the anaconda reach a length of at_least 37 foot , the reticulate python 33 , the african rock_python 25 , the amethystine_python at_least 22 , the indian_python 20 , and the boa_constrictor 18 - 12 . 
person also treat of the largest snake , but on the third level , and is chiefly concern with the anaconda . 
he reason that as anaconda 30 foot long are often find , some might be 38 , and occasional `` monstrous freak '' over 50 . 
he reject dimension of 70 foot and more . 
his thirteenth chapter include many exciting account of huge serpent with prodigious strength , but these seem to be give to complete his picture , not to be believe . 
detailed information on record length of the giant is give in the section that follow . 
discussion of the giant one_by_one will include , as_far_as_possible , data on these aspect of growth : 
size at which life is start and at which sexual maturity is reach ; time require to reach maturity ; rate_of_growth both before and after this crucial stage ; and maximum length , with confirmation or amplification of person 's figure . 
definite information on the growth of senile individual be lack . 
at_birth , this species vary considerably in size . 
a brood of twenty-eight bear at group , near location , range in_length from 22 to 33 - 1 2 inch and average 29 inch . 
person give measurement of nineteen young anaconda , presumably member of a brood , from `` location '' ; the extreme measurement of these fall between the lower_limit of the group brood and its average . 
person have two brood that average 27 inch . 
person and person give approximately 20 inch as the average length of a brood of thirty from the region of the orinoco estuary . 
person report 26 inch and 2.4 ounce ( this snake must have be emaciated ) for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from location . 
in contrast , person record the average length of seventy-two young of a 19 - foot female as 38 inch , and four young be_born in location at a length of 35 or 36 inch and a weight of from 14 to 16 ounce . 
person have a 3 - foot anaconda that weigh only 9.8 ounce . 
a difference between subspecies might explain the great range in size . 
i have little information on the anaconda 's rate_of_growth . 
person have one that increase from 19 - 1 2 inch to 5 foot 3 inch in five year , and person record a growth of from less_than 4 foot to nearly 10 in about six year . 
it be very unlikely that either of these anaconda was grow at a normal rate . 
in 1948 , person , the noted brazilian herpetologist , write a technical paper on the giant snake . 
he conclude that the anaconda 's maximum length be 12 or 13 ( perhaps 14 ) meter , which would approximate from 39 to 42 foot ( 14 meter be slightly less that 46 foot ) . 
thus , his estimate lie between person 's suggestion of at_least 37 foot and the 50 - foot `` monstrous freak '' intimate by person . 
the most convincing recent measurement of an anaconda was make in eastern location by person , a petroleum_geologist of the group , and report in 1944 by person . 
however , as a field measurement , it be open_to question . 
person 's 37 - 1 2 foot be partly based on this report and can be accept as probable . 
however , many herpetologist remain skeptical and would prefer a tentative maximum of about 30 foot . 
it be possible that especially large anaconda will prove to belong_to subspecies limit to a small area . 
in snake difference in size be a common characteristic of subspecies . 
a colombian female 's brood of sixteen boa_constrictor bear in the group average 20 inch . 
this birth length seem to be typical . 
when some thirteen record of newly and recently bear individual are collate , little or no correlation between length and distribution can be detect . 
the range be from 14 to 25 inch ; the former figure be based on a somewhat unusual birth of four by a central_american female ( see chapter on laying , brooding , hatching , and birth ) , the latter on a `` normal '' newly bear individual . 
however , as so many of the record be not certainly based on newborn snake , these data must be take tentatively ; final conclusion will have_to await the measurement of brood from definite locality . 
person 's measurement of several very young specimen from location suggest that at_birth the female be slightly larger than the male . 
i have surprisingly little information on the size and age at maturity . 
person has write to me of sexual_activity in february 1943 of young bear in march 1940 . 
one female , collect on an island off the coast of location , be gravid and measure 4 foot 8 inch from snout to vent ( her tail should be between 6 and 7 inch long ) . 
the female from location which give_birth to four be only 3 foot 11 inch long . 
what data there be on growth indicate considerable variation in rate ; unfortunately , no_one has keep complete record of one individual , whereas many have been make for a very short period_of_time . 
the result be too varied to allow generalization . 
the bronchus and pulmonary_artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout . 
the pulmonary_vein , however , without the limiting supportive tissue septum as in type 1 , , follow a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship ( fig 8 , 22 ) . 
another marked difference is note here . 
the pulmonary_artery , in_addition to supply the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole , the alveolar duct , and the alveolus , continue on and directly supply the thin pleura ( fig 8 ) . 
the bronchial_artery , except for a small number of short branch in the hilum , contribute none of the pleural blood supply . 
it does , as in type 1 , , supply the hilar lymph_node , the pulmonary_artery , the pulmonary_vein , the bronchus , and the bronchiole - terminate in a common capillary_bed with the pulmonary_artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole . 
no bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomosis were note in this group . 
lung type 3 , ( fig 3 ) be to some degree a composite of type 1 , and 2 , . 
it is characterize by the presence of incompletely developed secondary lobule ; well defined , but haphazardly arranged , interlobular septum and a thick , remarkably vascular pleura ( fig 9 ) . 
the most distal airway be similar to those find in type 1 , , be composed of numerous , apparently true terminal bronchiole and occasional , poorly developed respiratory bronchiole ( fig 14 , 15 ) . 
in this instance , because of incomplete septation , the secondary lobule does not constitute in itself what appear to be a small individual lung as in type 1 , . 
air drift from one area to another be , therefore , conceivable . 
distally the bronchus be situated between a pulmonary_artery on one side and a pulmonary_vein on the other , as in type 1 , ( fig 24 ) . 
this relationship , however , is not maintain centrally . 
here the pulmonary_vein , as in type 2 , , is note to draw away from the bronchus , and to follow a more direct , independent course to the hilum ( fig 23 , 24 ) . 
the bronchial_artery in its course and distribution differ somewhat from that find in other mammal . 
as see in type 1 , and 2 , , it supply the hilar lymph_node , vasa_vasorum to the pulmonary_artery and pulmonary_vein , the bronchus and the terminal bronchiole . 
as in type 1 , , it provide arterial blood to the interlobular septum , and an extremely rich anastomotic pleural supply is see ( fig 9 , 10 ) . 
this pleural supply is derive both from hilar and interlobular bronchial_artery branch . 
such a dual derivation was strikingly demonstrate during the injection process where initial filling would be note to occur in several isolated pleural vessel at_once . 
some of these were obviously fill from interlobular branch of the bronchial_artery while others were fill from direct hilar branch follow along the pleural surface . 
with completion of filling , netlike anastomosis were note to be present between these separately derived branch . 
an unusual increase in the number of bronchial_artery present within the substance of the lung was note . 
this was account_for primarily by the presence of a bronchial_artery closely follow the pulmonary_artery . 
the diameter of this bronchial_artery be much too large for it to be a mere vasa_vasorum ( fig 16 , 23 , 24 ) . 
in distal region its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that of the pulmonary_artery . 
this vessel could be follow to the parenchyma where it directly provide bronchial arterial blood to the alveolar capillary_bed ( fig 17 , 18 ) . 
also three other direct pathway of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were note : via the pleura ; through the interlobular septum ; and along the terminal bronchiole ( fig 14 , 17 , 18 , 19 ) . 
one bronchial arteriolar pulmonary arteriolar anastomosis was note at the terminal bronchiolar level ( fig 26 ) . 
it be evident that many marked and striking difference exist between lung when an interspecies comparison is make . 
the significance of these difference has not be study nor has the existence of corresponding physiologic difference been determine . 
however , the dynamics of airflow , from morphologic consideration alone , may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse . 
the volume and , perhaps , even the characteristic of bronchial arterial blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse . 
also , interlobular air drift may be all_but nonexistent in the cow ; probably occur in the horse much_as in the human_being ; and , in contrast be present to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where lobule be absent ( person and person , ' 31 ) . 
a reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology be entirely lacking at_present . 
within certain wide limit anatomy dictate function and , if one is permit to speculate , potential pathology should be include in this statement as_well . 
for_example , the marked susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related_to its delicate , long alveolar duct and short , large bronchiole situate within a parenchyma entirely lack in protective supportive tissue barrier such_as those find in type 1 , and 3 , . 
one might also wonder if monkey be capable of develop bronchiolitis as we know it in man or the horse . 
in_addition , it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized emphysema occur in a cow , consider its marked lobular development but , conversely , not difficult to imagine this occur in the horse or the dog . 
anatomically , the horse lung appear to be remarkably like that of man , insofar as this can be ascertain from comparison of our finding in the horse with those of others ( person , ' 54 ) in the human_being . 
the only area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter be in regard_to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial_artery . 
as early as 1858 , person claim an alveolar distribution of the bronchial_artery in human_being . 
in 1951 , this was reaffirm by person . 
the opposition to this point_of_view have its staunch support in the work of person ( ' 50 ) . 
apparently , however , person has rely_on heavily on the anatomy in dog and cat , and he has been criticize for use pathologic human material in his normal study ( person , ' 38 ) . 
although person note in 1907 that a difference in the pleural blood supply exist between animal , nowhere in his published work is it find that he do a comparative study of the intrapulmonary feature of various mammalian lung other_than in the dog and cat ( person , ' 13 ; ' 25 ) . 
the meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial_artery as find in the horse be not clear . 
however , this artery is know to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal airway and supportive tissue of the lung . 
the alveolus and respiratory bronchiole be primarily diffusing tissue . 
theoretically , they be capable of extract their required oxygen either from the surrounding air ( person and person , ' 13 ) or from pulmonary arterial blood ( person , ' 58 ) . 
therefore , an explanation of this alveolar bronchial_artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased amount of supportive tissue , not primarily diffusing in nature , in the region of the alveolus . 
if this be true , the possibility exist that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial_artery might cause widespread degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that see in generalized emphysema . 
one would not expect such an event to occur in animal possess lung of type 1 , or 2 , . 
the presence of normally occur bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomosis was first note in 1721 by person , and thereafter by many others . 
person ( ' 58 ) , person ( ' 48 ) , person , person and person ( ' 50 ) , person ( ' 53 ) , and person ( ' 52 ) have all claim their normal but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human_being . 
person ( ' 50 ) be the principal antagonist of this viewpoint . 
in criticism of the latter 's view , his conclusion were base upon dog lung injection study in which all_of the vascular channel were first fill with a solution under pressure and then were inject with various sized colored particle design to stop at the arteriolar level . 
as early as 1913 person and person demonstrate with perfusion study in dog that bronchial_artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintain in the pulmonary_artery and pulmonary_vein , but that increase in bronchial_artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary_artery pressure . 
person , person and person in 1931 and person in 1958 reaffirm this . 
our own study in which bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomosis were demonstrate , were accomplish by inject the bronchial_artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary_artery or pulmonary_vein , and then by inject the pulmonary_artery and vein afterwards . 
it be distinctly possible , therefore , that simultaneous pressure in all three vessel would have render the shunt inoperable and hence , uninjectable . 
this viewpoint is further support by person 's ( ' 48 ) demonstration of thickened bronchial_artery and arteriolar muscular coat which be capable of act_as valve . 
in_other_words , the anastomosis between the bronchial_artery and pulmonary_artery should be consider as functional or demand shunt . 
in_addition , little work has been do on a comparative basis in regard_to the normal existence of bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery anastomosis . 
person ( ' 48 ; ' 49 ) find these shunt in the human_being but be unable to find them in rat . 
person , person and person ( ' 52 ) also be unable to find them in rat . 
person ( ' 58 ) be unable to demonstrate their existence , either by anatomic or physiologic method , in dog . 
the possibility that the absence or presence of these shunt be species dependent is therefore infer . 
certainly , the mere fact of fail to demonstrate them in one or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that species . 
it be , however , highly suggestive and agree well with our own finding in which we also fail to demonstrate normally occur bronchial_artery pulmonary_artery shunt in certain species , especially the dog . 
in_conclusion , these finding suggest the need for a comparative physiology , pathology , and histology of mammalian lung . 
in_addition , a detailed interspecies survey of the incidence of generalized pulmonary_emphysema in mammal would be interesting and pertinent . 
also , for the present , great caution should be exercise in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary study if they are to be apply to man . 
this be especially so if the dog , cat or monkey are to be use , in_view_of their marked anatomical difference from man . 
finally , it is suggest that in many respect the horse lung may be anatomically more comparable_to that of the human than any other presently known species . 
the main subgross anatomical feature of the lung of various mammal are present . 
a tabulation of these feature permit the lung to be group into three distinctive subgross type . 
type 1 , is represent by the cow , sheep , and pig ; type 2 , , by the dog , cat , and monkey ; type 3 , , by the horse . 
lobularity be extremely well developed in type 1 , ; absent in type 2 , ; imperfectly developed in type 3 , . 
the pleura and interlobular septum be thick in type 1 , and 3 , . 
the pleura be extremely thin in type 2 , and septum be absent . 
arterial supply to the pleura in type 1 , and 3 , is provide by the bronchial_artery , and in type 2 , , by the pulmonary_artery . 
in type 1 , , 2 , and 3 , the bronchial_artery terminate in a capillary_bed share in common with the pulmonary_artery at the level of the distal bronchiole . 
in type 3 , the bronchial_artery also provide blood directly to the alveolar capillary_bed . 
true terminal bronchiole comprise the most frequent form take_form by the distal airway in type 1 , and 3 , , although small number of poorly developed respiratory bronchiole be present . 
well developed respiratory bronchiole , on_the_other_hand , appear to be the only form take_form by the distal airway in type 2 , . 
in type 1 , the pulmonary_vein closely follow the course of the bronchus and the pulmonary_artery from the periphery to the hilum . 
this maybe due_to the heavy interlobular connective_tissue barrier present . 
in type 3 , this general relationship is maintain peripherally but not centrally where the pulmonary_vein follow a more independent path to the hilum as be the case throughout the lung in type 2 , . 
some of the feature of the top portion of figure 1 and figure 2 were mention in discuss table 1 . 
first , the onset profile spread across approximately 12 year for boy and 10 year for girl . 
in contrast , 20 of the 21 line in the completion profile ( exclude center 5 for boy and 4 for girl ) are bunched and extend over a much short period , approximately 30 month for boy and 40 month for girl . 
the maturity chart for each sex demonstrate clearly that onset be a phenomenon of infancy and early_childhood whereas completion be a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence . 
second , for both sex , the 21 transverse line in the onset profile vary more in individual spread than those in the completion profile . 
although the standard_deviation value on which spread of the line are base be relatively larger for those center which begin to ossify early ( table 1 ) , there are considerable difference in this value between center have the closely timed onset . 
third , the process of calcification is see to begin later and to continue much longer for these boy than for the girl , a fact which confirm data for other group of child . 
the onset profile and completion profile are construct to serve as norm for child . 
it is convenient to classify a child 's onset age and completion age as `` advanced '' , `` moderate '' ( modal ) , or `` delayed '' according_to whether the child 's age equivalent `` dot '' appear to the left of , upon , or to the right of the appropriate short transverse line . 
when a dot appear close to the end of the transverse line , the `` moderate '' rating may be further classify according_to the position of the dot with_respect_to the vertical marking denote the mean age . 
such classification may be call `` somewhat advanced '' or `` somewhat delayed '' , as the case may be , reserve `` moderate '' for dot upon or close to the mean . 
in the lower portion of each chart , the skeletal age ( hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classify . 
there the middle one of the three curve denote `` mean skeletal age '' for the maturity series boy and girl . 
the upper curve denote the mean plus one standard_deviation , and the lower curve represent the mean minus one standard_deviation . 
thus , a child 's skeletal age `` dot '' may be classified as `` advanced '' when they appear above the middle curve , `` moderate '' when they appear immediately above or below the middle curve , and `` delayed '' when they appear below the lower curve . 
to summarize the purpose of the skeletal maturity chart : each contain two kind of skeletal maturity norm which show two quite different method of depict developmental level of growth center . 
first , the upper portion require series of film for every child , consist_of those from hand , elbow , shoulder , knee , and foot . 
the lower portion necessitate only film of hand . 
second , the upper portion permit comparison of maturity level of an equal number of growth center from the long_bone , short_bone , and round_bone of the five region . 
the lower portion permit comparison of maturity level of short_bone and round_bone predominantly , since only two long_bone are include in hand and wrist as a region . 
third , the upper portion deal with only two indicator of developmental level , onset and completion . 
the lower portion utilize the full_complement of intermediate maturity indicator of each hand center as_well_as their onset and completion . 
fourth , the two indicator be for_the_most_part widely separated chronologically , with the extensive age gap occur during childhood for all but one growth center . 
the lower portion provide a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood . 
onset , completion , and skeletal age ( hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compare and classify , use only those skeletal age which appear immediately below the onset profile and the completion profile . 
it may be assume that difference in rating due_to selection of growth center from specific region of the body will be small , according_to existing table of onset age and completion age for center throughout the body . 
accordingly , maturity level rating by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the chart , respectively , should be somewhat similar since skeletal age assessment be dependent upon onset during infancy and upon completion during adolescence . 
it is clear that there are some difference in the rating , but there is substantial agreement . 
since a skeletal age rating can be make at any age during growth , from elbow , shoulder , knee , or foot as_well_as hand , it seem to be the method_of_choice when one wish to study most aspect of skeletal developmental progress during childhood . 
as state earlier in the paper , onset and completion - particularly the former - provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy in osseous development , each within a limited age period . 
such an indicator , or indicator , be needed as means of recognize specific period of delay in skeletal developmental progress . 
it was state earlier that one purpose of this study be to extend the analysis of variability of onset and completion in each of the 21 growth center somewhat beyond that provide by the data in table 1 and 2 . 
as one approach to do this , figure 3 and 4 have been construct from the mean age and the individual onset and completion age for boy 34 and girl 2 . 
the difference between onset age and completion age with_respect_to the corresponding mean age have been bring into juxtaposition by means of a series of arrow . 
the data for boy 34 appear in figure 3 , and for girl 2 in figure 4 . 
the numbering system use in table 1 and 2 and figure 1 and 2 was continue for the 21 growth center . 
the `` dot '' on one end of each arrow indicate extent of difference in month between the child 's onset age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center . 
the `` tip '' of the arrow represent extent of difference between the child 's completion age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center . 
thus , the alignment of the `` dot '' and `` tip '' , respectively , indicate individual variability of the 21 growth center of each child with_respect_to the mean value for these boy and girl . 
the direction in which the arrow point show how the maturity level of the growth center was change at completion from the level at onset . 
when the `` dot '' and `` tip '' coincide , the classification use in this paper be `` same schedule '' . 
the length of the arrow indicate amount of slowing or acceleration at completion over that at onset , and the difference in month can be read roughly by refer the arrow to the age scale along the base of each figure , or more precisely by refer to the original data in the appropriate table . 
the difference between the sequence of onset of ossification for the sex govern the numbering sequence in figure 3 and 4 . 
this difference is readily clarify by refer to table 1 . 
for_example , arrow 17 in figure 3 portray the proximal radial epiphysis for boy 34 , whereas the same epiphysis for girl 2 is portray by arrow 18 in figure 4 . 
for the boy , this epiphysis be markedly delayed at onset but near the mean at completion . 
thus , the span of its ossification was shorten and the center 's ability to `` catch_up '' in ossification is demonstrate . 
in contrast , for the girl the epiphysis be slightly advanced at onset and delayed at completion . 
obviously , the slowing for her may have occur at any point between onset and completion . 
the skeletal age curve in the lower portion of figure 2 show that slowing may have occur for her during the prepubescent period . 
length of the shaft of these arrow may be evaluate according_to the standard_deviation value for each center in table 1 . 
we have attempt to simplify the extensive task of analyze onset age and completion age of each child - more_than 1700 value for the entire group - by construct figure for each of the 21 center so that the data for all 34 boy and 34 of the girl will appear together for each growth center . 
figure 5 and 6 be example of our method of analyze the result for each growth center . 
forty other figure similar to 5 and 6 and the original data use in the construction of all figure and table in this monograph have been include in the appendix . 
the principle use in make each arrow for figure 3 and 4 were apply to the construction of figure 5 and 6 as_well_as all figure in the appendix . 
one growth center in a short_bone - distal phalanx of the second finger - was choose as an example for discussion here , primarily because epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion , the maturity indicator for completion in long_bone and short_bone , occur in this center for girl near the menarche and for boy near their comparable pubescent stage . 
its completion thus become one of the convenient maturity indicator to include in study of growth , dietary pattern , and health during adolescence . 
the following summary , base on figure 5 and 6 , be an example of one way of interpret the 42 figure construct from onset age and completion age of individual child with_respect_to the appropriate mean age for each growth center . 
at the top of figure 5 , for_example , the onset range and completion range line for the chosen growth center have been draw for girl according_to their mean and standard_deviation value in table 1 . 
the 34 arrow , denote onset age plus completion age deviation , have been array in an onset sequence which begin with girl 18 who have the early onset of the 34 girl . 
the growth center depict here , in the distal phalanx of the second finger , is list as the fifth of those in the seven short_bone . 
the mean onset age be 25.3 month ( table 1 ) , and the average span of the osseous stage be 133 month . 
the correlation ( table 2 ) between onset age and completion age be + .50 , and that between onset age and span be - .10 . 
with due consideration for the limit of precision in assess , expected rate of change in ossification of girl age 2 year , and the known variation in rate of ossification of these child as describe in our preceding paper in the supplement , each arrow with a `` shaft length '' of four month or less was select as indicate `` same schedule '' at onset and completion , for this particular epiphysis . 
accordingly , girl 31 , 29 , 33 , 21 , 26 , 13 , 3 , 4 , 14 , 32 , 24 , 25 , 34 , 23 , 6 , 15 , 22 , and 16 may be say to have the `` same schedule '' at onset and completion . 
it seem clear , from the counterbalanced shape of the series of arrow in figure 5 that there was about an equal number of early and late onset and completion for the 34 girl . 
accordingly , if epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion occur in this phalanx near menarche , early and late menarche might have been forecast rather precisely at the time of onset of ossification for the 18 girl with `` same schedule '' . 
as an example of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which exceed four month in shaft length in conjunction with its position in the figure : girl 2 have a delayed onset and further delayed completion . 
it is of interest that her menarche be somewhat late than the average for the girl in this group . 
a similar analysis of figure 6 for the 34 boy would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value of onset age in forecast their attainment of the pubescent stage . 
boy 32 , 23 , 31 , 17 , 30 , 19 , and 24 have `` same schedule '' at onset and completion ; thus early forecasting of the pubescent stage would appear possible for only seven boy . 
boy 34 , like girl 2 , did not have `` same schedule '' ; his arrow cross the line denote the mean . 
the `` dot '' on his arrow indicate early onset and the `` tip '' indicate relatively late completion . 
after the 42 figure had been draw like figure 5 and 6 , classification of the onset age and completion age be summarize from them . 
interestingly enough , the effect of the digitalis_glycoside is inhibit by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhance by the absence of potassium ( person , 1960 ) . 
the precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as_yet completely understand . 
however , the formation of organically bind iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplish in cell-free system . 
in the absence of addition to the homogenate , the product form be an iodinated particulate protein ( person and person , 1953 ; person , person and person , 1955 ; person , person , person , and person , 1956 ; person and person , 1958 ; person and person , 1960 ) . 
this iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what be normally present in the thyroid , and there be no evidence so_far that thyroglobulin can be iodinate in_vitro by cell-free system . 
in_addition , the iodoamino_acid form in largest quantity in the intact thyroid be di-iodotyrosine . 
if tyrosine and a system generate hydrogen_peroxide are add to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantity of free mono-iodotyrosine can be form ( person , 1959 ) . 
it be not clear whether this system bear any resemblance to the in_vivo iodinating mechanism , and a system generate peroxide has not been identify in thyroid tissue . 
on chemical grounds it seem most likely that iodide is first convert to * * f and then to * * f as the active iodinating species . 
in the thyroid_gland it appear that protein ( chiefly thyroglobulin ) be iodinated and that free tyrosine and thyronine be not iodinated . 
iodination of tyrosine , however , be not enough for the synthesis of hormone . 
the mono-iodotyrosine - and di-iodotyrosine must be couple to form tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine . 
the mechanism of this coupling has been study in some detail with nonenzymatic system in_vitro and can be simulate by certain di-iodotyrosine analogue ( person and person , 1958 ) . 
there be so_far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this coupling be under enzymatic control . 
the chemical nature of the iodocompound is discuss below ( pp. 76 et_seq. ) . 
little is know of the synthetic mechanism for formation of thyroglobulin . 
its synthesis has not been demonstrate in cell-free system , nor has its synthesis by system with intact thyroid cell in_vitro been unequivocally prove . 
there be some reason to think that thyroglobulin synthesis may proceed independently of iodination , for in certain transplantable tumour of the rat thyroid contain essentially no iodinated thyroglobulin , a protein that appear to be thyroglobulin has been observe in ultracentrifuge experiment ( person , person and person , 1959 ) . 
similar finding have been note in a patient with congenital absence of the organification enzyme , whose thyroid tissue could only concentrate iodide . 
in_addition , depending_on availability of dietary iodine , thyroglobulin may contain vary quantity of iodine . 
since the circulating thyroid_hormone be the amino_acid thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine ( cf. section c ) , it be clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid_gland for their release from protein before secretion . 
the presence of several protease and peptidase has been demonstrate in the thyroid . 
one of the protease have ph optimum of about 3.7 and another of about 5.7 ( person , person and person , 1954 ; person , person and person , 1955 ) . 
the finding that the concentration of one of these protease is increase in thyroid_gland from tsh treat animal suggest that this protease may be active in_vivo . 
there be no conclusive evidence yet that either of the protease has been prepare in highly purify form nor is their specificity know . 
a study of their activity on thyroglobulin has show that thyroxine is not preferentially release and that the degradation proceed stepwise with the formation of macromolecular intermediate ( person , person and person , 1956 ) . 
besides proteolytic enzyme the thyroid possess de-iodinating enzyme . 
a microsomal de-iodinase with a ph optimum of around 8 , and require reduced triphosphopyridine_nucleotide for activity , has been identify in the thyroid ( person , 1957 ) . 
this de-iodinating enzyme be effective against mono-iodotyrosine - and di-iodotyrosine , but does not de-iodinate thyroxine or tri-iodothyronine . 
it is assume that the iodine release from the iodotyrosine remain in the iodide pool of the thyroid , where it is oxidise and re-incorporate into thyroglobulin . 
the thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine release by proteolysis and so escape de-iodination presumably diffuse into the bloodstream . 
it has been show that thyroglobulin bind thyroxine , but the binding does not appear to be particularly strong . 
it has been suggest that the plasma thyroxine binding protein , which have an extremely high affinity for thyroxine , compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine ( person and person , 1957 ) . 
antithyroid drug be of two general type . 
one type have a small univalent anion of the thiocyanate perchlorate fluoroboride type . 
this ion inhibit thyroid_hormone synthesis by interfere with iodide concentration in the thyroid . 
it does not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism as_such . 
the other group of antithyroid agent or drug is typify by thiouracil . 
these drug have no effect on the iodide concentrate mechanism , but they inhibit organification . 
the mechanism of action of these drug has not been completely work_out , but certain of them appear to act by reduce the oxidised form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin ( person , 1954 ) . 
on_the_other_hand , there be a_few antithyroid drug of this same general type , such as resorcinol , possess no reducing activity and possibly act through formation of a complex with molecular iodine . 
any of the antithyroid drug , of either type , if give in large enough dose for a long period_of_time will cause goitre , owing to inhibition of thyroid_hormone synthesis , with production of hypothyroidism . 
the anterior lobe of the pituitary then respond by an increased output of tsh , cause the thyroid to enlarge . 
the effect of drug that act_on the iodide concentrate mechanism can be counteract by addition of relatively large amount of iodine to the diet . 
the antithyroid drug of the thiouracil type , however , are not antagonise by such means . 
besides those of the thiouracil and resorcinol type , certain antithyroid drug have been find in naturally occur food . 
the most conclusively identify be l - 5 - vinyl - 2 - thio_oxazolidone , which was isolate from rutabaga ( person , 1950 ) . 
it is presume to occur in other member of the brassica family . 
there be some evidence that naturally occur goitrogen may play a role in the development of goitre , particularly in location and location ( person and person , 1956 ) . 
there it seem that the goitrogen ingest by dairy animal be itself inactive but is convert in the animal to an active goitrogen , which is then secrete in the milk . 
besides the presence of goitrogen in the diet , the level of iodine itself in the diet play a major role in govern the activity of the thyroid_gland . 
in the experimental animal and in man gross deficiency in dietary iodine cause thyroid hyperplasia , hypertrophy and increased thyroid activity ( person , person and person , 1952 ; person , person , person , person , person , and person , 1954 ) . 
in man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary to prevent development of goitre be about 100 | mg per day . 
with low level , thyroid hypertrophy and increased thyroid blood flow enable the thyroid to accumulate a larger proportion of the daily intake of iodine . 
further , the gland be able to reuse a larger fraction of the thyroid_hormone de-iodinate peripherally . 
in the presence of a low iodine intake , thyroglobulin label in_vivo with * * f is find to contain more mono-iodotyrosine than normal , the amount of di-iodotyrosine and iodothyronine being correspondingly reduce . 
this appear to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more rapid secretion of newly iodinated thyroglobulin . 
if the deficiency persist long enough , it be reasonable to suppose that the * * f label will reflect the * * f distribution in the thyroglobulin . 
similar result might be expect from the influence of drug or pathological condition that limit iodide trap , or organification , or accelerate thyroglobulin proteolysis . 
the name thyroid-stimulating_hormone ( tsh ) has been give to a substance find in the anterior pituitary_gland of all species of animal so_far test for its presence . 
the hormone has also been called thyrotrophin or thyrotrophic_hormone . 
at the present_time we do not know by what biochemical_mechanism tsh act_on the thyroid , but for bioassay of the hormone there be a number of property by which its activity may be estimate , include release of iodine from the thyroid , increase in thyroid weight , increase in mean height of the follicular cell and increase in the thyroidal uptake of * * f . 
here we shall restrict discussion to those method that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determine the concentration of tsh in blood . 
person ( 1959 ) has review generally the various method of assay tsh , and the reader is refer to her paper for further information on the subject . 
as long_ago as 1851 it was point_out by person ( 1851 ) that there be a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid . 
. 
this connection was clarify by person and person ( 1922 ) , who show that saline extract of fresh bovine pituitary_gland could reactivate the atrophied thyroid of hypophysectomised tadpole . 
the first attempt to isolate tsh come a decade later , when person and person ( 1931 ) use trichloroacetic_acid to separate the soluble tsh from insoluble impurity . 
after their work other investigator apply salt fractionation technique to the problem , as_well_as fractionation with organic solvent , such_as acetone . 
person ( 1949 ) has conclude that the most active preparation of tsh make during this period , from 1931 to 1945 , be probably about 100 to 300 times as potent as the starting material . 
much of this work has been review by person ( 1944 ) and by person ( 1949 ) . 
development up_to about 1957 have been discuss by person ( 1958 ) . 
in the last few year , the application of chromatographic and other modern technique to the problem of isolate tsh has lead to further purification ( person and person , 1960 ; person , person and person , 1960 ) . 
the most active preparation obtain by these two group of investigator appear to be similar in potency , composition and physical_property . 
two problem present themselves in consider any hormone in blood . 
first , be the circulating form of the hormone the same as that find in the gland where it is synthesise and store ? 
second , what be its concentration in normal circumstance and in what circumstance will this concentration depart from the normal level and in which direction ? 
it be therefore necessary to consider the property of pituitary tsh if the fragmentary chemical information about blood tsh is to be discuss rationally . 
the importance of know in what chemical form the hormone may exist is accentuate by the recent observation that there exist an abnormally long-acting tsh in blood draw from many thyrotoxic patient ( person , 1958 ) . 
whether this abnormal tsh differ chemically from pituitary tsh , or be , alternatively , normal tsh with its period of effectiveness modify by some other blood constituent , cannot be decide without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patient and a comparison of the substance responsible_for the blood activity with pituitary tsh . 
in evaluate data on the concentration of tsh in blood , one must examine critically the bioassay method use to obtain them . 
the introduction of the group reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equate of the group and international unit of thyroid stimulate activity have make_possible possible to compare result publish by different investigator since that time . 
we should_like to re-emphasise the importance of state result solely in_terms_of international unit of tsh activity and of avoid the re-introduction of biological unit . 
for_the_most_part , this discussion will be confine to result obtain since the introduction of the reference standard . 
the international unit ( u . ) , adopt to make possible the comparison of result from different laboratory ( person and person , 1955 ) , has been define as the amount of activity present in 13.5 mg of the international_standard_preparation . 
the international unit be equipotent with the group unit adopt in 1952 , which was define as the amount of activity present in 20 mg of the group reference substance . 
muscle weakness is now recognize as an uncommon though serious complication of steroid therapy , with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroid in clinical use . 
although biopsy have show structural change in some of the reported case of steroid induced weakness , this case provide the only example know to us in which necropsy afford the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle group . 
the case describe in this paper be that of an older man who develop disabling muscular weakness while receive a variety of steroid for a refractory anemia . 
this patient be a 65 - year old white male accountant who enter the group for his fourth and terminal admission on june 26 , 1959 , because of disabling weakness and general debility . 
in 1953 the patient develop an unexplained anemia for which 15 blood_transfusion were give over a period of 4 year . 
splenomegaly was first note in 1956 , and a sternal marrow biopsy at that time show `` scattered focus of fibrosis '' suggestive_of myelofibrosis . 
no additional transfusion be necessary after the institution of prednisone in july , 1957 , in an initial dose of 40 mg daily with gradual taper to 10 mg daily . 
this medication was continue until february , 1958 . 
in february , 1958 , the patient suffer a myocardial_infarction complicate by pulmonary edema . 
additional finding at this time include cardiomegaly , peripheral arteriosclerosis_obliterans , and cholelithiasis . 
the hemoglobin be 11.6 gm . 
therapy include digitalization and anticoagulation . 
later , chlorothiazide and salt restriction become necessary to control the edema of chronic congestive failure . 
because of increasing anemia , triamcinolone , 8 mg daily , was start on feb 23 , 1958 , and was continue until july , 1958 . 
in september , 1958 , the patient develop generalized weakness and fatigue which be concurrent with exacerbation of his anemia ; the hemoglobin be 10.6 gm . 
in an attempt to reverse the downhill trend by stimulate the bone_marrow and control any hemolytic component , triamcinolone , 16 mg daily , was begin on sept 26 , 1958 , and continue until feb 18 , 1959 . 
at_first the patient feel strong , and the hemoglobin rise to 13.8 gm , but on oct 20 , 1958 , he complain of `` cave_in '' in his knee . 
by nov 8 , 1958 , weakness , specifically involve the pelvic and thigh musculature , was pronounced , and a common complaint be `` difficulty in step up on to curb '' . 
prednisone , 30 mg daily , was substitute for triamcinolone from nov 22 until dec 1 , 1958 , without any improvement in the weakness . 
serum potassium at this time be 3.8 meq per liter , and the hemoglobin be 13.9 gm by dec 1 , 1958 , the weakness in the pelvic and quadriceps muscle group be appreciably worse , and it become difficult for the patient to rise unaided from a sitting or reclining position . 
triamcinolone , 16 mg daily , was resume and maintain until feb 18 , 1959 . 
chlorothiazide was omit for a 2 - week period , but there be no change in the muscle weakness . 
at this time a detailed neuromuscular examination reveal diffuse muscle atrophy that be moderate in the hand and foot , but more marked in the shoulder , hip , and pelvic_girdle , with hypoactive deep tendon reflex . 
no fasciculation or sensory defect were find . 
electromyography reveal no evidence of lower motor_neuron disease . 
thyroid function test yield normal result . 
the protein bound iodine be 6.6 | mg  , and the radioactive iodine uptake over the thyroid_gland be 46  in 24 hour , with a conversion ratio of 12  . 
a schilling_test demonstrate normal absorption of vitamin * * f . 
in february , 1959 , during the second admission to the group , a biopsy specimen of the left gastrocnemius show striking increase in the sarcolemmal sheath nucleus and shrink muscle_fiber in several section . 
serial serum potassium level remain normal ; the serum glutamic_oxaloacetic_transaminase be 10 unit per ml per min . 
the clinical impression at this time be either muscular_dystrophy or polymyositis . 
on feb 12 , 1959 , purify corticotropin ( acth_gel ) , 20 unit daily intramuscularly , was start but had_to be discontinue 3 week later because of excessive fluid retention . 
from march 3 to may 1 , 1949 , the patient was maintain on dexamethasone , 3 to 6 mg daily . 
in may 1959 , prednisone , 30 mg daily , replace the dexamethasone . 
muscle weakness did not improve , and the patient need first a cane , then crutch . 
in_spite of normal thyroid function test , a trial of propylthiouracil , 400 mg daily for one week , was give but serve only to intensify muscle weakness . 
repeated attempt to withdraw steroid entirely be unsuccessful because increased muscle weakness result , as_well_as fever , malaise , anorexia , anxiety , and an exacerbation of the anemia . 
these reaction were interpret as be manifestation of hypoadrenocorticism . 
severe back pain in june , 1959 , prompt a third hospital admission . 
extensive osteoporosis with partial collapse of d8 was find . 
a high protein diet , calcium_lactate supplement , and norethandrolone fail to change the skeletal complaint or the severe muscle weakness .

the mucosa of the stomach be atrophic and irregularly blacken over a 14 cm area . 
the small_intestine and large_intestine were fill with gas , and the jejunum was dilate to about 2 times its normal circumference . 
the small_intestine and colon contain approximately 300 cc of foul-smelling , sanguineous material , and the mucosa throughout be hyperemic and mottled green brown . 
a careful search fail to show occlusion of any of the mesenteric vessel . 
microscopically , the mucosa of the stomach show extensive cytolysis and contain large_number of gram-negative bacterial rod . 
the submucosa was focally infiltrate with neutrophil . 
the mucosa of the jejunum and ileum show similar change , and in some area the submucosa be edematous and contain considerable number of neutrophil . 
some of the small vessel were fill with fibrin thrombus , and there be extensive interstitial hemorrhage . 
a section of the colon reveal intense hyperemia and extensive focal ulceration of the mucosa , associated with much fibrin and many neutrophil . 
culture take from the jejunum yield monilia_albicans , pseudomonas_pyocanea , aerobacter_aerogenes , and streptococcus_anhemolyticus . 
the kidney be pale and weigh right , 110 gm , and left , 230 gm . 
the surface be coarsely and finely granular and punctuate by clear , fluid filled cyst measure up_to 3 cm in diameter . 
on the surface of the right kidney there be also 2 yellow , firm , friable raised area measure up_to 2 cm in diameter . 
microscopically , both kidney show many small cortical scar in which there be glomerular and interstitial fibrosis , tubular atrophy , and an infiltration of lymphocyte and plasma cell . 
occasional tubule contain hyaline cast admix with neutrophil . 
throughout , there be marked arteriolosclerosis and hyalinization of afferent glomerular arteriole . 
these change be more marked in the atrophic right kidney than in the left . 
in_addition , there be 2 small papillary adenoma in the right kidney . 
the bone of the vertebral body , rib , and sternum be soft and was easily compress . 
the marrow of the vertebral body be pale and show area of fatty replacement . 
microscopically , there be many area of hypercellularity alternate with area of hypocellularity . 
the cell of the erythroid , myeloid , and megakaryocytic series be normal except for their number . 
there be no evidence of fibrosis . 
the muscle of the extremity , chest wall , neck , and abdominal wall be soft , pale , and atrophic . 
microscopic study of the gastrocnemius , pectoralis_major , transversus_abdominis , biceps_brachii , and diaphragm show atrophy as_well_as vary degree of injury range from swelling and vacuolization to focal necrosis of the muscle_fiber . 
these change be most marked in the gastrocnemius and biceps and less evident in the pectoralis , diaphragm , and transversus . 
in the gastrocnemius and biceps there be many swollen and homogeneous necrotic fiber such_as that show in figure 2 . 
such swollen fiber be deeply eosinophilic , contain a_few pyknotic nucleus , and show loss of cross striation , obliteration of myofibril , and prominent vacuolization . 
the necrosis often involve only a portion of the length of a given fiber , and usually the immediately adjacent fiber be normal . 
as show in figure 3 , the protoplasm of other fiber be pale , granular , or flocculate and invade by phagocyte . 
inflammatory cell be strikingly absent . 
in_association_with these change in the fiber , there be striking alteration in the muscle nucleus . 
these were increased both in number and in size , contain prominent nucleolus , and were distribute throughout the fiber ( fig 2 - 5 ) . 
in contrast to the nuclear change describe above , another change in muscle nucleus was see , usually occur in fiber that be somewhat smaller than normal but that show distinct cross striation and myofibrilla . 
the nucleus of these fiber , as is show in figure 3 and 4 , show remarkable proliferation and were closely approximate , form a chain like structure at either the center or the periphery of the fiber . 
individual nucleus be usually oval to round , though occasionally elongate , and frequently small and somewhat pyknotic . 
at_times , clump of 10 to 15 closely packed nucleus were also observe . 
occasionally there be small basophilic fiber that be devoid_of myofibrilla and contain many vesicular nucleus with prominent nucleolus ( fig 5 ) . 
these were think to represent regenerating fiber . 
trichrome stain fail to show fibrosis in the involved muscle . 
in all_of the section examine , the arteriole and small artery be essentially normal . 
in attempt to improve specificity of staining , the fluorescein labeled antiserum use in both direct and indirect method were treat in one of several way : ( 1 ) they were pass_through dowex-2-chloride twice and treat with acetone insoluble powder ( person , 1958 ) prepare from mouse liver or from healthy sweet_clover stem or crown_gall tissue produce by agrobacterium_tumefaciens ( person + person ) location , on sweet_clover stem . 
( 2 ) the conjugate as_well_as the intermediate serum were absorb for 30_minutes with 20 - 50 mg of protein extract from healthy sweet_clover stem . 
the protein were extract with 3 volume of * * f in * * f to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitate by 80  saturation with * * f . 
the precipitate was wash twice with an 80  saturated solution of * * f , dissolve in a small quantity of 0.1 m neutral phosphate buffer , dialyze against cold distilled_water till free from ammonium_ion , and lyophilize use liquid_nitrogen . 
( 3 ) in other experiment the indirect conjugate was treat with 3 volume of ethyl_acetate as recommend by person and person ( 1957 ) . 
( 4 ) the conjugate were pass_through a diethylaminoethyl_cellulose ( deae - ) cellulose column equilibrate with neutral phosphate buffer ( pbs ) contain * * f potassium phosphate and * * f . 
the technique of cutting section be essentially the same as that describe by person et_al. ( 1951 ) . 
root and stem tumor from sweet_clover plant infected with wtv be quick-frozen in liquid_nitrogen , embed in ice , and cut at 3 - 6 | m in a cryostat maintain at - 16 ` to - 20 ` . 
the section were mount on cold slide smear with person ' adhesive ( person , 1940 ) in earlier experiment , and in later experiment with a different mixture of the same component report by person and person ( 1959 ) . 
the latter adhesive was find to be much more satisfactory . 
the section were then thaw by place a finger under the slide and dry under a fan for 30_minutes ; until use they were store for as_long_as 2 week . 
the section were fix in acetone for 15_minutes and dry at 37 ` for 30_minutes . 
some of them were then cover with a drop of * * f in a moist chamber at 24 ` for 30 - 40 minute . 
as control other section were similarly cover with ns . 
section were then wash with pbs for 15 - 30_minutes . 
after blot_out most of the saline around the section , a drop of * * f was layer over each of the section , allow to react for 30_minutes , and then wash with pbs for 15 - 30_minutes . 
after blot_out most of the liquid around the section , the latter were mount in buffer glycerine ( 7 part glycerine to 3 part of pbs ) . 
after dry the section under the fan , fix in acetone , and dry at 37 ` as in the indirect method , the section were treat with conjugated * * f or * * f ( undiluted unless mention otherwise ) for 5 - 30_minutes . 
as control , other section were similarly treat with * * f or conjugated antiserum to the location strain of potato_yellow-dwarf_virus ( person and person , 1956 ) . 
the section were then wash with pbs for 15 - 30_minutes and mount in buffer glycerine . 
stained or unstained section were examine under dark_field_illumination in a zeiss fluorescence microscope equip with a mercury vapor lamp ( osram_hbo 200 ) . 
the light_beam from the lamp was filter through a half standard thickness corning 1840 filter . 
in the eyepiece a wratten 2 b filter was use to filter off residual ultraviolet_light . 
a red filter , zeiss barrier filter with the code ( schott ) designation bg 23 , was also use in the ocular lens assembly as it improve the contrast between specific and nonspecific fluorescence . 
in the first few experiment * * f was pass_through dowex-2-chloride twice and absorb twice with 50 - 100 mg sweet_clover tissue powder . 
the intermediate serum were also similarly absorb with tissue powder . 
section of sweet_clover stem and root tumor were treat with 1 : 10 solution of * * f for 30_minutes , wash in buffer saline for 15_minutes , stain with * * f for 30_minutes , and wash for 15_minutes in pbs . 
such section show bright yellow-green specific fluorescence in the cell of the pseudophloem tissue ( person and person , 1955 ) . 
this specific fluorescence was readily distinguish from the light-green nonspecific fluorescence in consecutive section stain with 1 : 10 dilution of ns and * * f or with * * f alone . 
unstained section mount in buffer glycerine or section treat only with ns or * * f did not show such green fluorescence . 
section of crown_gall tissue similarly stain with either * * f and * * f or ns and * * f also show only the light-green nonspecific fluorescence . 
however , the nonspecific staining by the * * f in tumor section was consider bright enough to be confuse with the staining of small amount of wtv antigen . 
two absorption of * * f with ethyl_acetate or two absorption of * * f ( which had been pass_through dowex-2-chloride ) , ns and * * f with crown_gall tissue powder , or mouse liver powder did not further improve the specificity of staining . 
treatment of all the serum with sweet_clover protein greatly reduce nonspecific fluorescence , especially when the treated conjugate was dilute to 1 : 2 with 0.85  saline . 
in all the above procedure , when the intermediate serum were dilute to 1 : 10 or 1 : 100 with 0.85  saline , the specific and nonspecific fluorescence were not appreciably reduce , whereas , a dilution of the intermediate serum to 1 : 500 or dilute the * * f to 1 : 5 greatly reduce specific fluorescence . 
rinse the section with pbs before layer the intermediate serum did not improve the staining reaction . 
in_addition to other treatment , treat the section with normal sheep serum for half an hour before layer * * f did not reduce nonspecific staining . 
the only treatment by which nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily remove be by pass_through the conjugate through a deae_cellulose column . 
when 1 ml of conjugate was pass_through a column ( * * f ) , the first and second milliliter fraction collect be the most specific and give no nonspecific staining in some experiment , and very little in others . 
in the latter case an additional treatment of the deae cellulose treated * * f with 50 mg of sweet_clover stem tissue powder further improve the specificity . 
after these treatment the conjugate did not stain healthy or crown_gall sweet_clover tissue or stain them a very faint green which be easily distinguishable from the bright yellow-green specific staining . 
with this purified conjugate the best staining procedure consist_of treat the section with 1 : 10 dilution of * * f for 30_minutes , wash with pbs for 15_minutes , stain with * * f for 30_minutes , and wash with pbs for 15_minutes . 
the specificity of staining in wtv tumor with * * f and * * f but not with ns and * * f or with antiserum to potato_yellow-dwarf_virus and * * f , and the absence of such staining in crown_gall tumor tissue from sweet_clover , indicate that an antigen of wtv was being stain . 
* * f was first conjugated with 50 mg of fitc per gram of globulin . 
this conjugate was pass_through twice through dowex-2-chloride and treat with various tissue powder in the same manner as describe for the indirect method . 
in all case a disturbing amount of nonspecific staining be still present although it be still distinguishable from specific fluorescence . 
in later experiment , * * f and * * f were prepare by conjugate 8 mg of fitc per gram of globulin . 
these conjugate * * f have much less nonspecific staining than the previous conjugate ( with 50 mg fitc per gram of globulin ) while the specific staining be similar in both case . 
nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily eliminate by pass_through these conjugate through a deae_cellulose column as describe for * * f . 
the best staining procedure with this purified * * f consist_of stain with the conjugate for 30_minutes and wash in pbs for 15_minutes . 
the specificity of staining with * * f was establish as_follows : * * f specifically stained tumor section but not section of healthy sweet_clover stem or of crown_gall tumor tissue from sweet_clover . 
section of tumor incite by wtv were not similarly stain with conjugated normal serum or conjugated antiserum to potato_yellow-dwarf_virus . 
after pass_through * * f through deae_cellulose , the titer of antibody to wtv in the specific fraction be 1 : 4 of the titer before such passage ( precipitin ring test by person ) ; but mere dilution of the conjugate to 1 : 4 did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific staining . 
this indicate that increase in specificity of * * f after pass_through it through deae_cellulose be_due not merely due_to dilution . 
specific staining by deae_cellulose treat * * f and * * f , although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either nonspecific staining or autofluorescence of cell , was not satisfactorily photograph to show such difference in_spite_of many attempt with black_and_white and color photography . 
this be chiefly because of the bluish white autofluorescence from the cell . 
the autofluorescence from the wall of the xylem cell be particularly brilliant . 
result of specific staining by the direct and the indirect method be similar and show the localization of wtv antigen in certain tissue of tumor . 
the virus antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue . 
frequently a_few isolated thick walled cell or , rarely , group of such cell in the xylem region , were also specifically stain , but there be no such staining in epidermis , cortex , most xylem cell , ray cell , or pith . 
within the pseudophloem cell the distribution of wtv antigen be irregular in the cytoplasm . 
no antigen be detectable in certain dark spherical area in most cell . 
these area be think to represent the nucleus . 
in some tumor section small spherical body , possibly inclusion_body ( person and person , 1952 ) stain more intensely than the rest of cytoplasm and probably contain more antigen . 
in all case study tissue of the stem on which the tumor had develop did not contain detectable amount of wtv antigen . 
in both the direct and indirect method of staining , the conjugate have nonspecifically staining fraction . 
in the indirect method , this be evident from the fact that tumor section were stain light-green even when stain with ns and * * f or with * * f only . 
in the direct method , * * f , not further treat , stain certain tissue of healthy sweet_clover stem nonspecifically and wtv tumor section were similarly stain by comparable * * f . 
after * * f and * * f were pass_through dowex-2-chloride twice and treat twice with healthy sweet_clover tissue powder , nonspecific staining was greatly reduce but a disturbing amount of such staining be still present . 
treatment of the conjugate with ethyl_acetate , and the conjugate ( which had been pass_through dowex-2-chloride ) with mouse liver powder , sweet_clover crown_gall tissue powder , or healthy sweet_clover protein did not satisfactorily remove nonspecifically staining substance in the conjugate . 
such treatment of the conjugate have usually be successful in eliminate nonspecific staining in several other system ( person , 1958 ) . 
person and person ( 1959 ) did not report any such nonspecific staining of plant_tissue with fluorescein isocyanate labeled antiserum to tobacco_mosaic_virus . 
the reason for the failure of these treatment to eliminate nonspecific staining in the conjugate in our system is not know . 
in our work the best procedure for remove substance cause nonspecific staining in_order to obtain specific conjugate was to pass_through the conjugate through a deae_cellulose column and in some case to absorb the first and second milliliter fraction with sweet_clover tissue powder . 
the specific staining by both direct and indirect method show that wtv antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a_few thick walled cell in the xylem region , but be not detectable in any other tissue of the root and stem tumor . 
a study of the distribution of wtv antigen within the pseudophloem cell indicate that it be irregularly distribute in the cytoplasm . 
wound_tumor_virus be a leafhopper transmit virus not easily transmissible by mechanical inoculation ( person , 1944 ; person et_al. , 1954 ) . 
the concentration and apparent localization of the wtv antigen in pseudophloem tissue of the tumor may indicate that the virus preferentially multiply in the phloem and may need to be directly place in this tissue in_order_to infect plant . 
since emotional reaction in the higher vertebrate depend_on individual experience and are arouse in man , in_addition , by complex symbol , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excite from the cortex . 
in experiment with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral_cortex , the transmission of impulse from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrate . 
moreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increase under these condition . 
even more complex and obviously cortically induce form of emotional_arousal could be elicit in monkey a on see monkey b ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress . 
a previously extinguished conditioned_reaction was restore in monkey a and was associate with typical sign of emotional excitement include sympathetic discharge . 
it seem to follow that by_and_large an antagonism exist between the paleocortex - and the neocortex as_far_as emotional reactivity is concern , and that the balance between the two system determine the emotional responsiveness of the organism . 
in_addition , the neocortical hypothalamic relation play a great role in primates , as person 's interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect '' demonstrate . 
but even in relatively primitive laboratory animal such_as the rat , sex_activity closely identify with the hypothalamus and the visceral_brain is enhance by the neocortex . 
person stress correctly the importance of the visceral_brain for preservation of the individual and the species , as evidence by the influence of the limbic_brain ( include the hypothalamus ) on emotion related_to fight and flight and also on sexual function . 
it should be add that in man neocortical hypothalamic interrelation probably play a role in the fusion of emotional process with those underlying perception , memory , imagination , and creativity . 
previous experience be obviously of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional response . 
the visceral_brain as_well_as the neocortex is know to contribute to memory , but this topic be beyond the scope of this paper . 
after this brief discussion of neocortical - , paleocortical , and cortico-hypothalamic relation , let us return once_more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and its physiological and pathological significance . 
facilitatory process take_place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending and descending pathway . 
thus corticofugal discharge induce by topical application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate with spike present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive discharge . 
on_the_other_hand , the temporary reduction in hypothalamic excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior hypothalamus cause a lessening in frequency and amplitude of cortical strychnine spike until the hypothalamic excitability is restore . 
apparently , a positive_feedback exist between the posterior hypothalamus and the cerebral_cortex . 
consequently , if for any reason the hypothalamic excitability fall below the physiological level , the lessened hypothalamic cortical discharge lead to a diminished state of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the corticofugal discharge . 
obviously , a vicious_cycle develop . 
this tendency can be break either by restore hypothalamic excitability directly or via cortico-hypothalamic pathway . 
it is believe that drug therapy and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism . 
before we comment far on these pathological condition , we should remember that change in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological limit distinguish sleep from wakefulness . 
thus , a low intensity of hypothalamic cortical discharge prevail in sleep and a high one during wakefulness , result in synchronous eeg potential in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition . 
moreover , the dominance in parasympathetic action ( with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic ) at the hypothalamic level induce , by its peripheral action , the autonomic symptom of sleep and , by its action on the cortex , a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus of the somatic nervous_system . 
with the dominance of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus , the opposite change occur . 
since electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produce the effect of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induce sleep , it may be say that the reactivity of the whole organism is alter by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus . 
similar effect can be induce reflexly via the baroreceptor reflex in man and animal . 
of particular importance be the study of the action of drug in this respect . 
although no drug act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it , there be sufficient specificity to distinguish drug which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance . 
the former comprise analeptic and psychoactive_drug , the latter the tranquilizer . 
specific difference exist in the action of different drug belong_to the same group as , for_instance , between reserpine and chlorpromazine . 
important as these difference be , they should not obscure the basic fact that by shift the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the parasympathetic side , we produce depression , whereas a shift in the opposite direction cause excitatory effect and , eventually , maniclike change . 
the emotional_state produce by drug influence the cortical_potential in a characteristic manner ; synchrony prevail in the eeg of the experimental animal after administration of tranquilizer , but asynchrony after application of analeptic and psychoactive_drug . 
the shock_therapy act likewise on the hypothalamic balance . 
physiological experiment and clinical observation have show that these procedure influence the hypothalamically controlled hypophyseal secretion and increase sympathetic discharge . 
they shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side . 
this explain the beneficial effect of electroshock_therapy in certain depression and a shift in the reaction from hypo - to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as show by the mecholyl_test . 
some investigator have find a parallelism between remission and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicate by the mecholyl_test and , conversely , between clinical impairment and increasing deviation of this test from the norm . 
nevertheless , the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance have a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patient has not_yet been test on an adequate number of patient . 
the mecholyl and noradrenaline test apply with certain precaution be reliable indicator of this central autonomic balance , but for the sake of correlate autonomic and clinical state , and of study the effect of certain therapeutic procedure on central autonomic reaction , additional test seem to be desirable . 
it was assume that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occur spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patient from the application of certain therapeutic procedure follow the pattern know from the sleep wakefulness cycle . 
a change in the balance to the parasympathetic side lead in the normal individual to sleep or , in special circumstance , to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting . 
in both condition the emotional and perceptual sensitivity be diminished , but no depression occur such_as is see clinically or may be produce in normal person by drug . 
the fundamental difference between physiological and pathological state of parasympathetic ( and also of sympathetic ) dominance remain to be elucidate . 
perhaps a clue to these and related problem lie_in the fact that change in the intensity of hypothalamic discharge which are associate with change in its balance lead also to qualitative alteration in reactivity . 
a state of parasympathetic `` tuning '' of the hypothalamus induce experimentally cause not_only an increase in the parasympathetic reactivity this structure to direct and reflexly induce stimulus , but lead also to an autonomic reversal : a stimulus act sympathetically under control_condition elicit in this state of tuning a parasympathetic response ! 
furthermore , conditioned_reaction are fundamentally alter when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is augment beyond a critical level , and several type of behavioral change probably related_to the degree of central autonomic `` tuning '' are observe . 
if , for_instance , such a change is produced by one or a_few insulin coma or electroshock , previously inhibited conditioned_reaction reappear . 
however , if these procedure are apply more often , conditioned_response emotional response are temporarily abolish . 
in other study , loss of differentiation in previously established conditioned_reflex result from repeated convulsive ( metrazol ) treatment , suggest a fundamental disturbance in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral process . 
it has further been show that : ( 1 ) an experimental neurosis in its initial stage is associate with a reversible shift in the central autonomic balance ; ( 2 ) drug alter the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned_reaction ; ( 3 ) in a state of depression , the positive conditioned_stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned_reaction but cause an increased synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing ( alerting ) effect on the eeg . 
these be few and seemingly disjointed data , but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alteration in conditioned_reaction occur in a variety of state in which the hypothalamic balance has been alter by physiological experimentation , pharmacological action , or clinical process . 
the foregoing remark imply that the hypothalamic balance play a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological form of emotion . 
if this be the case , one would expect that not_only the various procedure just mention which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional_state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise . 
we point_out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic_disorder and neurotic symptom , particularly in certain type of personality , but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion ( `` abreaction '' ) may cure a battle neurosis . 
this phenomenon raise the question whether the guidance of the emotion for therapeutic end may_not have an even wide application in the area of the neurosis . 
be a strictly physiological procedure , one may expect from such a study additional information on the nature of the emotional process itself . 
person 's experiment and therapeutic work lie_in this area . 
he show convincingly that anxiety be a learned_reaction ( conditioned_reaction and be the basis of experimental and clinical neurosis and assume , therefore , that the neuronal change which underlie the neurosis be functional and reversible . 
an important observation of person serve as a guidepost to achieve such a reversibility by physiological means . 
in a conditioning experiment , he demonstrate the antagonism between feeding and pain . 
a mild electrical_shock serve as a conditioned_stimulus and was follow by feeding . 
the pain become thus the symbol for food and elicit salivary secretion ( conditioned_reflex ) . 
even when the intensity of the shock was increase gradually , it fail to evoke any sign of pain . 
since strong nociceptive stimulus produce an experimental neurosis during which the animal fail to eat in the experimental situation , person think that he could utilize the feeding pain antagonism to inhibit the neurotic symptom through feeding . 
appropriate experiment show that this be , indeed , possible . 
he then apply this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neurosis . 
he take advantage of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness and anxiety and find a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former attitude was establish . 
for the interpretation of these significant investigation , it should be remember that reciprocal relation exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic function which are closely associate with the emotion . 
the feeding pain antagonism seem to be based on this reciprocal relation between the trophotropic - and ergotropic system . 
furthermore , a functional antagonism exist between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety . 
although in both emotion sympathetic symptom be present , different autonomic somatic pattern underlie aggression and anxiety , respectively , as indicate by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamine , the state of the muscle_tone , and the mecholyl_test . 
the psychological incompatibility of these emotional_state seem to be reflect in , or base on , this marked difference . 
in our attempt to interpret the emotion in their physiological and pathological range , we emphasize the importance of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic division of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory system , respectively . 
we stress the reciprocal relation of these system with respect to the autonomic somatic downward discharge as_well_as regard the hypothalamic cortical discharge . 
although we be still far from a complete understanding of these problem , as a first approximation , it is suggest that alteration in the hypothalamic balance with consequent change in the hypothalamic cortical discharge account_for major change in behavior see in various mood and state of emotion in man and beast under physiological circumstance , in experimental and clinical neurosis , and as the result of psychopharmacological agent . 
in_view_of the important role which emotional_disturbance play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorder and the parallelism observe between autonomic state and psychological behavior in several instance , it is further suggest that a hypothalamic imbalance may play an important role in initiate mental change . 
we are try to study a linear_operator t on the finite dimensional space v , by decompose t into a direct_sum of operator which be in some sense elementary . 
we can do this through the characteristic value and vector of t in certain special case , i.e. , when the minimal polynomial for t factor over the scalar_field f into a product of distinct monic_polynomial of degree 1 . 
what can we do with the general t ? 
if we try to study t use characteristic value , we are confront with two problem . 
first , t may not have a single characteristic value ; this be really a deficiency in the scalar_field , namely , that it be not algebraically closed . 
second , even if the characteristic polynomial factor completely over f into a product of polynomial of degree 1 , there may not be enough characteristic vector for t to span the space v ; this be clearly a deficiency in t . 
the second situation is illustrate by the operator t on * * f ( f any field ) represent in the standard basis by * * f . 
the characteristic polynomial for a be * * f and this be plainly also the minimal polynomial for a ( or for t ) . 
thus t be not diagonalizable . 
one see that this happen because the null_space of * * f have dimension 1 only . 
on_the_other_hand , the null_space of * * f and the null_space of * * f together span v , the former be the subspace span by * * f and the latter the subspace span by * * f and * * f . 
this will be more_or_less our general method for the second problem . 
if ( remember this be an assumption ) the minimal polynomial for t decompose * * f where * * f be distinct element of f , then we shall show that the space v be the direct_sum of the null_space of * * f . 
the diagonalizable operator be the special case of this in which * * f for each i . 
the theorem which we prove be more general than what we have describe , since it work with the primary decomposition of the minimal polynomial , whether or not the prime which enter be all of first degree . 
the reader will find it helpful to think_of the special case when the prime be of degree 1 , and even more particularly , to think_of the proof of theorem 10 , a special case of this theorem . 
let t be a linear_operator on the finite dimensional vector space v over the field f . 
let p be the minimal polynomial for t , * * f where the * * f be distinct irreducible monic_polynomial over f and the * * f be positive integer . 
let * * f be the null_space of * * f . 
then ( a ) * * f ( b ) each * * f be invariant under t ( c ) if * * f be the operator induce on * * f by t , then the minimal polynomial for * * f be * * f . 
the idea of the proof be this . 
if the direct_sum decomposition ( a ) be valid , how can we get hold of the projection * * f associate with the decomposition ? 
the projection * * f will be the identity on * * f and zero on the other * * f . 
we shall find a polynomial * * f such_that * * f be the identity on * * f and be zero on the other * * f , and so that * * f , etc. . 
for each i , let * * f . 
since * * f be distinct prime polynomial , the polynomial * * f be relatively prime ( theorem 8 , chapter 4 ) . 
thus there be polynomial * * f such_that * * f . 
note also that if * * f , then * * f be divisible_by the polynomial p , because * * f contain each * * f as a factor . 
we shall show that the polynomial * * f behave in the manner describe in the first paragraph of the proof . 
let * * f . 
since * * f and p divide * * f for * * f , we have * * f . 
thus the * * f be projection which correspond to some direct_sum decomposition of the space v . 
we wish to show that the range of * * f be exactly the subspace * * f . 
it is clear that each vector in the range of * * f be in * * f for if |a be in the range of * * f , then * * f and so * * f because * * f be divisible_by the minimal polynomial p . 
conversely , suppose that |a be in the null_space of * * f . 
if * * f , then * * f be divisible_by * * f and so * * f , i.e. , * * f . 
but then it be immediate that * * f , i.e. , that |a be in the range of * * f . 
this complete the proof of statement ( a ) . 
it be certainly clear that the subspace * * f be invariant under t . 
if * * f be the operator induce on * * f by t , then evidently * * f , because by definition * * f be 0 on the subspace * * f . 
this show that the minimal polynomial for * * f divide * * f . 
conversely , let g be any polynomial such_that * * f . 
then * * f . 
thus * * f be divisible_by the minimal polynomial p of t , i.e. , * * f divide * * f . 
it is easily see that * * f divide g . 
hence the minimal polynomial for * * f be * * f . 
if * * f be the projection associate with the primary decomposition of t , then each * * f be a polynomial in t , and accordingly if a linear_operator u commute with t then u commute with each of the * * f i.e. , each subspace * * f be invariant under u . 
in the notation of the proof of theorem 12 , let us take_a_look at the special case in which the minimal polynomial for t be a product of first degree polynomial , i.e. , the case in which each * * f be of the form * * f . 
now the range of * * f be the null_space * * f of * * f . 
let us put * * f . 
by theorem 10 , d be a diagonalizable operator which we shall call the diagonalizable part of t . 
let us look_at the operator * * f . 
now * * f * * f so * * f . 
the reader should be familiar_with enough with projection by now so that he see that * * f and in_general that * * f . 
when * * f for each i , we shall have * * f , because the operator * * f will then be 0 on the range of * * f . 
let n be a linear_operator on the vector space v . 
we say that n be nilpotent if there be some positive integer r such_that * * f . 
let t be a linear_operator on the finite dimensional vector space v over the field f . 
suppose that the minimal polynomial for t decompose over f into a product of linear polynomial . 
then there be a diagonalizable operator d on v and a nilpotent operator n on v such_that ( a ) * * f , ( b ) * * f . 
the diagonalizable operator d and the nilpotent operator n are uniquely determine by ( a ) and ( b ) and each of them be a polynomial in t . 
we have just observe that we can write * * f where d be diagonalizable and n be nilpotent , and where d and n not_only commute but be polynomial in t . 
now suppose that we also have * * f where d ' be diagonalizable , n ' be nilpotent , and * * f . 
we shall prove that * * f . 
since d ' and n ' commute with one another and * * f , we see that d ' and n ' commute with t . 
thus d ' and n ' commute with any polynomial in t ; hence they commute with d and with n . 
now we have * * f or * * f and all four of these operator commute with one another . 
since d and d ' be both diagonalizable and they commute , they be simultaneously diagonalizable , and * * f be diagonalizable . 
since n and n ' be both nilpotent and they commute , the operator * * f be nilpotent ; for , use the fact that n and n ' commute * * f and so when r be sufficiently large every term in this expression for * * f will be 0 . 
( actually , a nilpotent operator on an n-dimensional space must have its nth power 0 ; if we take * * f above , that will be large enough . 
it then follow that * * f be large enough , but this be not obvious from the above expression . ) 
now * * f be a diagonalizable operator which be also nilpotent . 
such an operator be obviously the zero operator ; for since it be nilpotent , the minimal polynomial for this operator be of the form * * f for some * * f ; but then since the operator be diagonalizable , the minimal polynomial cannot have a repeated root ; hence * * f and the minimal polynomial be simply x , which say the operator be 0 . 
thus we see that * * f and * * f . 
let v be a finite dimensional vector space over an algebraically closed field f , e.g. , the field of complex_number . 
then every linear_operator t on v can be write as the sum of a diagonalizable operator d and a nilpotent operator n which commute . 
these operator d and n be unique and each be a polynomial in t . 
from these result , one see that the study of linear_operator on vector space over an algebraically closed field is essentially reduce to the study of nilpotent operator . 
for vector space over non algebraically closed field , we still need to find some substitute for characteristic value and vector . 
it be a very interesting fact that these two problem can be handle simultaneously and this be what we shall do in the next chapter . 
in conclude this section , we should_like to give an example which illustrate some of the idea of the primary decomposition theorem . 
we have choose to give it at the end of the section since it deal with differential_equation and thus be not purely linear_algebra . 
in the primary decomposition theorem , it be not necessary that the vector space v be finite dimensional , nor be it necessary for part ( a ) and ( b ) that p be the minimal polynomial for t . 
if t be a linear_operator on an arbitrary vector space and if there be a monic_polynomial p such_that * * f , then part ( a ) and ( b ) of theorem 12 be valid for t with the proof which we give . 
let n be a positive integer and let v be the space of all n times continuously differentiable function f on the real line which satisfy the differential_equation * * f where * * f be some fixed constant . 
if * * f denote the space of n times continuously differentiable function , then the space v of solution of this differential_equation be a subspace of * * f . 
if d denote the differentiation operator and p be the polynomial * * f then v be the null_space of the operator p ( d ) , because * * f simply say * * f . 
let us now regard d as a linear_operator on the subspace v . 
then * * f . 
if we are discuss differentiable complex valued function , then * * f and v be complex vector space , and * * f may be any complex_number . 
we now write * * f where * * f be distinct complex_number . 
if * * f be the null_space of * * f , then theorem 12 say that * * f . 
in_other_words , if f satisfy the differential_equation * * f , then f be uniquely expressible in the form * * f where * * f satisfy the differential_equation * * f . 
thus , the study of the solution to the equation * * f is reduce to the study of the space of solution of a differential_equation of the form * * f . 
this reduction has been accomplish by the general method of linear_algebra , i.e. , by the primary decomposition theorem . 
to describe the space of solution to * * f , one must know something about differential_equation , that_is , one must know something about d other_than the fact that it be a linear_operator . 
however , one does not need to know very_much . 
it be very easy to establish by induction on r that if f be in * * f then * * f that_is , * * f , etc. . 
thus * * f if and only if * * f . 
a function g such_that * * f , i.e. , * * f , must be a polynomial function of degree * * f or less : * * f . 
thus f satisfy * * f if and only if f have the form * * f . 
accordingly , the ' function ' * * f span the space of solution of * * f . 
since * * f be linearly independent function and the exponential_function have no zero , these r function * * f , form a basis for the space of solution . 
some experiment be composed of repetition of independent trial , each with two possible outcome . 
the binomial_distribution probability distribution may describe the variation that occur from one set of trial of such a binomial experiment to another . 
we devote a chapter to the binomial_distribution not_only because it be a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real_life phenomenon , but also because it have important property that recur in many other probability model . 
we begin with a_few example of binomial experiment . 
a trained marksman shoot five round at a target , all under practically the same condition , may hit the bull's_eye from 0 to 5 time . 
in repeat set of five shot his number of bull's_eye vary . 
what can we say of the probability of the different possible number of bull's_eye ? 
in litter of eight mouse from similar parent , the number of mouse with straight instead of wavy hair be an integer from 0 to 8 . 
what probability should be attach to these possible outcome ? 
when three dice are toss repeatedly , what be the probability that the number of ace be 0 ( or 1 , or 2 , or 3 ) ? 
more generally , suppose that an experiment consist_of a number of independent trial , that each trial result in either a `` success '' or a `` non success '' ( `` failure '' ) , and that the probability of success remain constant from trial to trial . 
in the example above , the occurrence of a bull's_eye , a straight haired mouse , or an ace could be call a `` success '' . 
in_general , any outcome we choose may be label `` success '' . 
the major question in this chapter be : what be the probability of exactly x success in n trial ? 
in chapter 3 and 4 we answer question like those in the example , usually by count point in a sample space . 
fortunately , a general formula of wide applicability solve all problem of this kind . 
before derive this formula , we explain what we mean by `` problem of this kind '' . 
experiment are often compose of several identical trial , and sometimes experiment themselves are repeat . 
in the marksmanship example , a trial consist_of `` one round shoot at a target '' with outcome either one bull's_eye ( success ) or none ( failure ) . 
further , an experiment might consist_of five round , and several set of five round might be regard_as a super experiment compose of several repetition of the five round experiment . 
if three dice are toss , a trial be one toss of one die and the experiment is composed of three trial . 
or , what amount to the same thing , if one die is toss three time , each toss be a trial , and the three toss form the experiment . 
mathematically , we shall not distinguish the experiment of three dice toss once from that of one die toss three time . 
these example be illustrative of the use of the word `` trial '' and `` experiment '' as they are use in this chapter , but they be quite flexible word and it be well not to restrict them too narrowly . 
ten student act_as manager for a high_school football_team , and of these manager a proportion p be licensed driver . 
each friday one manager is choose by lot to stay late and load the equipment on a truck . 
on three friday the coach has need a driver . 
consider only these friday , what be the probability that the coach have driver all 3 time ? 
exactly 2 time ? 
1 time ? 
0 time ? 
note that there be 3 trial of interest . 
each trial consist_of choose a student manager at_random . 
the 2 possible outcome on each trial be `` driver '' or `` nondriver '' . 
since the choice be by lot each_week , the outcome of different trial be independent . 
the manager stay the same , so that * * f be the same for all week . 
we now generalize these idea for general binomial experiment . 
for an experiment to qualify as a binomial experiment , it must have four property : ( 1 ) there must be a fixed number of trial , ( 2 ) each trial must result in a `` success '' or a `` failure '' ( a binomial trial ) , ( 3 ) all trial must have identical probability of success , ( 4 ) the trial must be independent of each other . 
below we use our earlier example to describe and illustrate these four property . 
we also give , for each property , an example where the property be absent . 
the language and notation introduce be standard throughout the chapter . 
for the marksman , we study set of five shot ( * * f ) ; for the mouse , we restrict attention to litter of eight ( * * f ) ; and for the ace , we toss three dice ( * * f ) . 
toss a die until an ace appear . 
here the number of trial be a random_variable , not a fixed number . 
each of the n trial be either a success or a failure . 
`` success '' and `` failure '' be just convenient label for the two category of outcome when we talk_about binomial trial in_general . 
these word be more expressive than label like `` a '' and `` not - a '' . 
it be natural from the marksman 's viewpoint to call a bull's_eye a success , but in the mouse example it be arbitrary which category correspond to straight hair in a mouse . 
the word `` binomial '' mean `` of two name '' or `` of two term '' , and both usage apply in our work : the first to the name of the two outcome of a binomial trial , and the second to the term p and * * f that represent the probability of `` success '' and `` failure '' . 
sometimes when there be many outcome for a single trial , we group these outcome into two class , as in the example of the die , where we have arbitrarily construct the class `` ace '' and `` not ace '' . 
we classify mouse as `` straight haired '' or `` wavy haired '' , but a hairless mouse appear . 
we can escape_from such a difficulty by rule_out the animal as not constitute a trial , but such a solution be not always satisfactory . 
each die have probability * * f of produce an ace ; the marksman have some probability p , perhaps 0.1 , of make a bull's_eye . 
note that we need not know the value of p , for the experiment to be binomial . 
during a round of target_practice the sun come from behind a cloud and dazzle the marksman , lower his chance of a bull's_eye . 
strictly_speaking , this mean that the probability for each possible outcome of the experiment can be compute by multiply together the probability of the possible outcome of the single binomial trial . 
thus in the three dice example * * f , * * f , and the independence assumption imply that the probability that the three dice fall ace , not ace , ace in that order be ( 1 6 ) ( 5 6 ) ( 1 6 ) . 
experimentally , we expect independence when the trial have nothing to do with one another . 
a family of five plan to go together either to the beach or to the mountain , and a coin is toss to decide . 
we want to know the number of people go_to the mountain . 
when this experiment is view_as compose of five binomial trial , one for each member of the family , the outcome of the trial be obviously not independent . 
indeed , the experiment is better view_as consist_of one binomial trial for the entire family . 
the following be a less extreme example of dependence . 
consider couple visit an art museum . 
each person vote for one of a pair of picture to receive a popular prize . 
vote for one picture may be call `` success '' , for the other `` failure '' . 
an experiment consist_of the voting of one couple , or two trial . 
in repetition of the experiment from couple to couple , the vote of the two person in a couple probably agree more often than independence would imply , because couple who visit the museum together be more likely to have similar taste than be a random pair of people draw from the entire population of visitor . 
table 7 - 1 illustrate the point . 
the table show that 0.6 of the boy and 0.6 of the girl vote for picture a . 
therefore , under independent voting , * * f or 0.36 of the couple would cast two vote for picture a , and * * f or 0.16 would cast two vote for picture b . 
thus in independent voting , * * f or 0.52 of the couple would agree . 
but table 7 - 1 show that * * f or 0.70 agree , too many for independent voting . 
each performance of an n-trial binomial experiment result in some whole_number from 0 through n as the value of the random_variable x , where * * f . 
we want to study the probability function of this random_variable . 
for_example , we be interested in the number of bull's_eye , not which shot be bull's_eye . 
a binomial experiment can produce random_variable other_than the number of success . 
for_example , the marksman get 5 shot , but we take his score to be the number of shot before his first bull's_eye , that_is , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ( or 5 , if he get no bull's_eye ) . 
thus we do not score the number of bull's_eye , and the random_variable be not the number of success . 
the constancy of p and the independence be the condition most likely to give trouble in_practice . 
obviously , very slight change in p do not change the probability much , and a slight lack of independence may not make an appreciable difference . 
( for_instance , see example 2 of section 5 - 5 , on red card in hand of 5 . ) 
on_the_other_hand , even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical_phenomenon being study , the binomial model may still be use as a baseline for comparative purpose ; that_is , we may discuss the phenomenon in_terms_of its departure from the binomial model . 
a binomial experiment consist_of * * f independent binomial trial , all with the same probability * * f of yield a success . 
the outcome of the experiment be x success . 
the random_variable x take the value * * f with probability * * f or , more briefly * * f . 
we shall find a formula for the probability of exactly x success for given value of p and n . 
when each number of success x is pair with its probability of occurrence * * f , the set of pair * * f , be a probability function called a binomial_distribution . 
the choice of p and n determine the binomial_distribution uniquely , and different choice always produce different distribution ( except when * * f ; then the number of success be always 0 ) . 
the set of all binomial_distribution is call the family of binomial_distribution , but in general discussion this expression is often shorten to `` the binomial_distribution '' , or even `` the binomial '' when the context be clear . 
binomial_distribution were treat by person about 1700 , and for this reason binomial trial are sometimes called person trial . 
each binomial trial of a binomial experiment produce either 0 or 1 success . 
therefore each binomial trial can be think_of as produce a value of a random_variable associate with that trial and take the value 0 and 1 , with probability q and p respectively . 
the several trial of a binomial experiment produce a new random_variable x , the total number of success , which be just the sum of the random_variable associate with the single trial . 
the marksman get two bull's_eye , one on his third shot and one on his fifth . 
the number of success on the five individual shot be , then , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 . 
the number of success on each shot be a value of a random_variable that have value 0 or 1 , and there be 5 such random_variable here . 
their sum be x , the total number of success , which in this experiment have the value * * f . 
consider a simple , closed , plane curve c which be a real analytic image of the unit circle , and which is give by **f . 
these be real analytic periodic function with period t . 
in the following paper it is show that in a certain definite sense , exactly an odd number of square can be inscribe in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed square . 
this theorem be similar to the theorem of person that there exist a circumscribe cube around any closed , bounded convex set in **f . 
the latter theorem has been generalize by person and person , and person to show that in **f there be family of such cube . 
here , for the case of square inscribed in plane curve , we remove the restriction to convexity and give certain other result . 
a square inscribed in a curve c mean a square with its four corner point on the curve , though it may_not lie entirely in the interior of c . 
indeed , the spiral **f , with the two endpoint connected by a straight_line possess only one inscribed square . 
the square have one corner point on the straight_line segment , and does not lie entirely in the interior . 
on c , from the point p at **f to the point q at **f , we construct the chord , and upon the chord as a side erect a square in such a way that as s approach zero the square be inside c . 
as s increase we consider the two free corner point of the square , **f and **f , adjacent to p and q respectively . 
as s approach t the square will be outside c and therefore both **f and **f must cross c an odd number of time as s vary from zero to t . 
the point may also touch c without cross . 
suppose **f cross c when **f . 
we now have certain square with three corner on c . 
for any such square the middle corner of these will be call the vertex of the square and the corner not on the curve will be call the diagonal point of the square . 
each point on c , as a vertex , may possess a finite number of corresponding diagonal point by the above construction . 
to each paired vertex and diagonal point there correspond a unique forward corner point , i.e. , the corner on c reach first by proceed along c from the vertex in the direction of increasing t . 
if the vertex be at **f , and if the interior of c be on the left as one move in the direction of increasing t , then every such corner can be find from the curve obtain by rotate c clockwise through 90 ` about the vertex . 
the set of intersection of **f , the rotated curve , with the original curve c consist_of just the set of forward corner point on c correspond to the vertex at **f , plus the vertex itself . 
we note that two such curve c and **f , cannot coincide at more_than a finite number of point ; otherwise , be analytic , they would coincide at all point , which be impossible since they do not coincide near **f . 
with each vertex we associate certain numerical value , namely the set of positive difference in the parameter t between the vertex and its corresponding forward corner point . 
for the vertex at **f , these value will be denote by **f . 
the function f ( t ) define in this way be multi valued . 
we consider now the graph of the function f ( t ) on **f . 
we will refer to the plane of c and **f as the c-plane and to the plane of the graph as the f-plane . 
the graph , as a set , may have a finite number of component . 
we will denote the value of f ( t ) on different component by **f . 
each point with abscissa t on the graph represent an intersection between c and **f . 
there be two type of such intersection , depend essentially on whether the curve cross at the point_of_intersection . 
an ordinary point will be any point_of_intersection a such_that in every neighborhood of a in the c-plane , **f meet both the interior and the exterior of c . 
any other point_of_intersection between c and **f will be call a tangent point . 
this terminology will also be apply to the corresponding point in the f-plane . 
we can now prove several lemma . 
in some neighborhood in the f-plane of any ordinary point of the graph , the function f be a single valued , continuous function . 
we first show that the function be single valued in some neighborhood . 
with the vertex at **f in the c-plane we assume that **f be the parametric location on c of an ordinary intersection q between c and **f . 
in the f-plane the coordinate of the corresponding point be **f . 
we know that in the c-plane both c and **f be analytic . 
in the c-plane we construct a set of rectangular cartesian coordinate u , v with the origin at q and such_that both c and **f have finite slope at q . 
near q , both curve can be represent by analytic function of u . 
in a neighborhood of q the difference between these function be also a single valued , analytic function of u . 
furthermore , one can find a neighborhood of q in which the difference function be monotone , for since it be analytic it can have only a finite number of extremum in any interval . 
now , to find **f , one needs the intersection of c and **f near q . 
but **f be just the curve **f translate without rotation through a small arc , for **f is always obtain by rotate c through exactly 90 ` . 
the arc be itself a segment of an analytic curve . 
thus if e be sufficiently small , there can be only one intersection of c and **f near q , for if there be more than one intersection for every e then the difference between c and **f near q would not be a monotone function . 
therefore , **f be single valued near q . 
it is also see that **f , since the change from **f to **f is accomplish by a continuous translation . 
thus **f be also continuous at **f , and in a neighborhood of **f which does not contain a tangent point . 
we turn now to the set of tangent point on the graph . 
this set must consist_of isolated point and closed_interval . 
the fact that there can not be any limit_point of the set except in closed_interval follow from the argument use in lemma 1 , namely , that near any tangent point in the c-plane the curve c and **f be analytic , and therefore the difference between them must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point . 
this prevent the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent point . 
in some neighborhood of an isolated tangent point in the f-plane , say **f , the function **f be either double valued or have no value define , except at the tangent point itself , where it be single valued . 
a tangent point q in the c-plane occur when c and **f be tangent to one another . 
a continuous change in t through an amount e result in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve **f . 
there be three possibility : ( a ) **f remain tangent to c as it is translate ; ( b ) **f move away from c and does not intersect it at_all for **f ; ( c ) **f cut_across c and there be two ordinary intersection for every t in **f . 
the first possibility result in a closed_interval of tangent point in the f-plane , the end_point of which fall_into category ( b ) or ( c ) . 
in the second category the function **f have no value define in a neighborhood **f . 
in the third category the function be double valued in this interval . 
the same remark apply to an interval on the other side of **f . 
again , the analyticity of the two curve guarantee that such interval exist . 
in the neighborhood of an end_point of an interval of tangent point in the f-plane the function be two valued or no valued on one side , and be a single valued function consist_of entirely of tangent point on the other side . 
with the above result we can make the following remark about the graph of f . 
first , for any value of t for which all value of f ( t ) be ordinary point the number of value of f ( t ) must be odd . 
for it be clear that the total number of ordinary intersection of c and **f must be even ( otherwise , start in the interior of c , **f could not finally return to the interior ) , and the center of rotation at t be the argument of the function , not a value . 
therefore , for any value of t the number of value of f ( t ) be equal to the ( finite ) number of tangent point correspond to the argument t plus an odd number . 
the number of ordinary value of the function f ( t ) at t will be call its multiplicity at t . 
the graph of f have at_least one component whose support be the entire interval [ 0 , t ] . 
we suppose not . 
then every component of the graph of f must be define over a bounded sub-interval . 
suppose **f is define in the sub-interval **f . 
now **f and **f must both be tangent point on the nth component in the f-plane ; otherwise by lemma 1 the component would extend beyond these point . 
further , we see by lemma 2 that the multiplicity of f can only change at a tangent point , and at such a point can only change by an even integer . 
thus the multiplicity of **f for a given t must be an even number . 
this be true of all component which have such a bounded support . 
but this be a contradiction , for we know that the multiplicity of f ( t ) be odd for every t . 
we have show that the graph of f contain at_least one component whose inverse be the entire interval [ 0 , t ] , and whose multiplicity be odd . 
there must be an odd number of such component , which will be call complete component . 
the remaining ( incomplete ) component all have an even number of ordinary point at any argument , and are define only on a proper sub-interval of [ 0 , t ] . 
we must now show that on some component of the graph there exist two point for which the corresponding diagonal point in the c-plane be on opposite side of c . 
we again consider a fixed point p at **f and a variable point q at **f on c . 
we erect a square with pq as a side and with free corner **f and **f adjacent to p and q respectively . 
as s vary from zero to t , the value of s for which **f and **f cross c will be denote by **f and **f respectively . 
we have **f , plus tangent point . 
these s-values be just the ordinary value of **f . 
the value **f be the ordinary value at **f of a multi valued function g ( t ) which have component correspond to those of f ( t ) . 
we first define a function b ( t ) as_follows : given the set of square such_that each have three corner on c and vertex at t , b ( t ) be the corresponding set of positive parametric difference between t and the backward corner point . 
the function f and b have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument t . 
now with p fixed at **f , **f-values occur when the corner **f cross c , and be among the value of s such_that **f . 
the root of this equation be just the ordinate of the intersection of the graph of b with a straight_line of unit slope through **f in the b-plane ( the plane of the graph of b ) . 
we define these value as **f , and define g ( t ) in the same way for each t . 
thus we obtain g ( t ) by introduce an oblique g ( t ) - axis in the b-plane . 
these society can expect to face difficult time . 
as the historic process of modernization gradually gain momentum , their cohesion will be threaten by divisive force , the gap between ruler and subject , town and country , will widen ; new aspirant for power will emerge whose ambition far exceed their competence ; old ruler may lose their nerve and their sense_of_direction . 
national_leader will have_to display the highest skill of statesmanship to guide their people through time of uncertainty and confusion which destroy man 's sense of identity . 
feeling of a community of interest will have_to be recreate - in some of the new nation , indeed , they must be build for_the_first_time - on a new basis which look toward the future and does not rely_on only on shared memory of the past . 
nevertheless , with foresight and careful planning , some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequence of social change which have trouble other country pass_through this stage can be escape . 
the united_states can help by communicate a genuine concern with the problem these country face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate form of assistance where possible . 
our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these society to tackle boldly the task which they face . 
at_the_same_time , we should recognize that the obstacle to change and the lack of cohesion and stability which characterize these country may make them particularly prone to diversion and external adventure of all sort . 
it may seem to some of them that success can be purchase much less dearly by fish in the murky water of international politics than by face_up to the intractable task at_home . 
we should do what we can to discourage this conclusion , both by offer assistance for their domestic need and by react firmly to irresponsible action on the world scene . 
when necessary , we should make it clear that country which choose to derive marginal advantage from the cold_war or to exploit their potential for disrupt the security of the world will not_only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospect for orderly development . 
as a nation , we feel an obligation to assist other country in their development ; but this obligation pertain only to country which are honestly seek to become responsible member of a stable and forward-moving world community . 
when we look_at country like iran , iraq , pakistan , and burma , where substantial progress has been make in create a minimum supply of modern_man and of social overhead capital , and where institution of centralized government exist , we find a second category of country with a different set of problem and hence different priority for policy . 
the man in power are commit in_principle to modernization , but economic and social change are proceed only erratically . 
isolated enterprise have been launch , but they are not_yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern . 
the society be likely to be characterize by have a fairly modernized urban sector and a relatively untouched rural sector , with very poor communication between the two . 
progress is impede by psychological inhibition to effective action among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resource , human and material , can be mobilize to achieve the national goal of modernization already symbolically accept . 
most country in this second category share the difficulty of have many of the structure of a modern political and social_system without the modern standard of performance require to make them effective . 
in these rapidly changing society there be also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goal . 
the colonial period has generally leave people believe that government can , if it wish , provide all manner of service for them - and that with independence freeman do not have_to work to realize the benefit of modern life . 
for_example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most transitional society have announce economic development plan of vary number of year ; such be the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement . 
the civil_service in such society be generally inadequate to deal competently with the problem face them ; and their member often equate a government career with security and status rather_than with sacrifice , self-discipline , and competence . 
american policy should press constantly the view that until these government demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracy there be not the slight hope that they will either modernize of democratize their society . 
we should spread the view that planning and national development be serious matter which call_for effort as_well_as enthusiasm . 
above_all , we should seek to encourage the leader of these society to accept the unpleasant fact that they be responsible_for their fate . 
only within the framework of a mature relationship characterize by honest appraisal of performance can we provide telling assistance . 
with_respect_to those country whose leader prefer to live with their illusion , we can afford to wait , for in_time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all to see . 
our technical assistance to these country should place special emphasis on induce the central government to assume the role of advisor and guide which at an earlier stage foreign expert assume in deal with the central government . 
we should encourage the government to develop their own technical assistance to community , state and provincial government , rural community , and other smaller group , make certain that no important segment of the economy is neglect . 
simultaneously we should be underline the interrelationship of technical progress in various field , show how agricultural training can be introduce into education , how health affect labor productivity , how small business can benefit the rural farm community , and , above_all , how progress in each field relate to national progress . 
effort such_as the group in the location have demonstrate that transitional society can work toward balanced national development . 
to achieve this goal of balanced development , communication between the central government and the local community must be such_that the need and aspiration of the people themselves are effectively take_into_account . 
if modernization program are impose from above , without the understanding and cooperation of the people , they will encounter grave difficulty . 
land_reform be likely to be a pressing issue in many of these country . 
it should be american policy not_only to encourage effective land_reform program but also to underline the relation of such reform to the economic growth and modernization of the society . 
as an isolated policy , land_reform be likely to be politically disruptive ; as part of a large development effort , however , it may gain wide acceptance . 
it should also be recognize that the problem of rural tenancy cannot be solve by administrative decree alone . 
land_reform program need to be supplement with program for promote rural credit and technical assistance in agriculture . 
lastly , governmental and private planner will at this stage begin to see large capital requirement loom ahead . 
by hold_out prospect for external capital assistance , the united_states can provide strong incentive to prepare_for the concerted economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth . 
at a third stage in the modernization process be such country as india , brazil , the philippines , and taiwan , which be ready and commit to move_into the stage of self-sustaining growth . 
they must continue to satisfy basic capital need ; and there persist the dual problem of maintain operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralize participation in the program to wide and wide group . 
but these country have make big stride toward develop the necessary human and social overhead capital ; they have establish reasonably stable and effective governmental institution at national and local level ; and they have begin to develop a capacity to deal realistically and simultaneously with all the major sector of their economy . 
on the economic front , the first priority of these country be to mobilize a vastly increased volume of resource . 
several related task must be carry_out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieve . 
these country must formulate a comprehensive , long-term program cover the objective of both the private and the public sector of the economy . 
they must in their planning be able to count_on at_least tentative commitment of foreign capital assistance over period of several year . 
capital import draw from a number of source must be employ and combine skillfully enough to permit domestic investment programming to go_forward . 
capital flow must be coordinate with national need and planning . 
finally , a balance must be effect among project finance , utilization of agricultural surplus , and general balance_of_payments support . 
thus , although the agenda of external assistance in the economic sphere be cumulative , and many_of the policy suggest for nation in the early stage remain relevant , the basic purpose of american economic_policy during the later stage of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining growth is not prevent by lack of foreign_exchange . 
there remain many political and administrative problem to be solve . 
for_one_thing , although considerable number of men have been train , bureaucracy be still deficient in many respect ; even the famed group be not fully adequate_to the tremendous range of task it has undertake . 
technical assistance in train middle-level - and upper-level management_personnel is still need in many case . 
there be also more basic problem . 
this be the stage at which democratic development must take_place if the society is to become an open community of creative people . 
nevertheless , impulse still exist among the ruling elite to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need for centralized and authoritarian practice . 
another great danger be that the emerge middle_class will feel itself increasingly alienate from the political_leader who still justify their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism . 
the capacity of intellectual and member of the new professional class to contribute creatively to national development be likely to be destroy by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their own political class and their colleague and professional counterpart in the west . 
particularly when base upon a single dominant party , government may respond to such a situation by claim a monopoly of understanding about the national interest . 
convinced of the wisdom of their own action , and reassure by the promise of their economic development program , government may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort , become instead rigid and inflexible in their policy . 
american policy toward such society should stress our sympathy for the emerge social and professional class . 
it should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standard and an understanding of the tremendous power and potentiality of genuinely open and pluralistic society . 
we have every obligation to take seriously their claim to be democratic and free country ; we also have , in consequence , the duty to appraise realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate our judgment to their leader in frank but friendly way . 
we have emphasize that the modernizing process in each society will take a considerable period_of_time . 
with the exception of treaty make , foreign relation were historically concern for_the_most_part with condition of short or at_least measurable duration . 
foreign_policy now take_on a different perspective and must become skilled not merely at response but also at projection . 
american and free_world policy can marginally affect the pace of transition ; but basically that pace depend_on change in the supply of resource and in the human attitude , political institution , and social_structure which each society must generate . 
it follow that any effective policy toward the underdeveloped country must have a realistically long working horizon . 
it must be mark by a patience and persistence which have not always be its trademark . 
this condition affect not_only the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign_policy , especially in the context of economic aid . 
the place of religion in the simple , preliterate society be quite definite ; as a complex it fit into the whole social_organization and function dominantly in every part of_it . 
in society like ours , however , its place be less clear and more complex . 
with the diversity of religious viewpoint , there be difference_of_opinion as to the essential feature of religion ; and there be different opinion as to the essential function of religion . 
nevertheless , for most_of the population of heterogeneous advanced society , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social function . 
although the inner function of religion be not of direct significance in social_organization , they have important indirect consequence . 
if the inner function of religion are perform , the individual be a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; he be not greatly frustrated , and he be not anomic ; he be better fit to perform his social life among his fellow . 
there be several closely related inner function . 
in_the_last_analysis , religion be the means of induce , formulate , express , enhance , implement , and perpetuate man 's deep experience - the religious . 
man be first religious ; the instrumentality follow . 
religion seek to satisfy human need of great pertinence . 
the significant thing in it , at the higher religious level , be the inner emotional , mental , and spiritual occurrence that fill the pressing human need of self-preservation , self pacification , and self completion . 
the chief experience be the sensing of communion , and in the higher religion , of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural power . 
related_to this be the fact that most_of the higher religion define for the individual his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he be relatively secure in an ordered , dependable universe . 
man have the experience of being helpfully ally_with what he cannot fully understand ; he be a coordinate part of all_of the mysterious energy and being and movement . 
the universe be a safe and permanent home . 
a number of religion also satisfy for many the need of being link with the ultimate and eternal . 
death be not permanent defeat and disappearance ; man have a second chance . 
he be not lost in the abyss of endless time ; he have endless being . 
religion at its best also offer the experience of spiritual fulfillment by invite man into the highest realm of the spirit . 
religion can summate , epitomize , relate , and conserve all the highest ideal and values - ethical , aesthetic , and religious - of man form in his culture . 
there be also the possibility , among higher religion , of experience consistent meaning in life and enjoy guidance and expansiveness . 
the kind of religious experience that most modern seek not_only provide , clarify , and relate human yearning , values , ideal , and purpose ; it also provide facility and incitement for the development of personality , sociality , and creativeness . 
under the religious impulse , whether theistic or humanistic , man have joy in live ; life lead somewhere . 
religion at its best be out in_front , ever beckon and lead_on , and , as person put it , `` mobilize all man 's scattered energy in one triumphant sense of his own infinite importance '' . 
at_the_same_time that religion bind the individual helpfully to the supernatural and give him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment , it also have great therapeutic value for him . 
it give him aid , comfort , even solace , in meet mundane life situation where his own unassisted practical knowledge and skill are feel by him to be inadequate . 
he be confront with the recurrent crisis , such_as great natural catastrophe and the great transition of life - marriage , incurable disease , widowhood , old_age , the certainty of death . 
he has_to cope_with frustration and other emotional_disturbance and anomie . 
his religious_belief provide him with plausible explanation for many condition which cause him great concern , and his religious faith make possible fortitude , equanimity , and consolation , enable him to endure colossal misfortune , fear , frustration , uncertainty , suffering , evil , and danger . 
religion usually also include a principle of compensation , mainly in a promised perfect future state . 
the belief in immortality , where hold , function as a redress for the ill and disappointment of the here_and_now . 
the tension accompany a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing or sinning or some torment secret are relieve for the less self-contained or self-sufficient by confession , repentance , and penance . 
the feeling of individual inferiority , defeat , or humiliation grow out of various social situation or individual deficiency or failure is compensate for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly , but all-victorious father-god , as_well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith , and by opportunity in religious act for give_vent to emotion and energy . 
in provide for these inner individual function , religion undertake in behalf of individual peace_of_mind and well-being service for which there be no other institution . 
in_addition to the function of religion within man , there have always be the outer social function for the community and society . 
the two have never be separable . 
religion be vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and regulation . 
the value-system of a community or society is always correlated with , and to a degree dependent upon , a more_or_less shared system of religious_belief and conviction . 
the religion support , reinforce , reaffirm , and maintain the fundamental values . 
even in the united_states , with its freedom of religious_belief and worship and its vast denominational differentiation , there be a general consensus regard the basic christian values . 
this is demonstrate especially when there be awareness of radically different value_orientation elsewhere ; for_example person rally to christian values vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism . 
in america also all_of our major religious body officially sanction a universalistic ethic which be reflective of our common religion . 
even the non church_member - the freewheeler , marginal religionist and_so_on - have the values of christian civilization internalize in them . 
furthermore , religion tend to integrate the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of god to the intermediary and subordinate values ; for_example , those regard material object and pragmatic end . 
finally , it give sanctity , more than human legitimacy , and even , through super empirical reference , transcendent and supernatural importance to some values ; for_example , marriage as a sacrament , much law-breaking as sinful , occasionally the state as a divine instrument . 
it place certain values at_least beyond questioning and tampering . 
closely related to this function be the fact that the religious system provide a body of ultimate end for the society , which be compatible with the supreme eternal end . 
this something lead to a conception of an overall social plan with a meaning interpretable in_terms_of ultimate end ; for_example , a plan that fulfill the will of god , which advance the kingdom_of_god , which involve social life as part of the grand design . 
this explain some group end and provide a justification of their primacy . 
it give social guidance and direction and make_for program of social action . 
finally , it give meaning to much social endeavor , and logic , consistency , and meaning to life . 
in_general , there be no society so secularized as to be completely without religiously inspire transcendental end . 
religion integrate and unify . 
some of the oldest , most persistent , and most cohesive form of social grouping have grow out of religion . 
these group have vary widely from mere family , primitive , totemic group , and small modern cult and sect , to the membership of great denomination , and great , widely dispersed world religion . 
religion foster group life in various way . 
the common ultimate values , end and goal foster by religion be a most important factor . 
without a system of value-system there can be no society . 
where such a value-system prevail , it always unify all who possess it ; it enable member of the society to operate as a system . 
the belief of a religion also reflect the values are express in creed , dogma , and doctrine , and form what person call a credo . 
as he point_out , a religious group cannot exist without a collective credo , and the more extensive the credo , the more unified and strong be the group . 
the credo unify and socialize man by attach them completely to an identical body of doctrine ; the more extensive and firm the body of doctrine , the firm the group . 
the religious symbolism , and especially the closely related rite and worship form , constitute a powerful bond for the member of the particular faith . 
the religion , in_fact , be an expression of the unity of the group , small or large . 
the common code , for religious action as_such and in their ethical aspect for everyday moral behavior , bind the devotee together . 
these be way of jointly participate in significantly symbolize , standardized , and ordered religiously sanctified behavior . 
the code be mechanism for training in , and direct and enforce , uniform social interaction , and for continually and publicly reassert the solidarity of the group . 
person note long_ago that religion as `` a unified system of belief and practice relative to sacred thing - unite [ s ] into one single moral community - all those who adhere to them '' . 
his view be that every religion pertain to a community , and , conversely , every community be in one aspect a religious unit . 
this is bring_out in the common religious ethos that prevail even in the denominationally diverse audience at many secular semipublic and public occasion in the united_states ; and it is evidence in the prayer offer , in the frequent religious allusion , and in the confirmation of point on religious grounds . 
the unify effect of religion is also bring_out in the fact that historically people have cling together as more_or_less cohesive cultural unit , with religion as the dominant bond , even though spatially dispersed and not politically organized . 
the person for 2500 year have be a prime example , though the adherent of any world or inter people religion be case_in_point . 
it might be point_out that the integrating function of religion , for good or ill , has often support or been identify with other grouping - political , nationality , language , class , racial , sociability , even economic . 
religion usually exercise a stabilizing conserving function . 
as_such it act_as an anchor for the people . 
there be a marked tendency for religion , once firmly establish , to resist change , not_only in their own doctrine and policy and practice , but also in secular affairs have religious relevance . 
it has thus be a significant factor in the conservation of social values , though also in some measure , an obstacle to the creation or diffusion of new ones . 
it tend to support the longstanding precious sentiment , the traditional way of thinking , and the customary way of live . 
as person has point_out , the `` reliance on symbol , on tradition , on sacred_writing , on the cultivation of emotional feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values , turn one to the past far more than to the future '' . 
historically , religion has also function as a tremendous engine of vindication , enforcement , sanction , and perpetuation of various other institution . 
at_the_same_time that religion exercise a conserving influence , it also energize and motivate both individual and group . 
much of the important individual and social action has been owe to religious incentive . 
the great ultimate end of religion have serve as magnificent beacon_light that lure people toward them with an almost irresistible force , mobilize energy and induce sacrifice ; for_example , the crusade , mission effort , just war . 
much effort has been expend in the sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonition of religion . 
the insuperable reward system that most religion embody have great motivating effect . 
religion provide the most attractive reward , either in this world or the next , for those who not merely abide_by its norm , but who engage in good works . 
religion usually act_as a powerful aid in social_control , enforce what man should or should not do . 
among primitive people the sanction and dictate of religion be more binding than any of the other control exercise by the group ; and in modern society such influence be still great . 
religion have its own supernatural prescription that be at_the_same_time code_of_behavior for the here_and_now . 
an analysis of the election fall naturally in four part . 
first be the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion . 
preparation begin slightly more than a year after independence with the first_step to organize rural commune . 
all political interest support electoral planning , although there be some sign that the inherent uncertainty of a popular judgment lead to some procrastination . 
the second major aspect of the election be the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting . 
considerable technical skill was use and the administration of the election be generally above reproach . 
however , the regionally differentiated result , which appear below in table , be interesting evidence of the problem of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstance . 
a third aspect , and probably the one open_to most controversy , be the result of the election . 
the electoral procedure prevent the ready identification of party affiliation , but all vitally interested party , include the government itself , were busily engage in determine the party identification of all successful candidate the month following the election . 
the fourth and concluding point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the election and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics . 
election have figure prominently in nearly every government program and official address since independence . 
they were stress in the speech of person when the first group was form and again when the istiqlal take a leading role in the second group . 
person /5 , was know to be most sympathetic to the formation of local self-government and make the first firm promise of election on may_day , 1957 . 
there follow a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of election for the fall of 1957 , in which it appear that the person take the most pessimistic view and that the istiqlal be something less_than enthusiastic . 
since the complicated process of establish new commune and review the rudimentary plan leave by the_french did not even begin until the fall of 1957 , this goal appear somewhat ambitious . 
from the very beginning the electoral discussion raise fundamental issue in moroccan politics , precisely the type of question that be most difficult to resolve in the new government . 
until the charter_of_liberties was issue in the fall of 1958 , there be no guarantee of the right to assemble or to organize for political purpose . 
the istiqlal be still firmly united in 1957 , but the group ( group ) , the most important minor party at the time , object to the istiqlal 's predominance in the civil_service and influence in radio_maroc . 
there be rumor that the group favor an arbitrary , `` nonpolitical '' process , which were indirectly affirm when the king personally intervene in the planned meeting . 
the day following his intervention the palace issue a statement reassure the citizen that `` the possibility of introduce appeal concern the establishment of electoral list , list of candidate and finally the holding of the consultation itself '' would be support by the king himself . 
the ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postpone further consideration of election , but french consultant were call_in and notice of further investigation appear from_time_to_time . 
in january , 1958 , the person announce that an election law be ready to be submit to the king , the rumor of election date appear once_again , first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer . 
although the government be probably prepared for election by mid - 1958 , the first decision was no_doubt make more difficult as party strife multiply . 
in late 1957 the m.p. ( mouvement_populaire ) appear and in the spring of 1958 the internal strain of the istiqlal was reveal when the third group under person was form without support from progressive element in the party . 
the party be on_the_whole unprepared for election , while the people were still experience post independence letdown and suffer the aftereffect of poor harvest in 1957 . 
despite the internal and international crisis that harass morocco the election remain a central issue . 
they figure prominently in the person government of may , 1958 , which the king be reportedly determined to keep in office until election could be hold . 
but the eagerly seek `` homogeneity '' of the location group was never achieve as the istiqlal quarrel over foreign_policy , labor politics and economic development . 
by december , 1958 , when ' person become person , election have even greater importance . 
they were increasingly look_upon as a means of establish the new rural commune as the focus of a new , constructive national effort . 
to minimize the chance of repeat the person debacle the person government was form a titre personnel and a special office was create in the group to plan and to conduct the election . 
by this time there be little doubt but what election plan be complete . 
there remain only the delicate task of maneuver the law through the labyrinth of palace politics and make a small number of policy decision . 
from the rather tortuous history of electoral planning in morocco an important point emerge concern the first election in a developing country and evaluate their result . 
in the new country the electoral process is consider as a means of resolve fundamental , and sometimes bitter , difference among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance . 
in the absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organized political group hope that the election will give them new prominence , but in a system where there be as_yet no place for the less prominent . 
lack the respected and effective institution that consensus help provide , minority party , such_as the p.d.i. in 1957 and the progressive istiqlal faction in 1958 , clamor for election when out of power , but be not at_all certain they wish_to be control by popular choice when in power . 
those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process . 
the tendency to treat election as an instrument of self-interest rather_than an instrument of national interest have two important effect on electoral planning in morocco . 
at the central level the scrutin_uninominal_voting_system was select over some form of the scrutin_de_liste_system , even though the latter had been recommend by person and favor by all political_party . 
the choice of the single member district was dictate to a certain extent by problem of communication and understanding in the more remote area of the country , but it also serve to minimize the national political value of the election . 
although the election be for local official , it be not necessary to conduct the election so as to prevent party from publicly identify their candidate . 
with multiple member district the still fragmentary local party organization could have operate more effectively and party might have been encourage to state their position more clearly . 
both party and the group be busily at_work after the election try to unearth the political affiliation of the successful candidate and , thereby , give the election a confidential but known degree of national political significance . 
since a national interpretation cannot be avoid it be unfortunate that the election were not hold in a way to maximize party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation . 
the general setting of the moroccan election may also encourage the deterioration of local party organization . 
the concentration of effective power in rabat lead not_only to party bickering , but to distraction from local activity that might have have many auxiliary benefit in_addition to contribute to more meaningful election . 
interesting evidence can be find in the result of the chamber_of_commerce election , which take_place three week before national election . 
the istiqlal sponsor group ( group , group ) was oppose by candidate of the new group ( group ) in nearly all urban_center . 
as the more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy businessmen , the group was generally favor against the more progressive , labor based group the new party campaign heavily , while the old , more confident party expect the moroccan merchant and small_businessman to support them as they had do for many year . 
the local istiqlal and group office did not campaign and lose heavily . 
the value of the election was lost , both as an experiment in increased political participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest , as show in table /1 , . 
the group election be , of_course , an important event in the preparation for rural commune election . 
the group learn that its urban organization , which depend_on heavily on group support , be most effective . 
the istiqlal find that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle was not easily transpose to the more concrete , precise problem of internal politics . 
the overall effect be probably to stimulate more party activity in the communal election than might have otherwise take_place . 
a second major point of this essay be to examine the formal arrangement for the election . 
although a somewhat technical subject , it have important political implication as the above discussion of the voting_system indicate . 
furthermore , the problem and solution devise in the electoral experience of the rapidly changing country be often of comparative value and essential to evaluate election result . 
the sine_qua_non of the election be naturally an impartial and standardized procedure . 
as the background discussion indicate there be frequently expressed doubt that a government dominated_by either party could fairly administer election . 
the p.d.i. and later the popular_movement protect the istiqlal 's `` privileged position '' until the fall of person , and_then the istiqlal use the same argument , which it had previously ignore , against the pro group tendency of the person government . 
the bulk of the preparation had , of_course , proceed under the supervision of the group , whose official are bar from party activity and probably generally disinterested in party politics . 
apart from some area of recur trouble , like location , where inexperienced official had been appoint , there be little evidence that local official intervene in the electoral process . 
centrally , however , the administrative problem be more complex and the sheer prestige of office be very likely an unfair advantage . 
the king decide to remove person a week before election and to institute a nonparty group under his personal direction . 
although the monarch had frequently assert that the election were to be without party significance , his action be an implicit admission that party identification be a factor . 
the new council be itself inescapably of political meaning , which was most clearly reveal in the absence of any group member and the presence of several istiqlal leaders . 
since the detail of the election were settle the change of government have no direct effect on the technical aspect of the election , and may have been more important as an indication of royal displeasure with the u.n.f.p. 
voting preparation begin in the fall of 1959 , although the actual demarcation and planning for the rural commune was complete in 1958 . 
there be three major administrative task : the fixing of electoral district , the registration of voter and the registration of candidate . 
voter registration begin in late november 1959 and continue until early january , 1960 . 
the government be most anxious that there be a respectable response . 
periodic bulletin of the accomplishment in each province make the registration process into a kind of competition among provincial official . 
a goal was fix , as give in table 2 , and attention focus_on its fulfillment . 
the qualification to vote were keep very simple . 
both man and woman of twenty-one years of_age could register and vote upon present proof of residence and identification . 
there be liberal provision for dispensation where document or record be lacking . 
the police be disqualified along with certain category of naturalized citizen , criminal and those punish for protectorate activity . 
the registration figure give in table 2 must be interpret with caution since the estimate for eligible elector were make without the benefit of a reliable census . 
but neither be the statement empirical , for goodness be not a quality like red or squeaky that could be see or hear . 
what were they to do , then , with these awkward judgment of value ? 
to find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the theory radically , and yet that theory be what they regard_as their most important discovery . 
it appear that the theory could be save in one way only . 
if it could be show that judgment of good and bad be not judgment at_all , that they assert nothing true or false , but merely express emotion like `` hurrah '' or `` fiddlesticks '' , then these wayward judgment would cease from trouble and weary head could be at_rest . 
this be the course the positivist take . 
they explain value judgment by explain them away . 
now i do not think their view will do . 
but before discuss it , i should_like to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they have state their case . 
it has been say of person that he write so clearly that he could be find_out . 
this theory has been put so clearly and precisely that it deserve criticism of the same kind , and this i will do my best to supply . 
the theory claim to show by analysis that when we say , `` that be good '' , we do not mean to assert a character of the subject of which we are think . 
i shall argue that we do mean to do just that . 
let us work_through an example , and the simple and common the better . 
there is perhaps no value_statement on which people would more universally agree than the statement that intense pain be bad . 
let us take a set of circumstance in which i happen to be interested on the legislative side and in which i think every one of us might naturally make such a statement . 
we come_upon a rabbit that has been catch in one of the brutal trap in common use . 
there be sign that it has struggle for day to escape and that in a frenzy of hunger , pain , and fear , it has all_but eat off its own leg . 
the attempt fail : the animal be now dead . 
as we think_of the long and excruciating pain it must have suffer , we be very likely to say : `` it be a bad thing that the little animal should suffer so '' . 
the positivist tell us that when we say this we are only express our present emotion . 
i hold , on_the_contrary , that we mean to assert something of the pain itself , namely , that it be bad - bad when and as it occur . 
consider what follow from the positivist view . 
on that view , nothing good or bad happen in the case until i come_on the scene and make my remark . 
for what i express in my remark be something go_on in me at the time , and that of_course did not exist until i did come_on the scene . 
the pain of the rabbit be not itself bad ; nothing evil was happen when that pain was being endure ; badness , in the only sense in which it is involve at_all , wait for its appearance till i come and look and feel . 
now that this be at_odds with our meaning may be show as_follows . 
let us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come_on the scene and that the rabbit never was discover . 
be we prepared to say that in that case nothing bad occur in the sense in which we say it did ? 
clearly not . 
indeed we should say , on_the_contrary , that the accident of our later discovery make no difference whatever to the badness of the animal 's pain , that it would have be every whit as bad whether a chance passerby happen later to discover the body and feel repugnance or not . 
if so , then it be clear that in say the suffering be bad we are not express our feeling only . 
we are say that the pain be bad when and as it occur and before anyone take an attitude toward it . 
the first argument be thus an ideal experiment in which we use the method of difference . 
it remove our present expression and show that the badness we mean would not be affect by this , whereas on positivist ground it should be . 
the second argument apply the method in the reverse way . 
it ideally remove the past event , and show that this would render false what we mean to say , whereas on positivist ground it should not . 
let us suppose that the animal did not in_fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at_all , but that we mistakenly believe it did , and say as before that its suffering be an evil thing . 
on the positivist theory , everything i seek to express by call it evil in the first case be still present in the second . 
in the only sense in which badness is involve at_all , whatever be bad in the first case be still present in its entirety , since all that is express in either case be a state of feeling , and that feeling be still there . 
and our question be , be such an implication consistent with what we mean ? 
clearly it be not . 
if anyone ask us , after we make the remark that the suffering be a bad thing , whether we should think it relevant to what we say to learn that the incident had never occur and no pain had been suffer at_all , we should say that it make all the difference in_the_world , that what we were assert to be bad be precisely the suffering we think had occur back there , that if this had not occur , there be nothing leave to be bad , and that our assertion be in that case mistaken . 
the suggestion that in say something evil had occur we were after_all make no mistake , because we had never mean anyhow to say anything about the past suffering , seem to me merely frivolous . 
if we did not mean to say this , why should we be so relieve on find that the suffering had not occur ? 
on the theory before us , such relief would be groundless , for in that suffering itself there be nothing bad at_all , and hence in its nonoccurrence there would be nothing to be relieve about . 
the positivist theory would here distort our meaning beyond recognition . 
so_far_as i can see , there is only one way_out for the positivist . 
he hold that goodness and badness lie_in feeling of approval or disapproval . 
and there is a way in which he might hold that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval without belong_to the pain itself . 
the pain in itself be neutral ; but unfortunately the rabbit , on no ground at_all , take_up toward this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that make it for_the_first_time , and in the only intelligible sense , bad . 
this way of escape be theoretically possible , but since it have grave difficulty of its own and has not , so_far_as i know , be urge by positivist , it be perhaps best not to spend time over it . 
i come now to a third argument , which again be very simple . 
when we come_upon the rabbit and make our remark about its suffering be a bad thing , we presumably make it with some feeling ; the positivist be plainly right in say that such remark do usually express feeling . 
but suppose that a week later we revert to the incident in thought and make our statement again . 
and suppose that the circumstance have now so change that the feeling with which we make the remark in_the_first_place has fade . 
the pathetic evidence be no_longer before us ; and we be now so fatigued in body and mind that feeling be , as_we_say , quite dead . 
in these circumstance , since what was express by the remark when first make be , on the theory before us , simply absent , the remark now express nothing . 
it be as empty as the word `` hurrah '' would be when there be no enthusiasm behind it . 
and this seem to me untrue . 
when we repeat the remark that such suffering be a bad thing , the feeling with which we make it last week may be at or near the vanishing_point , but if we were ask whether we mean to say what we did before , we should certainly answer yes . 
we should say that we make our point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time , but that it be the same point we were make . 
and if we can see that what we mean to say remain the same , while the feeling vary from intensity to near zero , it be not the feeling that we primarily mean to express . 
i come now to a fourth consideration . 
we all believe that toward act or effect of a certain kind one attitude be fitting and another not ; but on the theory before us such a belief would not make_sense . 
person and person have lately contend that this fitness be one of the main fact of ethics , and i suspect they be right . 
but that be not exactly my point . 
my point be this : 
whether there is such fitness or not , we all assume that there is , and if we do , we express in moral judgment more than the subjectivist say we do . 
let me illustrate . 
in his novel the_house_of_the_dead , person tell of his experience in a location prison_camp . 
whatever the unhappy inmate of such camp be like today , person 's companion be about as grim a lot as can be imagine . 
`` i have hear story '' , he write , `` of the most terrible , the most unnatural action , of the most monstrous murder , tell with the most spontaneous , childishly merry laughter '' . 
most of us would say that in this delight at the killing of others or the cause of suffering there is something very unfitting . 
if we were ask why we think so , we should say that these thing involve great evil and be wrong , and that to take delight in what be evil or wrong be plainly unfitting . 
now on the subjectivist view , this answer is rule_out . 
for before someone take_up an attitude toward death , suffering , or their infliction , they have no moral quality at_all . 
there is therefore nothing about them to which an attitude of approval or condemnation could be fitting . 
they be in themselves neutral , and , so_far_as they get a moral quality , they get it only through being invest with it by the attitude of the onlooker . 
but if that is true , why be any attitude more fitting than any other ? 
would applause , for_example , be fitting if , apart from the applause , there be nothing good to applaud ? 
would condemnation be fitting if , independently of the condemnation , there be nothing bad to condemn ? 
in such a case , any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting as any other , which mean that the notion of fitness has lose all point . 
indeed we are force to go much farther . 
if goodness and badness lie_in attitude only and hence are bring into being by them , those man who greet death and misery with childishly merry laughter are take the only sensible line . 
if there is nothing evil in these thing , if they get their moral complexion only from our feeling about them , why should n't they be greet with a cheer ? 
to greet them with repulsion would turn_into what before be neutral into something bad ; it would needlessly bring badness into the world ; and even on subjectivist assumption that does not seem very bright . 
on_the_other_hand , to greet them with delight would convert what before be neutral into something good ; it would bring goodness into the world . 
the injured german veteran be a former miner , twenty-four year old , who had been wound by shrapnel in the back of the head . 
this result in damage to the occipital_lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also . 
in_any_event , the extraordinary result of this injury be that he become `` psychically blind '' , while at_the_same_time , apparently , the sense_of_touch remain essentially intact . 
psychical blindness be a condition in which there be a total absence of visual memory_image , a condition in which , for_example , one be unable to remember something just see or to conjure_up a memory_picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence . 
this circumstance in the patient 's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remain basically in sound working order constitute its exceptional value for the problem at_hand since the evidence present by the author be overwhelming that , when the patient close his eye , he have absolutely no spatial ( that_is , third-dimensional ) awareness whatsoever . 
the necessary inference , as the author themselves interpret it , would seem to be this : `` ( 1 ) spatial quality be not among those grasp by the sense_of_touch , as_such . 
we do not arrive_at spatial image by means of the sense_of_touch by itself . 
( 2 ) spatiality become part of the tactual_sensation only by way of visual representation ; that_is , there be , in the true sense , only a visual_space '' . 
the underlying assumption , of_course , be that only sight and touch enable us , in any precise and fully dependable way , to locate object in space beyond us , the other sense be decidedly inferior , if_not totally inadequate , in this regard . 
this be an assumption with which few would be dispose to quarrel . 
therefore , if the sense_of_touch is function normally and there be a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically blind person when the eye are close and an object is handle , the conclusion seem unavoidable that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality of thing and that actual sight or visual representation be necessary . 
the force of the author ' analysis ( if indeed it have any force ) can be feel by the reader , i believe , only after three question have been successfully answer . 
( 1 ) what allow us to think that the patient have no third-dimensional representation when his eye were close ? 
( 2 ) what evidence is there that he be psychically blind ? 
( 3 ) how can we be sure that his sense_of_touch was not profoundly disturb by his head injury ? 
we shall consider these in the inverse order of their presentation . 
obviously , a satisfactory answer to the third question be imperative , if the argument is to get underway at_all , for if there be any possibility of doubt whether the patient 's tactual sensitivity had been impair by the occipital lesion , any finding whatsoever in regard_to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail altogether , of_course , as evidence to establish the desired conclusion . 
the answer the author give to it , therefore , be of supreme importance . 
it be as_follows : `` the usual sensitivity test show that the specific quality of skin_perceptiveness ( pressure , pain , temperature ) , as_well_as the kinesthetic sensation ( muscular feeling , feeling in the tendon and joint ) , be , as_such , essentially intact , although they seem , in_comparison_with normal reaction , to be somewhat diminished over the entire body . 
the supposed tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient and his ability to specify the location of a member , as_well_as the direction and scope of a movement , passively execute ( with one of his member ) , prove to have been , on_the_contrary , very considerably affect '' . 
the author insist , however , that these abnormality in the sense_of_touch be due_to absolutely to no organic disorder in that sense faculty but rather to the injury which the patient had sustain to the sense of sight . 
first_of_all , what be their evidence that the tactual apparatus be fundamentally undamaged ? 
( 1 ) when an object was place in the patient 's hand , he have no difficulty determine whether it be warm or cold , sharp or blunt , rough or smooth , flexible , soft , or hard ; and he could tell , simply by the feel of it , whether it be made of wood , iron , cloth , rubber , and_so_on . 
and he could recognize , by touch alone , article which he had handle immediately before , even though they be altogether unfamiliar to him and could not be identify by him ; that_is , he be unaware what kind of object they be or what their use be . 
( 2 ) the patient attain an astonishing efficiency in a new trade . 
because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffer to his sight , the patient had to train himself for a new line_of_work , that of a portfolio maker , an occupation require a great_deal of precision in the make of measurement and a fairly well developed sense of form and contour . 
it seem clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient ( we shall describe it in_detail in_connection_with our second question , the one concern the psychical blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely_on his sense_of_touch much more_than the usual portfolio maker and that consequently that faculty be most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision . 
and so the author conclude : `` the conduct of the patient in his everyday life and in his work , even more_than the foregoing fact [ mention above under 1 ] , leave positively no room for doubt that the sense_of_touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , be unaffected ; or , to put the same thing in physiological term , that the performance capacity of the tactual apparatus , from the periphery up to the tactual center in the brain , - that_is , from one end to the other - be unimpaired '' . 
if the argument is accept as essentially sound up to this point , it remain for us to consider whether the patient 's difficulty in orient himself spatially and in locate object in space with the sense_of_touch can be explain by his defective visual condition . 
but before we can do this , we must first find answer to our original question 1 and 2 ; then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at_hand . 
in what way , then , did the patient 's psychical blindness manifest itself ? 
he could not see object as unified , self-contained , and organized figure , as a person does with normal vision . 
the meaning of_this , as we shall see , be that he have no fund of visual memory_image of object as object ; and , therefore , he could not recognize even long-familiar thing upon see them again . 
instead , he constantly become lost in part and component of them , confuse some of their detail with those of neighboring object , and_so_on , unless he allow time to `` trace '' the object in_question through minute movement of the head and hand and in this way to discover its contour . 
according_to his own testimony , he never actually see thing as shaped but only as generally amorphous `` blot '' of color of a more_or_less indefinite size ; at their edge they slip pretty_much out_of_focus altogether . 
but by the tracing procedure , he could , in a strange obviously kinesthetic manner , find the unseen form ; could piece , as_it_were , the jumbled mass together into an organized whole and_then recognize it as a man or a triangle or whatever it turn_out to be . 
if , however , the figure to be discern be complicated , compose of several interlocking subfigure , and_so_on , even the tracing process fail him , and he could not focus even relatively simple shape among its part . 
this mean , concretely , that the patient could not read at_all without make writing like movement of the head or body , become easily confuse by `` hash_mark '' insert between handwritten word and thus confuse the mark for one of the letter , and could recognize a simple straight_line or a curved one only by trace it . 
the patient himself deny that he have any visual imagery at_all ; and there be ample evidence of the following sort to corroborate him . 
after a conversation with another man , he be able to recount practically everything that had been say but could not describe at_all what the other man look_like . 
nor could he call_up memory_picture of close friend or relative . 
in_short , both his own declaration and his figural_blindness , when he look at object , seem to present undeniable evidence that he have simply no visual memory at_all . 
he be oblivious of the form of the object actually being view , precisely because he could not assign it to a visual shape , already learn and hold in visual memory , as person of normal vision do . 
he could not recognize it ; he be absolutely unfamiliar with it because he have no visual memory at_all . 
therefore , his only recourse be to learn the shape all_over again for each new visual experience of the same individual object or type of object ; and this he could do only by go_over its mass with the tracing procedure . 
then he might finally recognize it , apparently by combine the visual blot , actually being see , with tactual feeling in_the_head or body accompany the tracing movement . 
this would mean , it can readily be see , that , again , for each new visual experience the tracing motion would have_to be repeat because of the absence of visual imagery . 
as one would surmise , the procedure , however , could be repeat with the same object or with the same type of object often enough , so that the corresponding visual blot and the mere beginning of the tracing movement would provide clue as_to the actual shape , which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of inference . 
man , tree , automobile , house , and_so_on - object continually confront in everyday life - have each its characteristic blot appearance and become easily recognizable , at the very beginning of tracing , by an inference as_to what each be . 
dice , for_example , he infer from black dot on a white surface . 
he evidently could not actually see the corner of these object , but their size and the dot give_away them away . 
and the author give numerous instance of calculated guessing on the patient 's part to show how large a role it play in his process of readapt himself and how proficient he become at it . 
often he seem even to have be able to guess correctly , without the tracing motion , solely on the basis of qualitative difference among the blot like thing which appear in his visual experience . 
perhaps the very important question - what be , then , exactly the role of kinesthetic sensation in the patient 's ability to recognize form and shape by means of the tracing movement when he is actually look at thing ? 
- has now been raise in the reader 's mind and in the following form . 
if the patient can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually , then , it would seem , the sense_of_touch have immediate contact with the spatial aspect of thing in_independence_of visual representation , at_least in regard_to two dimension , and , as we shall see , even this much spatial awareness on_the_part_of unaided touch is deny by the author . 
how , then , do the kinesthetic sensation function in all this ? 
the author set_about answer this fundamental question through a detailed investigation of the patient 's ability , tactually , ( 1 ) to perceive figure and ( 2 ) to locate object in space , with his eye close ( or turn_away from the object concerned ) . 
quite naturally , they make the investigation , first , by prohibit the patient from make any movement at_all and_then , later , by repeat it and allow the patient to move in any way he want to . 
when the patient was not allow to move his body in any way at_all , the following striking result occur . 
whenever artist , indeed , turn_to actual representation or mold three-dimensional_figure , which be rare down to 800 bc , they tend to reflect reality ( see plate 6a , 9b ) ; a schematic , abstract treatment of man and animal , by intent , rise only in the late eighth century . 
to speak of this underlying view of the world be to embark upon matter of subjective judgment . 
at_the_least , however , one may conclude that geometric potter sense a logical order ; their principle of composition stand very close to those which appear in the homeric epic and the hexameter line . 
their world , again , be a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly begin to appreciate the complexity of life . 
and perhaps an observer of the vase will not go_too_far in deduce that the outlook of their maker and user be basically stable and secure . 
the storm of the past had die_away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not_yet begin to disturb man 's mind . 
throughout the work of the late ninth century a calm , severe serenity display itself . 
in the vase this spirit may perhaps at_times bore or repel one in its internal self-satisfaction , but the best of the geometric pin have rightly been consider among the most beautiful ever make in the greek world . 
the ninth century be in its artistic work `` the spiritually free and most self-sufficient between past and future '' , and the loving skill spend by its artist upon their product be a testimonial to their sense that what they were do be important and be appreciated . 
geometric pottery has not_yet receive the thorough , detailed study which it deserve , partly because the task be a mammoth one and partly because some of its local manifestation , as at location , are only now come_to_light . 
from even a cursory inspection of its many aspect , however , the historian can deduce several fundamental conclusion about the progress of the aegean world down to 800 bc 
the general intellectual outlook which had appear in the eleventh century was now consolidate to a significant degree . 
much which be in_embryo in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800 . 
in this process the minoan mycenaean inheritance had been transmute or finally reject ; the aegean world which had exist before 1000 differ from that which rise more clearly in our vision after 800 . 
those modern scholar who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of aegean development from early times - granted occasional irruption of people and idea from outside - be correct ; but all_too many observer have been mislead by this fact into minimize the degree of change which take_place in the early first millennium . 
the focus of novelty in this world now lie_in the southeastern district of the greek mainland , and by 800 virtually the entire aegean , always except its northern shore , had accept the geometric style of pottery . 
while protogeometric vase usually turn_up , especially outside greece proper , together with as_many or more example of local stamp , these `` non greek '' pattern had mostly vanish by the late ninth century . 
in their place come local variation within the common style - tentative , as_it_were , in protogeometric product but truly distinct and sharply defined as the geometric spirit develop . 
attica , though important , be not the only teacher of this age . 
one can take a vase of about 800 bc and , without any knowledge of its place_of_origin , venture to assign it to a specific area ; imitation and borrowing of motif now become ascertainable . 
the potter of the aegean_island thus stand apart from those of the mainland , and in greece itself argive , corinthian , attic , boeotian , and other geometric sequence have each their own hallmark . 
these local variation were to become ever sharp in the next century and a half . 
the same conclusion can be draw from the other physical evidence of the dark_ages , from linguistic distribution , and from the survival of early social , political , and religious pattern into late age . 
by 800 bc the aegean be an area of common tongue and of common culture . 
on these pillar rest that solid basis for life and thought which was soon to be manifest in the remarkably unlimited ken of the iliad . 
everywhere within the common pattern , however , one find local diversity ; greek history and culture were enduringly fertilize , and plague , by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factor . 
further we cannot go , for the dark_ages deserve their name . 
many aspect of civilization were not_yet sufficiently crystallize to find expression , nor could the simple economic and social foundation of this world support a lofty structure . 
the epic_poem , the consolidation of the greek pantheon , the rise of firm political_unit , the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representation of man - all these had to await the progress of following decade . 
what we have see in this chapter , we have see only dimly , and yet the result , however general , be worth the search . 
these be the century in which the inhabitant of the aegean world settle firmly into their mind and into their institution the foundation of the hellenic outlook , independent of outside force . 
to interpret , indeed , the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect bear of our lack of detailed information ; if we could see more deeply , we probably would find many side issue and wrong turning which come to an end within the period . 
the historian can only point_out those line which be major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence , and must hope that future excavation will enrich our understanding . 
throughout the dark_ages , it be clear , the greek world had been develop slowly but consistently . 
the pace could now be accelerate , for the inhabitant of the aegean stood_on_firm_ground . 
the landscape of greek history broaden widely , and rather abruptly , in the eighth century bc , the age of homer 's `` rosy fingered dawn '' . 
the first slanting ray of the new day cannot yet dispel all the dark shadow which lie across the aegean world ; but our evidence grow considerably in variety and show more unmistakably some of the line of change . 
for this period , as for early century , pottery remain the most secure source ; the ceramic material of the age be more abundant , more diversified , and more indicative_of the hope and fear of its maker , who begin to show scene of human life and death . 
figurine and simple chapel presage the emergence of sculpture and architecture in greece ; object in gold , ivory , and bronze grow more numerous . 
since writing was practice in the aegean before the end of the century , we may hope that the detail of tradition will now be occasionally useful . 
though it be not easy to apply the evidence of the iliad to any specific era , this marvelous product of the epic tradition had certainly take_shape definitive shape by 750 . 
the dipylon_geometric pottery of athens and the iliad be amazing manifestation of the inherent potentiality of greek civilization ; but both be among the last product of a phase which was end . 
greek civilization was swirl toward its great revolution , in which the developed quality of the hellenic outlook were suddenly to break forth . 
the revolution be well underway before 700 bc , and premonitory sign go_back virtually across the century . 
the era , however , be janus-faced . 
while many token point forward , the main achievement stand as a culmination of the simple pattern of the dark_ages . 
the dominant pottery of the century be geometric ; political organization revolve_about the basileus ; trade was just begin to expand ; the god who protect the greek countryside were only now put_on their sharply anthropomorphic dress . 
the modern student , who know what was to come next , be likely to place first the factor of change which be visible in the eighth century . 
not all man of the period would have accept this emphasis . 
many potter cling_to the past the more determinedly as they were confront with radically new idea ; the poet of the iliad deliberately archaize . 
although it be not possible to sunder old and new in this era , i shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decade of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an apogee of the first stage of greek civilization . 
on this principle of division i must postpone the evolution of sculpture , architecture , society , and politics ; for the development in these area make_sense only if they be connected to the age of revolution itself . 
the growing contact between aegean and orient be also a phase which should be link primarily to the remarkable broadening of hellenic culture after 750 . 
we shall not be able entirely to pass_over these connection to the east as we consider ripe_geometric pottery , the epic and the myth , and the religious evolution of early greece ; the important point , however , be that these magnificent achievement , unlike those of later decade , were only incidentally influence by oriental model . 
the antecedent of dipylon vase and of the iliad lie_in the aegean past . 
the pottery of the first_half of the eighth century is commonly called ripe_geometric . 
the severe yet harmonious vase of the previous fifty year , the strong geometric style of the late ninth century , display as firm a mastery of the principle underlying geometric pottery ; but artist now be ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance . 
the vase which result have different shape , far more complex decoration , and a larger sense of style . 
beyond the aesthetic and technical aspect of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broad line . 
in earlier century man had have enough to do in rebuild a fundamental sense of order after chaos . 
they had had_to work_on very simple foundation and had not dared to give rein to impulse . 
the potter , in_particular , had virtually eschew freehand drawing , elaborate motif , and the curving line of nature , while yet express a belief that there be order in the universe . 
in their vase were embody the basic aesthetic and logical characteristic of greek civilization , at_first hesitantly in protogeometric work , and_then more confidently in the initial stage of the geometric style . 
by 800 social and cultural security had been achieve , at_least on a simple plane ; it be time to take big step , to venture on experiment . 
ripe_geometric potter continue to employ the old syntax of ornament and shape and make use of the well-defined though limited range of motif which they had inherit . 
in these respect the vase of the early eighth century represent a culmination of earlier line of progress . 
to the ancestral lore , however , new material were add . 
painter leave less and less of a vase in a plain dark color ; instead they divide the surface into many band or cover it by all-over pattern into which freehand drawing begin to creep . 
wavy line , feather like pattern , rosette of indefinitely floral nature , bird either singly or in stylized row , animal in solemn frieze band ( see plate 11 - 12 ) - all these turn_up in the more developed fabric as preliminary sign that the potter were broaden their gaze . 
the row of animal and bird , in_particular , suggest awareness of oriental animal frieze , transmit perhaps via syrian silver bowl and textile , but the specific form of these row on local vase and metal product be nonetheless greek . 
though the spread of this type of decoration in the aegean has not_yet been precisely determine , it seem to appear first in the cyclades , which be among the leading exporter of pottery throughout the century . 
as the material at the command of the potter grow and the volume of their production increase , the local variation within a common style become more evident . 
plate 12 illustrate four example , which be ripe or late_geometric work of common spirit but of different school . 
person had discover a beef in his possession a_few day earlier and , when he could not show the hide , arrest him . 
think the evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later release him . 
even while suffer the trip to his home , person swear to person and person that he would kill the indian . 
three week later following his recovery , armed with a writ issue by the location justice on affidavit prepare by the district_attorney , person and person ride to arrest person . 
arrive at daybreak , they find person in his corral and demand that he surrender . 
instead , he whirl and run to his house for a gun force them to kill him , person report . 
both person 's and person 's life were threaten by the mexican following the killing , but the company officer feel that in_the_end , it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion . 
general_manager person even suggest that it might be wise to keep the mexican in suspense rather_than accept their offer to sell_out and move away , and try to have a_few punish . 
on february 17 , person and person were send to the location community on the location to see about rent_out ranch the company had purchase . 
while talk with person , person and person appear , both heavily armed , and after watch the house for_a_while , ride_away . 
it be nearly sundown before they finish the business with person and begin ride down the stream . 
they had travel only a short distance when they spot five mexican ride along a horse-trail across the stream just ahead of them . 
suspect an ambush , the two deputy decide to ride up a side canyon take a shortcut into location . 
after spend two night ( wednesday and thursday ) in location , the deputy again head for the location to finish their business . 
they stay with a rancher friday night and by eleven o'clock saturday morning pass the old person ranch . 
half a mile below at the mouth of location be an old ranch that the company had purchase from person , occupy by a mexican , his wife , and an old trapper . 
there be three house in location just at the foot of a low bluff , the road wind along the top , enter above , and_then pass down in_front_of the house , thence to the location . 
to the west of this road be another low bluff , forty or fifty foot high , covered with scrub_oak and other brush . 
as they were ride along this wind road on the bench of land between the two bluff , a volley of rifle fire suddenly crash around the two officer . 
not a bullet touch person who be nearer the ambush , but one hit person in the leg and another break his arm , pass_on through his body . 
with the first report , person 's horse wheel to the right and run towards the building while person , follow by a hail of bullet , race towards the arroyo of location immediately in_front_of him , just reach it as his horse fall . 
grab his winchester from its sheath , person prepare to fight from behind the arroyo bank . 
bullet be so thick , throw sand in his face , that he find it difficult to return the fire . 
notice person 's horse in_front_of the long log building , he assume his friend had slip inside and would be able to put_up a good fight , so he begin work his way down the ditch to join him . 
at a very shallow place , two mexican rush into the open for a shot . 
drop to one knee , cook fell one , and the other struggle off with his comrade , send no further fire in his direction . 
just before leave the arroyo where he was partially concealed , he did hear shot down at the house . 
person had reach the house as person surmise , dismount , but just as the old trapper open the door to receive him , he fall into the trapper 's arm - dead . 
a bullet fire by one of the mexican hide in a little chicken house had pass_through his head , tear a hole two inch square on the outgoing side . 
find him dead , person catch person 's horse and ride to the cattle foreman 's house to report the incident and request bloodhound to trail the assassin . 
before daylight sunday morning , a posse of twenty-three man under the leadership of person of location follow the trail to the house of person , where 100 to 150 mexican had gather . 
person boldly approach the fortified adobe_house and demand entrance . 
the men inside inform him that they have some wounded men among them but he would not be allow to see them even_though he offer medical_aid . 
the officer demand the name of the injured man ; the mexican not_only refuse to give them , but tell the posseman if they want a fight they could have it . 
since the strength of the mexican had been underrate , too small a posse had been collect , and since the deputy had not been provide with search_warrant , person and his man decide it be much wise to withdraw . 
the posse 's retreat encourage the mexican to be overbearing and impudent . 
during the following week , six ton of hay belong to one rancher were burn ; some building , farm tool , two horse , plow , and hay own by person , a friendly interpreter for the company , and person ' hay were steal or destroy ; and a store was break into and rob . 
district_attorney person warn that he would vigorously prosecute person catch commit these crime or carry arms - he just did n't catch anyone . 
increasing threat on his life finally convince person that he should leave new_mexico . 
his friend advise that it would be only a question of time until either the mexican kill him by ambuscade or he would be compel to kill them in self-defense , perpetuate the trouble . 
by early summer , he write from location that he was suffer from the wound inflict in the ambush and be in_a_bad_way financially , so person send him a draft for $ 100 , warn that it be still not wise for him to return . 
person also send a check for $ 100 to person 's widow and have a white marble monument erect on his grave . 
cattle steal and killing , again serious during the spring of 1891 , place the land_grant company officer in a perplexing position . 
they be reluctant to appoint sheriff to protect the property , thus run_a_risk of create disturbance such_as that on the location , and yet the cowboy protest that they get no salary for arrest cattle_thief and run_a_risk of being shoot . 
and the law virtually ignore the situation . 
the judge become ill just as the group convene , no substitute was bring_in , no criminal case hear , only 5 out of 122 case docket were try , and court adjourn sine_die after sit a_few day instead_of the usual three week . 
person complain : 
`` litigant and witness were put to the expense and inconvenience of go long distance to transact business ; public money spend ; justice delay ; nothing accomplish , and the whole distribution of justice in this county seem to be an absolute farce '' . 
word reach the company that the man behind these depredation be person , a man with many follower , include a number who were keep in line through fear of him . 
although want by the sheriff for kill an old_man name person , the warrant for his arrest had never been serve . 
on may 19 , a deputy_sheriff 's posse of eight man leave location and ride thirty-five mile up the location where they were join by person . 
by 3 : 00 a.m. they reach his house and find it vacant . 
when they were refuse entrance to his brother 's house nearby , they smash down the door , break the window , and throw lighted clothes wet with kerosene into the room . 
still there be no person and the family would say nothing . 
about 300 yard up the creek be a cluster of mexican house contain six room in the form of a square . 
while prowl around these building , two of the posse recognize the voice of person speak_to the people inside . 
he was promise that no harm would befall him if he would come_out , but he curse and reply that he would shoot any man come_near the door . 
the posse then ask that he send_out the woman and child as the building would be fire or tear_down over his head if necessary to take him dead or alive . 
again he refuse . 
in deadly earnest , the besieger methodically strip away portion of the roof and toss lighted rag inside , only to have most stamp_out by the woman as_soon_as they hit the floor . 
when it become obvious that he could stay inside no_longer , take a_thousand to one chance person rush outside , square against the muzzle of a winchester . 
shoot near the heart , he turn to one side and plunge for a door to another room several foot away , three bullet follow him . 
as he push open the door he fall on his face , one of his comrade pull him inside . 
not realize the seriousness of the wound , the besieger warn that if he did not surrender the house would be burn_down around him . 
receive no answer , they set_on_fire the fire . 
when the house be about half consume , his comrade run to the door and throw up his hand , declare repeatedly that he did not know the whereabouts of person . 
find it true that he be not inside , the deputy return to the first house and tear hole through the side and the roof until they could see a body on the bed covered by a blanket . 
several slug fire into the bed jerk aside the blanket to reveal an apparently lifeless hand . 
shoot six or eight time the body be draped with person 's pistol , belt , and cartridge . 
there be no extra horse so it was leave to his comrade who , though number in the fifty , had stand around on the hillside nearby without fire a shot during the entire attack . 
early the next morning , a mexican telephone person that person , one of the posse member , be surround by ten mexican at his father 's home on the upper location . 
the sheriff and person hastily swear_out a number of warrant against man who had been ride about armed , according_to signed statement by person and person , and order person of location to rescue the posseman . 
travel all night , person and twelve man arrive at about seven o'clock may 22 . 
occasionally they hear gunshot signal and a number of horseman were sight on the hills , disappear at the posse 's approach . 
a mexican justice_of_the_peace had issue a writ against person for take_part in the `` murder '' of person so he and his father be anxious to be take_out of danger . 
the man help them gather their belongings and escort them to location along with three other family desire to leave . 
the ten or more dangerous party single_out for prosecution be still at_large , and person realize that if these man entrench themselves in their adobe_house , defend themselves through loophole , it would be most difficult to capture them . 
thus he wire group of denver : `` have you any percussion hand_grenade for throw in a house or across a well load with ball or shrapnel shot ? 
if_not , how long to order and what be the price '' ? 
he wisely decide that it would be foolish to create a disturbance during the coming roundup , particularly since the mexican be on_guard their guard . 
his problem then become one of restrain the american fighter who wanted to clean_out the person by force immediately . 
the plant be located west of the location and south of the location of the former electric_light plant . 
the group issue 214 share of stock at $ 10 each for construction of a sewer in that locality , and assessment were make for its maintenance . 
it has give considerable trouble at_times and empty right into the battenkill . 
location discuss its possible purchase in 1945 , but consider it an unwise investment . 
the sewer on location was construct when there be only a_few house on the street . 
as new home were build they were connect so that all residence south of location are serve by it . 
person be the present treasurer and manager . 
the 1946 town_meeting vote to have the selectman appoint a committee to investigate and report on the feasibility of some system of sewage_disposal and a disposal_plant to serve location , location , and location . 
the committee submit a report sign by person and person with a map publish in the 1946 town report . 
the layout of the sewer_line was design by person , who be the engineer for the location disposal_plant . 
no figure were submit with the report and no action was take on it by the town . 
the 1958 town_meeting direct town authority to seek federal and state funds with which to conduct a preliminary survey of a proposed sewage plant with its attendant facility . 
the final step be a vote for a $ 230000 bond issue for the construction of a sewage_system by the 1959 town_meeting , later confirm by a two-thirds vote at a special town_meeting june_21 , 1960 . 
there the matter stand with the prospect that soon manchester may be remove from the roster of town contribute raw sewage to its main stream . 
manchester 's unusual interest in telegraphy has often been attribute to the fact that the person , headmaster of group and group , be a personal friend and correspondent of the inventor , person . 
at_any_rate , manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system which was set_up in 1844 between baltimore and washington . 
in 1846 person , jeweler and watchmaker , become the town 's first telegrapher in a dwelling he build for himself and his business `` two door north of the location '' or `` one door north of the group , manchester , vermont '' . 
person be telegrapher for the `` group '' and the `` group '' . 
share of capital_stock at $ 15 each in the latter company be payable at the group or at various other vermont bank . 
a message of less_than fifteen word to bennington cost twenty-five cent . 
by 1871 person , manager of the `` group '' , express willingness to send emergency telegram on sunday from his village drugstore . 
person even needed to hire an assistant , person . 
the group comment editorially on the surprising amount of local telegraphic business . 
in the fall of 1878 , the `` group '' was establish between manchester and location by the owner , person , person , person , and person . 
the line soon live_up_to its name , as local message of moderate length could be send for a dime and the company be quickly able to declare very liberal dividend on its capital_stock . 
in 1879 the same person , with person of location , form the `` group '' , extend from location via location and location to location . 
besides be most convenient , the line `` soon prove a good investment for the owner '' . 
telegrapher at the location at this time be person and person of `` group '' , dealer in lumber and drygoods . 
early equipment be very flimsy ; the smallest gust of wind topple pole , make communication impossible . 
but company continue to spring_up . 
by 1883 the `` group '' be in existence and person be its president . 
operate in 1887 was the `` group '' , officer of which be person , president ; person , vice_president and secretary ; person , treasurer ; person , superintendent ; person , assistant superintendent . 
two company now have headquarters with person , who by then have his own drugstore at location - the `` group '' and the `` group '' . 
operator be person and person . 
still exist on a `` group '' telegraph_form is a typical peremptory message from location grocer person to person and person ' store in manchester - `` get and send by stage sure four pound best porterhouse or sirloin steak , for person send six sweet_orange '' . 
about 1888 person of location and person become proprietor of the `` group '' , connect all office on the group line and extend over the mountain from location to location , location , location , location , location , location , location , location , location , and location . 
from 1896 until 1910 person be manager of group at the location in the drugstore he purchase from person . 
the village office of group with person as manager and telegrapher continue in person 's drugstore until 1905 . 
during the summer , person often need the assistance of a company_operator . 
these be the year when people flock to manchester not_only to play golf , which had come into vogue , but also to witness the location country_club tournament . 
new_yorker were keep informed of scores by reporter who telegraph fifteen to twenty thousand word daily to the metropolitan newspaper . 
this boost local telegraph business and manchester bask in all the free advertising . 
in 1914 when the town was choose for the group tournament , a representative hurry here from the boston manager 's office . 
in his wake come the person and the cream of the telegraphic profession , ten of boston 's best , choose for their long experience and thorough knowledge of golf . 
during that tournament alone , some 250000 word wing their way out of manchester . 
the old morse system was replace locally by the simplex modern automatic method in 1929 , when person ( person ) be manager of the group office . 
during summer , business be so brisk that person have two assistant and a messenger . 
she was succeed by person . 
since that time the telegraph office has shift in location from the railroad_station at the location and shop at the location back to the town_clerk 's office and drugstore at the village . 
after be located for some year in the location at the group under the supervision of person , it be presently located in the group , location . 
the first known telephone_line in manchester was establish in july 1883 between person and person 's store at location and the group in location . 
this was extend the following year to include the railroad_station agent 's office and location 's hotel at location . 
in november 1887 a line connect several dwelling_house in location was extend to location . 
telephone_wire from person 's house in location to the location lumber job near location be up about 1895 . 
person of location record the set of phone pole in location and location in his diary for 1906 . 
these must have been for local_call strictly , as in may 1900 the `` only long distance telephone '' in town was transfer from person 's to person 's shoe_store . 
a small single switchboard was install in the location over person 's hardware_store ( later person 's ) . 
person be manager and troubleshooter ; person be the first operator ; and a night operator was also employ . 
anyone fortunate enough to have one of those early phone advertise the fact along with the telephone_number in the location . 
in 1918 the group begin erect a building to house its operation on the corner of location and what be now location at location . 
service run through location and to location town east of the mountain be in the hands of the `` group '' in 1925 , but major supervision of telephone_line in manchester be with the group , which eventually gain all control . 
more aerial and underground equipment was install as_well as office improvement to take_care of the expanding business . 
in 1931 person , agent and chief operator , who was to retire in 1946 with thirty year ' service , lead agency office in sale for the year with $ 2490 . 
person , who retire in 1938 , be a veteran of thirty-four years ' local service . 
another veteran telephone_operator be person , who had be in the office forty years at the time of her death in 1960 . 
in 1932 person receive its own exchange , which make business easy for the location office , but it was not until february 1953 that area service was extend to include location and location . 
this eliminate toll_call between the two town . 
within a month , call be up seventy percent . 
electricity play such an important part in community life today that it be difficult to envision a time when current be not available for daily use . 
yet one has to go_back only some sixty year . 
the first mention of an electric plant in manchester seem to be one install in person 's and person 's gristmill on the location in location . 
no record be available as_to the date or extent of installation , but it may have be in 1896 . 
on june_14 , 1900 the manchester_journal report that an electrical_engineer was install an electric_light plant for person at `` location '' . 
this was work by the end of august and give satisfactory service . 
in november 1900 surveying was do under person on the east mountain to ascertain if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate an electric power_plant . 
nothing come of it , perhaps due_to lack of opportunity for water storage . 
the next step be construction by the group of a plant on the west bank of the location south of location bridge . 
this was nearly complete may 23 , 1901 with a promise of light by june 10 , but the first light did not go_on until september 28 . 
it be at the end of the sidewalk in_front of the group cottage . 
the first director of the group be person , person , person , person , and person . 
the officer be person , president ; person , vice_president ; person , treasurer ; and person , secretary . 
person be manager of the company for ten year and manager of its successor company , the group , for one year . 
at about the time the person enterprise was get underway , the group start construction of a chair stock factory on the site of the present group , intend to use its surplus power for generate electricity . 
location then have two compete power_company until 1904 , when the group purchase the transmission system of the group . 
this be fortunate , as the group plant burn in 1905 . 
the group was succeed by the group , which in_turn was absorb by the group . 
the latter now furnish the area with electricity distribute from a modern substation at location which was put into operation february 19 , 1930 and was improve in january 1942 by the installation of larger transformer . 
for a time following the abandonment of the local plant , electric_current for location was bring_in from the south with an emergency tie-in with the group system to_the_north . 
some who have write on utopia have treat it as `` a learned diversion of a learned world '' , `` a phantasy with which person amuse himself '' , `` a holiday work , a spontaneous overflow of intellectual high_spirits , a revel of debate , paradox , comedy and invention '' . 
with_respect_to this view , two point be worth make . 
first , it appear to be based on the fact that on its title_page utopia is describe as `` festivus '' , `` gay '' . 
it overlook the other fact that it is describe as `` nec minus salutaris quam festivus '' , `` no less salutary than gay '' . 
it also overlook the fact that in a rational lexicon , and quite clearly in person 's lexicon , the opposite of serious be not gay but frivolous , and the opposite of gay be not serious but solemn . 
person believe that a man could be both serious and gay . 
that a writer who be gay cannot be serious be a common professional illusion , sedulously foster by all_too many academic who mistakenly believe that their frivolous effort should be take seriously because they are express with that dreary solemnity which be the only mode of expression their author be capable of . 
secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in person 's account of the stupid brutality of early sixteenth century war , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful require a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in person himself . 
indeed , it be even surprising in the canon of group and regius_professor of ecclesiastical history , who father this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant professor of medieval and renaissance_english at cambridge , who inherit it and be now its most eminent proponent . 
but to return to the main line of our inquiry . 
it be doubtful that utopia is still widely read because person be medieval or even because he be a martyr - indeed , it be likely that these day many who read utopia with interest do not even know that its author be a martyr . 
utopia is still widely read because in_a_sense person stand on the margin of modernity . 
and if he did stand on the margin of modernity , it be not in die a martyr for such unity as papal supremacy might be able to force on western christendom . 
it be not even in writing latin epigram , sometimes bawdy ones , or in translate person from greek into latin or in defend the study of greek against the attack of conservative academic , or in attack the conservative theologian who oppose person 's philological study of the new_testament . 
similar literary exercise be the common doing of a christian humanist of the first two decade of the sixteenth century . 
had person 's writing been wholly limited to such exercise , they would be almost as dimly remember as those of a dozen or_so other author live in his time , whose works tenuously survive in the mind of the few hundred scholar who each decade in pursuit of their very specialized occasions read those work . 
person stand on the margin of modernity for one reason alone - because he write utopia . 
and the evidence that he does , indeed , stand there derive quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual reader have respond to that book for the past century or_so . 
only one other contemporary of person 's evoke so immediate and direct a response , and only one other contemporary work - person and the_prince . 
can we discover what it be in utopia that has evoke this response ? 
remember that in seek the modern in utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the renaissance there ; we do not even need to commit ourselves to assess on the same inconceivable scale the relative importance of the medieval , the renaissance , and the modern . 
the medieval be the most important to person because he seek to place person , the author of utopia , in some intelligible relation with person , the martyr . 
to others whose concern it be to penetrate the significance of christian_humanism , the renaissance element be of primary concern . 
but here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation ; we want to know why that book has keep_on sell the way it has ; we want_to know what be perennially new about utopia . 
what be new about it ? 
to that question the answer be simple ; it can be make in two word , utopian communism . 
but it be an answer which open the door wide to an onrush of objection and denial . 
surely there be nothing new about communism . 
we find it in plato 's republic , and in utopia person acknowledge his debt to that book . 
we find it in that `` common way_of_life pleasing to christ and still in_use among the true society of christian '' , that_is , the good monastery which make it easy to convert the utopian to christianity . 
we find it in the later stoic conception of man 's natural condition which include the community of all possession . 
this conception was take_up by the early church_father and by canon lawyer and theologian in the middle_ages ; and person be far too well-read not to have come_across it in one or several of the form thus give it . 
but although the idea of communism be very old even in person 's day and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515 , it be not communism as_such that we are concern with . 
we are concern not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus : 
platonic , stoic , early christian , monastic , canonist or theological communism ; we are concern with utopian communism - that_is , simply communism as it appear in the imaginary commonwealth of utopia , as person conceive it . 
perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity of utopian communism be to contrast it with the principal early type of communistic theory . 
we will achieve a more vivid sense of what it be by realize what it be not . 
in plato 's republic communism be - to speak anachronistically - a communism of janissary . 
its function be to separate from the base ruled mass , among whom private ownership prevail , the governing warrior elite . 
moreover , it is too readily forget that in the republic what give the initial impetus to plato 's excursus into the construction of an imaginary commonwealth with its ruling_class communism of goods , wife , and child , be his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of the individual human psyche ; and it is to this problem that the republic ultimately return . 
in person 's utopia communism be not a means of separate_out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass . 
utopian communism apply to all utopian . 
and in the economy of the book it be not peripheral but central . 
the concern of utopia be with the optimo reipublicae statu , the best ordering of a civil society ; and it is again_and_again make clear that utopian communism provide the institutional array indispensable to that best ordering . 
to derive utopian communism from the jerusalem christian community of the apostolic age or from its medieval successor in spirit , the monastic community , be with an appropriate shift of adjective , misleading in the same way as to derive it from plato 's republic : 
in the republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual athlete , in the apostolic and monastic community with an elite of spiritual and religious athlete . 
the apostolic community be literally an elite : choose by christ himself . 
and the monastic community were supposed to be make_up of volunteer select only after a novitiate which would test their religious aptitude for monastic rigor , their spiritual athleticism . 
finally , the conception of the natural community of all possession which originate with the stoic was firmly fix in a tradition by person 's time , although it was not accept by all the theologian philosopher of the middle_ages . 
in that tradition communism lie a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the fall of man . 
it did not serve to contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order , because the age of innocence be not a possible alternative once man had sin . 
the actual function of patristic civilian canonist scholastic communism was adequately set_forth by person almost a millennium before person write utopia . 
`` the soil be common to all man . 
when we give the necessity of life to the poor , we restore to them what be already theirs . 
we should think_of it more as an act of justice than compassion '' . 
because community not severalty of property be the law_of_nature no man can assert an absolutely unalterable right to what be his . 
indeed , of all that be his every man be by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligated to regard_as himself as a custodian . 
he be a trustee for the common good , however feeble the safeguard which the positive or municipal law of property provide against his misuse of that share of the common fund , wisely or unwisely , entrust to his keeping . 
in_contrast_to this stoic patristic view , utopia imply that the nature of man be such that to rely_on individual conscience to supply the deficiency of municipal law be to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness in a sieve . 
the utopian brace conscience with legal sanction . 
in a properly order society the massive force of public_law perform the function which in natural_law theory ineptly is leave altogether to a small_voice so often still . 
in all the respect just indicate utopian communism differ from previous conception in which community of possession and living play a role . 
neither from one of these conception nor from a combination of them can it be deduce . 
we do not deny originality to the agamemnon because aeschylus find the tale of the house of person among the folklore of the greek . 
in a like sense whatever bit or shred of previous conception one may find in it , utopian communism remain , as an integral whole , original - a new thing . 
it be not merely a new thing ; it be one of the very few new thing in utopia ; most_of the rest be medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism . 
but to say that at a moment in history something be new be not necessarily to say that it be modern ; and for this statement the best evidence come within the five year following the publication of utopia , when person elaborate a new perception of the nature of the divine 's encounter with man . 
new , indeed , be person 's perception , but not modern , as anyone know who has ever try to make intelligible to modern student what person was get at . 
although utopian communism be both new in 1516 and also modern , it be not modern communism or even modern socialism , as they exist or have ever exist in_theory or in_practice . 
consider the feature of utopian communism : 
generous public provision for the infirm ; democratic and secret election of all officer include priest , meal take publicly in common refectory ; a common habit or uniform prescribe for all citizen ; even house change once a decade ; six hour of manual_labor a day for all but a handful of magistrate and scholar , and careful measure to prevent anyone from shirk ; no private_property , no money ; no sort of price at_all for any goods or service , and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term . 
whatever the merit of its intent , utopian communism be far too naive , far too crude , to suit any modern socialist or communist . 
it be not the detail of utopian communism that make utopia modern , it be the spirit , the attitude of mind that inform those detail . 
what that spirit and attitude be we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrast with the communist tradition with the long continuous history , the one which reach christianity by_the_way_of stoicism through the church_father of late antiquity . 
during the person trial the democratic press condemn the proceeding and herald person as a martyr to the principle of the declaration_of_independence . 
during the person trial , however , the state 's most powerful democratic newspaper , the group , state that person be a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his associate , with the assistance of republican and abolitionist , had plot not_only the liberation of the slave but also the overthrow of state_government and federal_government . 
the group answer the group by state that the raid of person be characteristic of democratic act of violence and that `` he was act in direct opposition to the republican_party , who proclaim as one of their cardinal principle that they do not interfere with slavery in the state '' . 
the two major newspaper in providence continue , throughout the crisis , to accuse each other of misrepresent the fact and attempt to falsify history . 
while the group continue to accuse republican and the group continue to accuse democrat , the group complain that the virginia authority show indecent and cowardly haste to condemn person and his men . 
person state , `` of their guilt there can be no_doubt but they are entitle to sufficient time to prepare for trial , and a fair trial '' . 
the group think that there be probably good reason for the haste in which the trial was being conduct and that the only thing gain by a delay would be calm feeling . 
the group state that although the guilt of person be evident , the south must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace . 
on october 31 , 1859 , person was find guilty of treason against the state of virginia , incite slave rebellion , and murder . 
for these crime he was sentence to be hang in_public on friday , december 2 , 1859 . 
upon receive the news , northern writer , editor , and clergyman heap accusation of murder on the southern state , particularly virginia . 
although rhode_islander were prepare for the state election , they watch person 's trial with extreme interest . 
on wednesday morning , november_2 , 1859 , the group state that although person justly deserve the extreme penalty , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the penalty without a fair trial . 
the editor 's main criticism of the trial be the haste with which it was conduct . 
the reader of the group , however , learn that it was generally concede that `` person '' have a fair trial . 
concern the sentence the editor ask , `` what else can virginia do than to hang the man who have defy her law , organize treason , and butcher her citizen '' . 
in the eastern section of the state the newspaper ' reaction to person 's trial and sentence be basically identical . 
person , editor of the group state that `` the end of justice must be satisfy , a solitary example must be set , in_order_that all those misname philanthropist [ sic ] , who , actuate by a blind zeal , dare to instigate riot , treason , and murder , may heed it and shape their future course accordingly '' . 
the editor of the group could discover no evidence of extenuate circumstance in the person trial which would warrant make an exception to the infliction of capital_punishment . 
in direct_contrast to the other rhode_island editor , person of the group outwardly condemn the trial as be completely unfair . 
concern the sentence , person write , `` if it be possible that mercy shall override vengeance and that person 's sentence shall be commute to imprisonment , it would be well - well for the country and for virginia '' . 
despite the excitement being cause by the trial and sentence of person , rhode_islander turn their attention to the state election . 
the state had elect republican candidate in the past two year . 
there be no_doubt as_to the control the group exercise throughout the state . 
if it fail on_occasion to elect its candidate for general state office by majority , the failure be due_to a lingering remnant of the know-nothing party , which call itself the american group . 
the person and the republican both nominate lieutenant_governor person for governor . 
person be the democratic candidate . 
the result of the election of 1859 find republican candidate not_only win the office of governor and lieutenant_governor but also obtain the two congressional office from the eastern and western section of the state . 
during the month of november hardly_a day pass when there be not some mention of person in the rhode_island newspaper . 
on november 7 , 1859 , the group reprint a letter send to person from `` person '' , a quaker lady in newport . 
in reference_to person 's raid she write , `` though we be non-resistant and religiously believe it better to reform by moral and not by carnal weapon we know thee was animate [ sic ] by the most generous and philanthropic motive '' . 
`` person '' compare person to moses in_that they were both act to deliver millions from oppression . 
in contrast to `` person '' , most rhode_islander hardly think_of person as be another person . 
most attempt to develop any sympathy for person and his action find an unresponsive audience in rhode_island . 
on wednesday evening , november 23 , 1859 , in location , person of location , give a `` mission_of_sympathy '' lecture in which he favorably view the location insurrection . 
the group state that many of person 's remark be inappropriate and savor strongly of radicalism and fanaticism . 
in its account of the person lecture , the group say that the remark of person make the people indignant . 
no sympathy or admiration for person could be find in the group , for the editor claim that there be a score of man in the state_prison who be a_thousand time more deserving of sympathy . 
the group , however , state that person 's courage , bravery , and heroism `` in a good cause would make a man a martyr ; it give something of dignity even to a bad one '' . 
the group admit that person might deserve punishment or imprisonment `` but he should no_more be hang than person or person '' . 
the group exhibit more concern over the possibility of the abolitionist make a martyr of person than it did over the development of sympathy for him . 
in her letter to person , `` person '' , the quakeress from newport , had suggest that the american people owe more honor to person for seek to free the slave than they did to person . 
during the latter day of november to the day of person 's execution , it seem that most rhode_islander did not concur in `` person 's '' suggestion . 
on november 22 , 1859 , the group state that although person 's `` pluck '' and honest fanaticism must be admire , any honor pay to person would only induce other fanatic to imitate his action . 
a week later the group had discover the initial plan of some providence citizen to hold a meeting honor person on the day of his execution . 
the editor of the group warn , `` that if such a demonstration be make , it will not find support or countenance from any of the man whose name are recognize as have a right to speak_for providence '' . 
the group 's editor write that he could not believe that a meeting honor person was to be hold in providence . 
he further call_upon the people of providence to rebuke the meeting and avoid disgrace . 
on december 2 , 1859 , person was hang at location , virginia . 
extraordinary precaution were take so that no stranger be allow_in the city and no citizen within the enclosure surround the scaffold . 
in many northern town and city meeting were hold and church_bell were toll . 
such be not the case in rhode_island . 
the only public demonstration in honor of person was hold at location in location , on the day of his execution . 
despite the opposition of the city newspaper , the location meeting `` bring_together a very respectable audience , compose in part of those who had been distinguish for year for their radical view upon the subject of slavery , of many_of our colored citizen , and of those who were attract to the place by the novelty of such a gathering '' . 
seat on the platform were person , ex-mayor of providence and a wealthy republican stove manufacturer ; person , an uncompromising person ; the person , a unitarian minister ; the person , a free_will baptist ; person , and person . 
the latter two be appointed secretary . 
the first speaker be person who had been unanimously choose president of the meeting . 
he speak of his desire to promote the abolition of slavery by peaceable means and he compare person of location to the person of rhode_island 's colonial period . 
person conclude that as rhode_island 's person become a canonized hero , if not a saint , so would it be with person of location . 
the next speaker be person . 
although admit person 's guilt on legal grounds , person say that , `` person be no common criminal ; his deed be not below , but above the law '' . 
following person be person who speak of his disapproval of person 's attempt at servile insurrection , his admiration of person 's character , and his opposition to slavery . 
person 's remark were applaud by a portion of the audience several time and once there be hissing . 
the fourth and last speaker be person . 
by this time large_number of the audience had leave the hall . 
person commence his remark by an allusion to the general feeling of opposition which the meeting had encounter from many of the citizen and all the newspaper of the city . 
he say that the propriety or impropriety of such a gathering be a question that was to be settle by every man in accordance with the conviction of private judgment . 
in the remainder of his speech person speak of his admiration for person and warn those who take_part in the meeting that they `` be liable to the charge that they are supporting traitor and uphold man whom the law have condemn '' . 
he recall that in rhode_island a party opposed to the state 's condemnation of a man ( person ) proclaim the state 's action as a violation of the law of the land and the principle of human liberty . 
at the close of person ' speech the following preamble and resolution were read by the president , and on the question of their adoption pass unanimously : 
whereas , person has cheerfully risk his life in endeavor to deliver those who are deny all right and is this day doom to suffer death for his effort in behalf of those who have no helper : 
therefore , 
resolve that , while we most decidedly disapprove the method he adopt to accomplish his object , yet in his willingness to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom , we still recognize the quality of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit which true man have always admire and which history never fail to honor . 
resolve that his wrong and bereavement in kansas , occasion by the violence and brutality of those who be intent_on the propagation of slavery in that territory , call_for a charitable judgment upon his recent effort in virginia to undermine the despotism from which he had suffer , and commend his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice . 
resolve that the anti slavery sentiment is become ripe for resolute action . 
resolve , that we find in this fearful tragedy at location a reason for more earnest effort to remove the evil of slavery from the whole land as speedily as possible . 
on the morning following the location meeting the editor of the group write that although the meeting be mild and less extreme than those hold in other area for similar purpose , it could have been avoid completely . 
rather than being deceive , the eye is puzzle ; instead of see object in space , it see nothing more than - a picture . 
through 1911 and 1912 , as the cubist facet_plane 's tendency to adhere to the literal surface become hard and hard to deny , the task of keep the surface at arm's_length fall all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivance . 
to reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , person and person begin to mix sand and other foreign substance with their paint ; the granular texture thus create likewise called_attention_to the reality of the surface and be effective over much larger area . 
in certain other picture , however , person begin to paint area in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing . 
these area by_virtue_of their abrupt density of pattern , state the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drive the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescue - and set to shuttle again - only by conventional perspective ; that_is , by being place in such relation to the form depict within the illusion that these form leave no room for the typography except near the surface . 
the accumulation of such device , however , soon have the effect of telescope , even while separate , surface and depth . 
the process of flatten seem inexorable , and it become necessary to emphasize the surface still further in_order to prevent it from fuse with the illusion . 
it was for this reason , and no other that i can see , that in september 1912 , person take the radical and revolutionary step of paste actual piece of imitation woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of try to simulate its texture in paint . 
person say that he himself had already make his first collage toward the end of 1911 , when he glue a piece of imitation caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas . 
it is true that his first collage look more analytical_cubism than person 's , which would confirm the date he assign it . 
but it is also true that person be the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated texture as_well_as of typography ; and moreover , he had already begin to broaden and simplify the facet_plane of analytical_cubism as far back as the end of 1910 . 
when we examine what each master say be his first collage we see that much the same thing happen in each . 
( it makes no real difference that person 's collage be on_paper and eke_out in charcoal , while person 's be on canvas and eke_out in oil . ) 
by its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness , the affixed paper or cloth serve for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated texture had ever do . 
but here again , the surface declare device both overshoot and fall_short_of its aim . 
for the illusion of depth create by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else give_way immediately to an illusion of form in bas_relief , which give_way in_turn , and with equal immediacy , to an illusion that seem to contain both - or neither . 
because of the size of the area it cover , the pasted paper establish undepicted flatness bodily , as more than an indication or sign . 
literal flatness now tend to assert itself as the main event of the picture , and the device boomerang : the illusion of depth is render even more precarious than before . 
instead of isolate the literal flatness by specify and circumscribe it , the pasted paper or cloth release and spread it , and the artist seem to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with which to finish as_well_as start his picture . 
the actual surface become both ground and background , and it turn_out - suddenly and paradoxically - that the only place leave for a three-dimensional illusion be in_front of , upon , the surface . 
in their very first collage , person and person draw or paint over and on the affixed paper or cloth , so that certain_of the principal feature of their subject as depict seem to thrust_out into real , bas_relief space - or to be about to do so - while the rest of the subject remain imbed in , or flat upon , the surface . 
and the surface is driven back , in its very surfaceness , only by this contrast . 
in the upper center of person 's first collage , fruit_dish ( in person 's collection ) , a bunch of grape is render with such conventionally vivid sculptural effect as to lift it practically off the picture_plane . 
the trompe_l'oeil illusion here is no_longer enclose between parallel flatness , but seem to thrust through the surface of the drawing_paper and establish depth on top of_it . 
yet the violent immediacy of the wallpaper strip paste to the paper , and the only lesser immediacy of block_capital that simulate window lettering , manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture_plane so that it does not `` jump '' . 
at_the_same_time , the wallpaper strip themselves seem to be push into depth by the line and patch of shading charcoal upon them , and by their placement in_relation_to the block_capital ; and these capital seem in_turn to be push_back by their placement , and by contrast with the corporeality of the woodgraining . 
thus every part and plane of the picture keep change place in relative depth with every_other part and plane ; and it be as if the only stable relation leave among the different part of the picture be the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each have with the surface . 
and the same thing , more_or_less , can be say of the content of person 's first collage . 
in later collage of both master , a variety of extraneous material are use , sometimes in the same work , and almost always in_conjunction_with every other eye-deceiving and eye-undeceiving device they can think_of . 
the area adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed material - or simply of a painted in form - will be shade to pry that edge away from the surface , while something will be draw , paint or even paste over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth . 
plane define as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space , and a depth is suggest optically which be greater than that establish pictorially . 
all this expand the oscillation between surface and depth so_as to encompass fictive space in_front of the surface as_well_as behind it . 
flatness may now monopolize everything , but it be a flatness become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn_into illusion itself - at_least an optical if_not , properly_speaking , a pictorial illusion . 
depict , cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilate to the literal , undepicted kind , but at_the_same_time it react upon and largely transform the undepicted kind - and it does so , moreover , without deprive the latter of its literalness ; rather , it underpin and reinforce that literalness , re-create it . 
out of_this re-created literalness , the group subject re-emerge . 
for it had turn_out , by a further paradox of cubism , that the means to an illusion of depth and plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation or imaging . 
in the analytical_cubism phase of their cubism , person and person had not_only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply in_order to preserve it ; they had also had to generalize it - to the point , finally , where the illusion of depth and relief become abstracted from specific three-dimensional entity and was render largely as the illusion of depth and relief as_such : as a disembodied attribute and expropriated property detach from everything not itself . 
in_order to be save , plasticity had had to be isolate ; and as the aspect of the subject was transpose into those cluster of more_or_less interchangeable and contour obliterating facet_plane by which plasticity was isolate under the cubist method , the subject itself become largely unrecognizable . 
cubism , in its 1911 - 1912 phase ( which the_french , with justice , call `` hermetic '' ) be on the verge of abstract_art . 
it was then that person and person were confront with a unique dilemma : they had to choose between illusion and representation . 
if they opt_for illusion , it could only be illusion per_se - an illusion of depth , and of relief , so general and abstracted as to exclude the representation of individual object . 
if , on_the_other_hand , they opt_for representation , it had to be representation per_se - representation as image pure_and_simple , without connotation ( at_least , without more than schematic ones ) of the three-dimensional space in which the object represent originally exist . 
it was the collage that make the term of_this dilemma clear : the representational could be restore and preserve only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation had become , for_the_first_time , mutually_exclusive alternative . 
in_the_end , person and person plump_for the representational , and it would seem they did so deliberately . 
( this provide whatever real justification there be for the talk about `` reality '' . ) 
but the inner , formal_logic of cubism , as it work_out itself out through the collage , had just as much to do with shape their decision . 
when the smaller facet_plane of analytical_cubism were place upon or juxtapose with the large , dense shape form by the affixed material of the collage , they had to coalesce - become `` synthesize '' - into larger planar shape themselves simply in_order to maintain the integrity of the picture_plane . 
leave in their previous atomlike smallness , they would have cut_away too abruptly into depth ; and the broad , opaque shape of pasted paper would have been isolate in such a way as to make them jump_out of plane . 
large plane juxtapose with other large plane tend to assert themselves as independent shape , and to_the_extent that they be flat , they also assert themselves as silhouette ; and independent silhouette be apt to coincide with the recognizable contour of the subject from which a picture start ( if it does start from a subject ) . 
it was because of this chain_reaction as_much_as for any other reason - that_is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape - that the identity of depicted_object , or at_least part of them , re-emerge in person 's and person 's papiers colles and continue to remain more conspicuous there - but only as flattened silhouette - than in any of their painting do wholly in oil before the end of 1913 . 
analytical_cubism come to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; nor did synthetic_cubism fully begin there . 
only when the collage had been exhaustively translate into oil , and transform by this translation , did cubism become an affair of positive color and flat , interlocking silhouette whose legibility and placement create allusion to , if_not the illusion of , unmistakable three-dimensional identity . 
synthetic_cubism begin with person alone , late in 1913 or early in 1914 ; this be the_point at which he finally take the lead in cubist innovation away from person , never again to relinquish it . 
but even before that , person had glimpse and enter , for a moment , a certain revolutionary path in which no one had precede him . 
it was as though , in_that instant , he had feel the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly try to escape all_the_way back - or forward - to literal three-dimensionality . 
this he did by use utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage ( and of cubism in_general ) literally into the literal space in_front of the picture_plane . 
some time in 1912 , person cut_out and fold a piece_of_paper in the shape of a guitar ; to this he glue and fit other piece_of_paper and four taut string , thus create a sequence of flat surface in real and sculptural space to which there cling only the vestige of a picture_plane . 
the affixed element of collage were extrude , as_it_were , and cut_off from the literal pictorial surface to form a bas_relief . 
( los_angeles in 1957 finally bow to the skyscraper . ) 
and without high density in the core , rapid_transit system cannot be maintain economically , let_alone build from_scratch at today 's price . 
however , the building of freeway and garage cannot continue forever . 
the new interchange among the four los_angeles freeway , include the grade-constructed access , occupy by itself no less than eighty acre of downtown land , one-eighth of a square_mile , an area about the size of group in new_york . 
it be hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete constitute what the law call `` the highest and best use '' of centrally located urban land . 
as it affect the city 's fiscal situation , such an interchange be ruinous ; it remove forever from the tax roll property which should be tax to pay for the city services . 
subway improve land value without take_away land ; freeway boost valuation less ( because the garage they require be not prime building by_a_long_shot ) , and reduce the acreage that can be tax . 
downtown los_angeles be already two-thirds freeway , interchange , street , parking_lot and garage - one of those preposterous `` if '' statistic has already come to pass . 
the freeway with narrowly spaced interchange concentrate and mitigate the access problem , but it also act_as inevitably as an artificial , isolate boundary . 
city planner do not always use this boundary as effectively as they might . 
less ambitious freeway plan may be more successful - especially when the roadway and interchange are raised , allow_for cross access at many point and provide parking_area below the ramp . 
meanwhile , the automobile and its friend the truck have cost the central_city some of its industrial dominance . 
in ever great number , factory are locate in the suburb or in `` industrial_park '' removed from the city 's political jurisdiction . 
the appeal of the suburb be particularly strong for heavy industry , which must move bulky object along a lengthy assembly_line and want enough land_area to do the entire job on one floor . 
to light industry , the economy of be on one floor be much slight , but efficiency_engineer usually believe_in them , and manufacturer look_for way to cut cost cannot be prevent from turn_to efficiency_engineer . 
this movement of industry away from the central_city be not so catastrophically new as some prophet seem to believe . 
it be merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which form the pattern of virtually all american city . 
the big factory which be relatively near the center of our city - the rubber factory in location , group 's detroit plant , group 's pittsburgh works - often begin on these site at_a_time when that be the edge of the city , yet close to transport ( river ) , storage ( pier ) and power ( river ) . 
the `` leapfrog '' be a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam_turbine , and the time when the belt of residence surround the old factory area be not_yet blighted . 
the truck and the car give the manufacturer a new degree_of_freedom in select his plant site . 
until internal_combustion become cheap , he had_to be near a railroad_siding and a trolley_line or an existing large community of lower-class home . 
the railroad_siding be still important - it be usually , though not always , true that long_haul shipment by rail be cheap than trucking . 
but anybody who promise a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these day , and many business can live without the railroad . 
and there be now many million of worker for whom the factory with the big parking_lot , which can be reach by drive across or against the usual pattern of rush_hour traffic and grille route bus_line , be actually more convenient than the walk-to factory . 
group , group 's enormous installation at location and location , the pentagon , group in location , group and group in los_angeles , the new automobile assembly plant everywhere - none of these is substantially serve by any sort of conventional mass_rapid_transit . 
they be all suburban plant , rely_on the road to keep them supply with worker . 
and wherever the new thruway go_up their bank are lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry . 
the drive along massachusetts ' location , the bypass which make an arc about twenty mile from downtown boston , may be a vision of the future . 
the future could be worse . 
the plant along location are mostly well designed and nicely set against the new_england rock and tree . 
they can even be rather grand , like person 's monument to the astonishing success of group . 
but they deny the value of the city - the crowded , competitive , tolerant city , the `` melting_pot '' which give_off so many of the most admirable american quality . 
they be segregated business , combine again on one site the factory and the office , draw their work_force from segregated community . 
it be interesting to note how many of the plant on massachusetts ' location draw most of their income either from the government in noncompetitive cost-plus arrangement , or from the exploitation of patent which grant at_least a partial monopoly . 
while the factory be always the center of the labor_market , they be often on the city 's periphery . 
in spread the factory even farther , the automobile may not have change to any great extent the growth pattern of the city . 
even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt 's motel has be relatively painless ; the hotel-motel demarcation is become hard to find every_year . 
what hurt most be the damage the automobile has do to central_city retailing , especially in those city where public_transit be feeble . 
some retailing , of_course , always spread with the population - grocery_store , drugstore , local haberdashery and dress_shop , candy_store and the_like . 
but whenever a major purchase was contemplate forty year ago - a new bedroom_set or a winter coat , an easter bonnet , a bicycle for junior - the family set_off for the downtown department_store , where the selection would be greatest . 
department_store congregate in the `` one_hundred percent location '' , where all the transit_line converge . 
these store be still there , but the volume of the `` downtown store '' has be on a relative decline , while in many city the suburban `` branch '' sell more_and_more drygoods . 
if the retailer and hotelman 's downtown unit sale have been decrease , however , his dollar_volume continue to rise , and it is dollar which you put_in the bank . 
in most discussion of this phenomenon , the figure be substantially inflated . 
no suburban shopping_center branch - not even hudson 's vast northland outside detroit - do anything like the unit volume of business or carry anything like the variety of merchandise to be find in the home store . 
telephone_order distort the picture : 
the suburbanite naturally call a local rather_than a central city number if both are list in an advertisement , especially if the local_call eliminate city sales_tax . 
the suburban branch is thereby credit with a sale which would have been make even if its glass door had never open . 
accounting procedure which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branch seem more profitable than they be . 
in many case that statement `` we break_even on our downtown operation and make money on our branch '' would be turn_around if the cost_analysis were recalculate on terms less prejudicial to the old store . 
fear of the competition - always a great motivating force in the american economy - make retailer who do not have suburban operation exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of their rival 's shiny new branch . 
the fact seem to be that very many large branch store be uneconomical , that the choice of location in the suburb be as important as it be downtown , and that even highly suburbanized city will support only so many big branch . 
moreover , the cost of operation be always high in any new store , as the conservative banker who act_as controller for retail giant are begin to discover . 
when all has been say , however , the big branch store remain a major break with history in the development of american retailing . 
just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car , the trip to the shopping_center may seem far easy than to the downtown department_store , though both be the same distance from home . 
indeed , there be some city where the suburban shopping pull customer who be geographically much near to downtown . 
person report that resident of location have been drive across the mississippi , through the heart of downtown st._louis and out to the western suburb for major shopping , simply because parking be easy at the big branch than it be in the heart of town . 
to the extent that the problem be merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of group in columbus , ohio , can fight_back successfully by build a garage on the lot next_door . 
if the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frighten_away from downtown by traffic problem , however , the city store can only pressure the politician to do something about the highway or await the completion of the federal highway program . 
and if the affection for the suburban branch reflect a desire to shop with `` nice people '' , rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which support the downtown department_store , the central location may be in serious trouble . 
today , according_to land economist person , shopping_center and their associated parking_lot cover some 46000 acre of land , which be almost exactly the total land_area in all the nation 's central business_district put together . 
the downtown store continue to offer the great inducement of variety , both within its gate and across the street , where other department_store be immediately convenient for the shopper who want to see what be available before make_up_one's_mind . 
if anything may be predict in the quicksilver world of retailing , it seem likely that the suburban branch will come to dominate child 's clothing ( take the kid downtown be too_much of a production ) , household gadgetry and the discount_business in big-ticket item . 
department_store were build_on drygoods , especially lady ' fashions , and in this area , in_the_long_run , the suburban branch will be hard_put to compete against downtown . 
if this analysis be correct , the suburban branch will turn_out to be what management 's cost_accountant refuse to acknowledge , marginal operation rather_than major factor . 
historically in america the appeal of city has be their color and life , the variety of experience they offer . 
`` how ya gonna keep ' em down on the farm '' ? 
be a question that had to be ask long before they see paree . 
though american usually live in group segregate by national origin or religious_belief , they like to work and shop in the noise and vitality of downtown . 
only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central_city would be likely to destroy this preference - and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change , gloomily foresee by so many urban diagnostician , be actually upon us . 
in their book american_skyline , person and person argue that person 's new_deal be what make the modern suburb a possibility - a fine ironical argument , when you consider how suburbanite tend to vote . 
the first superhighway - new_york 's location and chicago 's location , san_francisco 's location and its approach , a good slice of the location - were build as part of the federal works_program which was going_to cure the depression . 
at_the_same_time , person 's federal_housing_administration , couple with person 's cheap_money policy , permit ordinary lower-middle-class family to build their own home . 
banker who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house itself get that security from the u.s. government ; householder who had been unable to pick_up the burden of short-term high interest mortgage find they could borrow for twenty-five year at 4 percent , under government aegis . 
in the midwest , oxidation pond are use extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban area . 
the high cost of land and a_few operational problem result from excessive loading have create the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristic of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume . 
research at location missouri on oxidation pond has show that the bod in the treated effluent vary from 30 to 53 mg / l with loading from 8 to 120 lb bod / day / acre . 
since experience indicate that effluent from oxidation pond do not create major problem at these bod concentration , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system be the same as from conventional oxidation pond . 
recent study by person and person had indicate that a turbine aerator could be add to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer . 
their study show that it be possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen / hr / hp . 
person and person discuss the use of aerated lagoon for treat organic waste . 
they indicate that a 4 - day retention , aerated lagoon would give 60 to 76 percent bod reduction . 
later , person increase the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 percent in the summer month . 
it appear from the limited information available that the aerated lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increase the capacity of existing oxidation pond as_well as provide the same degree of treatment in a smaller volume . 
with the development of the group south of kansas_city , missouri , the developer was face with the problem of provide adequate sewage_disposal . 
the sewage_system from kansas_city was not expect to serve the location area for several year . 
this necessitate the construction of temporary sewage treatment facility with an expected life from 5 to 15 yr . 
for the initial development an oxidation pond was construct as show in figure 1 . 
the oxidation pond have a surface_area of 4.77 acre and a depth of 4 foot . 
the pond is currently serve 1230 person or 260 person per acre . 
in the summer of 1960 the oxidation pond become completely septic and emit obnoxious odor . 
it be possible to maintain aerobic condition in the pond by regular addition of sodium_nitrate until the temperature decrease and the algae population change from blue-green_algae to green_algae . 
the anaerobic condition in the existing oxidation pond necessitate examination of other method for supply additional oxygen than by sodium_nitrate . 
at_the_same_time further expansion in the group require the construction of additional sewage treatment facility . 
the large land_area require for oxidation pond make this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer . 
it was propose that aerated lagoon be use to eliminate the problem at the existing oxidation pond and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional development . 
the lack of adequate data on the aerated lagoon system prompt the developer to construct an aerated lagoon pilot plant to determine its feasibility for treat domestic sewage . 
the pilot plant be a circular lagoon 81 foot in diam at the surface and 65 foot in diam at the bottom , 4 foot below the surface , with a volume of 121000 gal . 
the side slope were coat with fiberglass matting coat with asphalt to prevent erosion . 
the pilot lagoon was locate as show in figure 1 to serve the area just south of the existing housing area . 
the major contributor be a shopping_center with house being add to the system as the subdivision develop . 
the pilot lagoon was design to handle the waste from 314 person with a 4 - day aeration period . 
initially , the wastewater would be entirely from the shopping_center with the domestic sewage from the house increase over an 18 - month period . 
this operation would permit evaluation of the pilot plant , with a slowly increase load , over a reasonable period_of_time . 
the pilot plant was equip with a 3 - hp turbine aerator ( figure 2 ) . 
the aerator have a variable speed drive to permit operation through a range of speed . 
the sewage flow into the treatment plant was meter and continuously record on 24 - hr chart . 
the raw sewage was introduce directly under the turbine aerator to insure maximum mixing of the raw sewage with the aeration tank content . 
the effluent was collect through two pipe and discharge to the blue_river through a surface drainage_ditch . 
composite sample were collect at weekly interval . 
the long retention period and the complete mixing concept prevent rapid change in either the mixed liquor or in the effluent . 
weekly sample would make any change more readily discernible than daily sample . 
the composite sample were normally collect over a 6 - hr period , but an occasional 24 - hr composite was make . 
examination of the operation of the shopping_center permit correlation of the 6 - hr composite sample with 24 - hr operation . 
the data indicate that the organic load during the 6 - hr composite be essentially 50 percent of the 24 - hr organic load . 
grab_sample were collect from the existing oxidation pond to determine its operating condition . 
efforts were make to take the grab_sample at random period so that the mass of data could be treat as a 6 - hr composite sample . 
a single 24 - hr composite sample indicate that the sewage flow pattern and characteristic be typical . 
the bod of the influent to the pilot plant vary between 110 and 710 mg / l with an average of 350 mg / l . 
this be equivalent_to 240 mg / l bod on a 24 - hr basis . 
the bod of the raw sewage be typical of domestic sewage from a subdivision . 
the bod in the effluent average 58 mg / l , a 76 - percent reduction over the 24 - hr period . 
examination of the data in table 1 , show that a_few sample contribute to raise the effluent bod . 
the period of high effluent bod occur during cold period when operational problem with the aerator result . 
ice cause the aerator to overload , strain the drive belt . 
the slippage of the drive belt cause the aerator to slow_down and reduce oxygen transfer as_well_as the mixing of the raw sewage . 
the organic loading on the unit average 32 lb of bod / day or about 2 lb bod / day 1000 cu_ft aeration capacity . 
needless to say , the organic load be very low on a volumetric basis , but be 270 lb bod / day / acre on a surface loading basis . 
it seem that the aerated lagoon be a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly loaded activated sludge system . 
the flow_rate remain relatively constant during the winter month as show in table 1 , . 
with the spring rain the flow rise rapidly due_to infiltration in open sewer . 
as construction progress , the volume of storm drainage will be sharply reduce . 
the retention period in the aerated lagoon range from 9.8 to 2.6 day , average 6.4 day . 
the large amount of vegetable grinding from the grocery_store in the shopping_center create a suspended solid problem . 
the vegetable were not readily metabolize by the bacteria in the aeration unit and tend to float on the surface . 
a skimming device at the effluent weir prevent loss of most of these light solid . 
the average volatile suspended solid in the effluent be 75 mg / l while mlss average 170 mg / l volatile suspended solid . 
the average sludge age base on displacement of solid was calculate to be 14.5 day . 
the oxygen uptake rate in the mixed liquor average 0.8 mg / l / hr during the first four month of this study . 
variation in aerator speed during the latter two month of this study cause increased mixing and increased oxygen demand . 
the increase in oxygen uptake rate from 1.2 to 2.6 mg / l / hr which follow an increase in rotor speed was believe to be related to resuspension of solid which had settle at the low rotor speed . 
it appear that most of the mixed liquor suspend solid be active microbial solid with the heavy , less active solid settle out . 
the suspended solid discharge in the effluent were find to be the major source of the bod . 
removal of the suspended solid by a membrane filter yield an average effluent contain only 20 mg / l bod . 
the bod in the drainage_ditch receive the pilot plant effluent average 12 mg / l . 
this low bod be_due to removal of the excess suspended solid by sedimentation since the only dilution be surface runoff which be very low during this study . 
routine microscopic examination were make of the mixed liquor as indicate by person and person for the various type of protozoa . 
it was find that the aerated lagoon be an activated sludge system rather_than an oxidation pond . 
at no time were algae find in the mixed liquor . 
the bacteria form typical activated sludge floc . 
the floc particle be all small as the heavy floc settle out . 
initially , the flagellated_protozoan predominate , but they soon give_way to the free-swimming ciliated_protozoan . 
as the temperature decrease , the number of free-swimming ciliated_protozoan decrease . 
very little protozoa activity exist below 40 ` f . 
when the temperature reach 32 ` f all protozoan activity cease ; but as the temperature rise , the number of protozoa increase rapidly . 
only once were stalked ciliate find in the mixed liquor . 
the predomination of free-swimming ciliated_protozoan be indicative_of a high bacterial population . 
one of the important aspect of_this study was to determine the oxygen transfer relationship of the mechanical aerator . 
routine determination were make for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen uptake rate . 
the data give in table 2 , show the routine operation of the aerator . 
the dissolved oxygen in the aeration unit be consistently high until january 29 , 1961 . 
an extended cold_spell cause ice to build_up on the aerator which was mount on a floating platform and cause the entire platform to sink low in the water . 
the added resistance to the rotor damage the drive belt and reduce the oxygen transfer capacity . 
it be approximately one month before the belt problem was notice and correct , but at no time be there a deficiency of dissolved oxygen . 
a series of eight special test were conduct at different rotor speed to determine the oxygen transfer rate . 
five of the test were conduct with a polyethylene cover to simulate an ice cover . 
the rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 - mg / l dissolved oxygen concentration and 10 ` c for various rotor speed is give in table 3 , . 
the maximum rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 mg / l dissolved oxygen was calculate as 220 lb / day at a maximum rate of 9.3 mg / l / hr . 
the actual power requirement indicate 2 lb oxygen transfer / hr / hp . 
the polyethylene cover reduce the oxygen transfer rate by 10 percent , indicate that the maximum oxygen transfer be at the rotor rather_than through the surface . 
during this study septic condition develop in the oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melt . 
shortly after this study end septic condition result which require the addition of sodium_nitrate . 
the location of the oxidation pond in a high value residential area make odor nuisance a sensitive problem for the developer . 
the organic concentration in the influent raw sewage range from 160 to 270 mg / l of bod with an average of 230 mg / l . 
the bod data are give in table 4 , . 
a single 24 - hr composite sample have a bod of 260 mg / l , indicate a typical domestic sewage . 
the daily sewage volume to the oxidation pond average 147000 gpd , give a retention period of 42 day . 
the organic loading on the pond be slightly under 60 lb bod / day / acre . 
the effluent bod average 34 mg / l , a_little low than that of the study at location indicate for a loading of 60 lb bod / day / acre . 
the bod of the effluent range from a minimum of 13 to a maximum of 47 mg / l . 
microscopic examination of the effluent show that minimum bod occur when the algae begin to decrease with cold_weather . 
when the algae begin to build_up again , the effluent bod rise . 
during the two_weeks when the algae disappear from the effluent bod 's in the effluent be 18 and 16 mg / l . 
person did not go_back to school . 
his parent talk seriously and lengthily to their own doctor and to a specialist at the group - person be entitled to a discount for member of his family - and it was decide it would be best for him to take_off the remainder of the term off , spend a_lot of time in bed and , for the rest , do pretty_much as he choose - provided , of_course , he choose to do nothing too exciting or too debilitating . 
his teacher and his school_principal were confer_with and everyone agree that , if he keep_up with a certain amount of work at home , there be little danger of his lose a term . 
person accept the decision with indifference and did not enter the argument . 
he was discharge from the hospital after a two day checkup and he and his parent have what person describe as a `` celebration lunch '' at the cafeteria on the campus . 
person wear a smart hat and , because she had been warn recently about smoking , puff at her cigarette through a long ivory holder stained with lipstick . 
person 's father sit sprawled in his chair , angular , alert as a cricket , look about at the huge stainless_steel appointment of the room with an expression of proprietorship . 
teacher - man who wear brown suit and have gray hair and pleasant smile - come to their table to talk_shop and to be introduce to person and person . 
person be polite , person indifferent . 
they eat the cafeteria food with its orange sauce and person gaze without interest at his food , the teacher , the heroic baronial window , and the bright rank of college banner . 
his father try to make the food a topic . 
`` the blueberry_pie be good , person . 
i recommend it '' . 
he look at his son , his face worried . 
person murmur , `` no , thanks '' , so softly his father had_to bend his gaunt height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him . 
person regard the ear and the grizzled hair around it with a moment of interest . 
he say more loudly , `` i'm full , old pop '' . 
he had eat almost nothing on the crested , three sectioned plate and had drink about half the milk in its paper container . 
`` he's all_right , person '' , person say . 
`` i can fix him something later in the afternoon when we get home '' . 
since his seizure , person had have little appetite ; yet his changed appearance , surprisingly , be one of plumpness . 
his face be full ; his lip and the usually sharp line of his jaw had become swollen look . 
he breathe now with his mouth open , show a whitely curving section of lower tooth ; he keep his eye , with their puffed blurred lid , always lowered , though not , apparently , focusing . 
even his neck seem thick and therefore short . 
his hand , which had be as quick as a pair of fluttering bird , be now neither active nor really relaxed . 
they lie on his lap , palm up , stiffly motionless , the tapered finger a_little thick at the joint . 
altogether he have , since the seizure , the appearance of a boy who overindulge in food and take no exercise . 
he look lazy , spoiled , a_little querulous . 
person have little to say . 
she greet her husband 's colleague with smiling politeness , offer nothing . 
person , for all his sprawling and his easy familiarity , be completely alert to his son , eye always on the still face , jump to anticipate person desire . 
it be a strained , silent lunch . 
person say , `` i 'd_better get him to bed '' . 
the doctor had suggest person remain most of every afternoon in bed until he be strong . 
since person had to give a lecture , person and person drive home alone in the plymouth . 
they did not speak much . 
person gaze out at ugly gray slum and say softly , `` look at those stupid kid '' . 
it be a negro section of peeling row_house , storefront church and ragged child . 
person had to bend toward person and ask him to repeat . 
he say , `` nothing '' . 
and_then : `` there be lots of kid around here '' . 
person look at the child , his mouth slightly opened , his eye dull . 
he feel tired and full and calm . 
the day seem short , perhaps because his routine be , each_day , almost the same . 
he rise late and go_down in his bathrobe and slipper to have breakfast either alone or with person . 
person treat him with_attention and try to tempt his appetite with special food : biscuit , cookie , candy - the result of devoted hour in the tiled kitchen . 
she would hover over him and , look_like her brother , anxiously watch the progress of person 's fork or spoon . 
`` you do n't eat enough , honey . 
try to get_down that down '' . 
person , observe , would say , `` he has_to rediscover his own capacity . 
it 'll take time '' . 
person and person talk to each other quietly now , as ally who be political rather_than natural might in a war atmosphere . 
both watch person constantly , person without seem to , person openly , her eye fill with concern . 
person be neutral . 
he did not resent their supervision or person 's sometimes tiring sympathy . 
he eat what he feel_like , sleep as much or as little as he please , and move about the draughty room of the house , when he be not in bed , with slow dubious step , like an elderly tourist in a cathedral . 
his energy be go . 
he be able , now , to sit for hour in a chair in the living_room and stare out at the bleak yard without move . 
his hand lie loosely , yet stiffly - they be like wax hand : almost lifelike , not quite - fold in his lap ; his mouth hang slightly open . 
when he was ask a question or address in such a way that some response be inescapable , he would answer ; if , as often happen , he had to repeat because he had speak too softly , he would repeat his word in the same way , without emphasis or impatience , only a_little loud . 
he had not mention person . 
he had not even think_about her much except once or twice at night in bed when his slowly ranging thought would abruptly , almost accidentally , encounter her . 
at these time he feel a kind of pain in his upper chest , but it be an objective pain , in_no_way different from others in intensity and not different in kind ; it be like the bandaged wound on the back of his head which occasionally throb ; it be merely another part of his weakness . 
he be calm , drugged , and lazy . 
he did not care . 
person mention person . 
she say , `` i notice the girl from across the street has n't bother to phone or visit '' . 
person say , `` that 's all_right . 
person 's all_right '' . 
he think_about it briefly , then deliberately turn the talk to something else . 
once , sit at the front window in his parent ' room , he see person come_out of her house . 
she be with person . 
they be far off and look tiny . 
the heavy branch in his front_yard would hide and then reveal them . 
they turn at the bottom of person 's steps and move off in the direction of the park . 
he think he see - it awaken and , for a moment , interest him - that person hold a leash in her hand and that a round fuzzy puppy be on the end of the leash . 
then they disappear and person get_up and go_into his own room and get_into_bed . 
by the time he be under the cover he had forget about see person . 
the doctor , since person be no_longer allow to make his regular trip into town to see him , come often and informally to the house . 
he would sit , slim-waisted and spare , on the edge of person 's bed , his leg cross so elaborately that the crossed foot could tap the floor . 
person did not mind the doctor 's unsmiling teasing as he used_to . 
`` husky young_man '' , he say with mock distaste . 
`` i imagine you 're always battle in school '' . 
`` i do n't go_to school anymore '' . 
`` pardon '' ? 
the doctor had to bend close to hear ; his delicate hand , as veined as a moth 's wing , rest absently on person 's chest . 
person say the same word more loudly . 
`` oh . 
well , we 're taking a little vacation , that 's all '' . 
he turn unsmilingly to person . 
`` i think by the end of next week he could get_out in the air a_little . 
he could now but the weakness be very definite ; it would exhaust him further and unnecessarily . 
he 'll be strong soon '' . 
his stethoscope be on the table by person 's bed and he pick_up it up and wag it at person . 
he say fussily , `` just keep the cap on those strong emotion '' . 
the stethoscope glint silver in the darken room . 
`` i 'll drop_by again in a_few day '' . 
person stay_on after the doctor had go . 
she smooth the cover on person 's bed and pick_up thing up from the floor . 
she did not touch him . 
person watch with disinterest . 
he did not speak . 
he have no desire to . 
she say , `` do you think you 'll miss school '' ? 
he had notice how formal and irritably exact person had grow . 
he did not care . 
he feel her irritability did not concern him , yet he know he would not care even if it did . 
he shake his head . 
`` we 've had any number of call about you . 
you could win a popularity_contest at that school without any trouble . 
person call twice . 
she want to pay you a visit . 
she say the child miss you . 
apparently you be the light of their life '' . 
person shrug slightly . 
person come close to the bed , bend as if she would kiss him , then move away . 
she was frown . 
`` that doctor annoy me '' . 
she seem to speak_to herself . 
`` do you suppose his self-consciousness be characteristic of the new negro professional or merely of doctor in_general '' ? 
she turn_to him again . 
`` well , person sally - has phone too . 
she be very worried '' . 
person 's tone be dry . 
`` she did n't really say '' - she glance away at the floor , then swoop gracefully and pick_up one of person 's slipper . 
`` i mean , do you feel_like see person '' ? 
person say , `` i do n't know '' . 
it be true . 
he did not . 
there be the slight pain , but it be no different from the throbbing in his head . 
`` well , there 's time , in_any_case . 
we 'll wait till you 're strong and then talk_about it '' . 
she put the slipper neatly by its mate at the foot of the bed . 
person say , `` okay '' . 
this time person kiss him lightly on the forehead . 
person be pleased . 
his father be a constant visitor . 
person would hear the front_door in the evening and then his father 's deep slow voice ; it float up the stairs . 
`` how 's person '' ? 
and person 's or person 's reply : `` better . 
he 's get plenty of rest '' . 
`` be his appetite improved '' ? 
or : `` does he get exercise '' ? 
the exchange be almost invariable , and person , in his bed , could hear every word of_it . 
he never smile . 
it require an energy he no_longer possess to be satirical about his father . 
his father would come upstairs and stand self-consciously at the foot of the bed and look_at his son . 
after a pause , during which he study person 's face as if person be not there and could not study him too , person would ask the same question he had ask downstairs . 
person would reply softly and his father , apologetically , would ask him to repeat . 
`` i'm eating more '' , he would say . 
or : `` i walk_around the house a_lot '' . 
`` perhaps you should get_out a_little '' . 
`` i'm not suppose to yet '' . 
he be not irritate . 
he did not mind the useless , kindly question . 
he look at the lined face with vague interest ; he feel he was note it , as if it be something he might think_about when he grow strong . 
person examine everything with critical care , seek something material to blame for his son 's illness . 
`` have you get enough blanket '' ? 
and another time , without accusation : `` you never wear that scarf i buy you '' . 
where their sharp edge seem restless as sea wave thrust themselves upward in angry motion , person sit glacier like , his smooth solidity , his very immobility defy all the turmoil about him . 
`` our objective '' , the colonel had say that day of the briefing , `` be person '' . 
there the objective sit , brood over all . 
gouge , burn , blast , insult it as they would , could anyone really take person ? 
between the ponderous hulk and himself , in the valley over which person reign , man had hide high_explosive , booby_trap , and mine . 
the raped valley be a pregnant womb await abortion . 
on the forward slope in_front_of his own post stretch two row of barbed_wire . 
at the slope 's base coil of concertina stretch out_of eye range like a wild tangle of child 's hoop , stop simultaneously , weirdly poised as if await the magic of the child 's touch to start them all roll again . 
close still , regular barricade of barbed_wire hang on timber support . 
be it all vain labor ? 
who would clean_up the mess when the war be over ? 
smile at his quixotic thought , person turn_back from the opening and light a cigarette before sit_down . 
tonight a group of man , tomorrow night he himself , would go_out there somewhere and wait . 
if he were to go with person , he would be out there two day , not just listen in the dark at some point between here and person , but move ever deep into enemy land - behind person itself . 
be this what he had expect ? 
he had n't realize that there would be so much time to think , so many lull . 
somehow he had forget what he must have been tell , that combat be an intermittent activity . 
now he know that the moment illuminate by the vision on the train would have_to be approach . 
it could take_place tomorrow night , or it might occur month from now . 
there be just too much time . 
time to become afraid . 
person 's suggestion flatter , but he did not like the identity . 
he did not spill_over with hatred for the enemy . 
he had n't even see him yet . 
press_out his cigarette out in the earth , person walk to the slit and scan the jagged hills . 
he see no life , but still stand there for a time peer at the unlovely hills , his gaze continually return to person . 
he had come here in_order to test himself . 
while most of his belief be still unsettled , he know that he did not believe_in killing . 
yet , he be here . 
he had come because he could not live_out his life feel that he had be a coward . 
there be ten man on the patrol which person lead out that next night . 
the beaming rok was carry a thirty caliber machine_gun ; another man lug the tripod and a box of ammunition . 
person and person each carry , in_addition to their own weapon and ammo , a box of ammo for the rok 's machine_gun . 
others carry extra clip for the browning_automatic_rifle , which be in the hands of a little mexican name person . 
person had brief the two new man that afternoon . 
`` we just sit quiet and wait '' , person had say . 
`` be sure the man near you be awake . 
if person does n't show_up , we 'll all be back here at 0600 hour . 
otherwise , we hold a reception . 
then we pull_out under our mortar and artillery cover , but nobody pull_out until i say so . 
remember what i say about go_out to get anybody leave behind ? 
that still hold . 
we bring_back all dead and wounded '' . 
at 2130 hour they had pass_through the barbed_wire at the point of departure . 
then begin the journey through their own mine_field . 
mine . 
ours be kind than theirs , some say . 
they set bouncing_betty to jump and explode at testicle level while we more mercifully have them go_off at the head . 
mine . 
big ones and little . 
the crude wooden box of the enemy , our nicely turn gray metal disk . 
but theirs defy the detector . 
mine . 
a foot misplaced , a leg missing . 
mine . 
all size : big ones , some wire to set_off a whole field , little ones , hand_grenade size . 
booby_trap to fill the head with chunk of metal . 
person try to shake_off the jumble of his fear by looking_at the sky . 
it be dark . 
person had say that the searchlight would be bounce off the cloud at 2230 hour , `` which give us time to get settle in position '' . 
because they be new man and to be sure that they did n't get lost , person had place person and person in the center of the patrol as it file_out . 
his eye now fixed on person 's solid figure , person could hear behind him the tread of another . 
he could also hear the stream which he had see from his position . 
they were going to follow it for part of their journey . 
`` it 's safe '' , person had say , `` and it provide cover for our noise '' . 
soon they were pick their way along the edge of the stream which glow in the night . 
on their right rise the embankment cover with brush and tree . 
if a branch extend out too far , each man hold it back for the next , and if they meet a low overhang , each warn the other . 
thus , stealthily they advance upstream ; then they turn to the right , climb the embankment , and walk into the valley again . 
there was no cover here , only grass sighing against pant_leg . 
and with each sigh , like a whip in the hand of an expert , the grass strip something from person . 
the gentle whir of each footstep leave him more naked than before , until he feel his unprotected flesh tremble , chill by each new sound . 
the shape of the man ahead of him lack solidity , as if the whip had strip them of their very flesh . 
the dark form move like mourner on some nocturnal pilgrimage , their dirge unsung for want of vocal_cord . 
the warped , broken tree in the valley assume wraithlike shape . 
clump of brush that they pass be so many enchained demon strain in anger to tear and gnaw on his bone . 
loom over all , person leer down at him , threaten a_hundred hidden malevolency . 
off in the distance a searchlight flash on , its beam slash the sky . 
the sharp ray was absorb by a cloud , then reflect to the earth in a soft , diffused radiance . 
somewhere over there another patrol have need of light . 
person think_of all the man out that night who , like himself , had leave their protective ridge and - fear work at their guts - pick their way into the area beyond . 
from the east to the west coast of the location be a strip of land in which fear filled man were at that same moment furtively crawl through the night , sit in sweaty anticipation of any movement or sound , or shout amidst confused rifle flash and muzzle blast . 
person 's arm go_up and person raise his own . 
the patrol was stop . 
person come_up `` take that spot over there '' , he whisper , point to a small clump of blackness . 
`` give me your machine_gun ammo '' . 
person hand him the metal box and person quietly disappear down the line . 
lie in the grass behind the brush clump , person look about . 
the others likewise had hide themselves in the grass and the brush . 
over his shoulder he could see person with the machine_gun crew . 
even at this short distance they be only vague shape , set_up the machine_gun on a small knoll so that it could fire above the head of the rest of the patrol . 
person ease his rifle 's safety off and gently , slowly sneak another clip of ammunition from one of the cloth bandoleer that mark the upper part of his body with an x . 
this he place within quick reach . 
the walk and his fear had serve to overheat him and his sweaty armpit cool at the touch of the night air . 
although the armored vest fit the upper part of his body snugly , he feel no security . 
figure seem to crouch in the surrounding dark ; in the distance he see a band of man who seem to advance and retreat even as he watch . 
certain this menace be only imaginary , he yet stare in fascinated horror , his hand sticky against the stock of his weapon . 
he be aware of insistent inner beating , as if prisoner within seek release from his rigid body . 
above , the glowing ivory baton of their searchlight point at the cloud , dilute the valley 's dark to a pallid light . 
then the figure which hold his attention become a group of shattered tree , stand like the grotesque of a medieval damnation scene . 
even_so , he could not ease the tension of his body ; the rough surface of the earth itself seem to resist every attempt on his part to relax . 
sense the unseen presence of the other man in the patrol , he feel mutely united to these nine near stranger share this pinpoint of being with him . 
he sense something precious in the perilous moment , something akin to the knowledge gain on his bicycle trip through the french countryside , a knowledge imprison in speechlessness . 
in location he had puzzle the meaning of the great stone monument man had throw up to the sky , and always as he wander , he feel a stranger to their exultation . 
they be poem in a strange language , of which he could barely touch a meaning - enough to make his being ache with the desire for the fullness he sense there . 
location , that stone-gray mystery through which he travel for thirty day , sleep in the barn of farmer or alongside road , had work some subtle change in him , he know , and it was in location that he had meet person . 
person have no hand ; they had been sever at the wrist . 
with leather cup fit in his handlebar , he steer his bicycle . 
he and person had travel together for four day . 
they visit the shipyard at location and person had_to sign the register , vouch for the integrity of the visiting foreigner . 
he take the pen in his stump and begin to write . 
`` wait ! 
wait '' ! cry the guard who run from the hut to shout to other man stand about outside . 
they crowd the small room and peer over one another 's shoulder to watch the handless man write his name in the book . 
`` c'est formidable '' , they exclaim . 
`` mais , oui . 
c'est merveilleux '' . 
and_then the question come , eager , interested question , and many compliment on his having overcome his infirmity . 
`` does n't it ever bother you '' , person had ask , `` to have people always ask you about your hand '' ? 
`` oh , the_french be a very curious people '' , person had laugh . 
`` they be also honest seeker after truth . 
now person be painfully silent about my missing hand . 
they refuse to mention or to notice that they be not there . 
the person , like yourself , take the fact for granted , try to be helpful , but do n't ask question . 
i'm used_to all three , but i think the_french have the healthy attitude '' . 
that be the day that person had tell person about the group . 
`` you are look tired and there you can rest . 
it will be good_for_you . 
i think , too '' , he say , his dark eye mischievous , `` that you will find there some clue to the secret of the cathedral about which you have speak '' . 
within two_weeks person was ring the bell at the abbey gate . 
the monk who open the door immediately calm his worry about his reception : `` i speak english '' , the old_man say , `` but i do not hear it very_well '' . 
he smile and stick a large finger with white hair sprout on_it into his ear as though that might help . 
smile at person 's protestation , the old monk take his grip from him and lead him down a corridor to a small parlor . 
`` will you please wait in here . 
person sit over his second whisky_on_the_rocks in a little bar next to the funeral_parlor on location . 
group be small , dark , narrow , and filled with the mingle scent of beer , tobacco smoke , and italian cooking . 
hang over the bar was an oil_painting of a nude person had accept from a student at the group who needed to eat and drink and be broke . 
the nude be small and black-haired and elfin , and be called `` person '' . 
this be one place where person could go for a drink in a back booth without anyone notice him , or at_least come_up and hang_around and want to know all the low-down . 
the other patron be taxidriver and art_student and small shopkeeper . 
the reporter had not_yet discover that this be his hideaway . 
his friend person be with him . 
she be wise enough to realize a man could be good company even if he did weigh too_much and did n't own the mint . 
she be the widow of a writer who had die in an airplane crash , and person had find her a job as head of the historical section of the group . 
this mean sort_out press_clipping and the_like . 
person sit receptive and interested . 
person have a pleasant glow as he say , `` you see , both of them , i mean the president and person , be romantic . 
a romantic be one who think the world is divinely inspire and all he has_to do be find the right key , and then divine justice and altruism will appear . 
it 's like focus a camera ; the distant ship be n't there until you get the focus . 
you know what i'm talk_about . 
i'm sure all girl feel this way about man until they live with them . 
`` but when it come_to war , the colonel know what it be and person does n't . 
person know that a soldier will get the distinguished_service_medal for conduct that would land him in prison for life or the electric_chair as a civilian . 
he have a mean , unbroken sheer bastard in his outfit , and someone invent the name person for him . 
that 's to say , he be trigger-happy . 
he 'd shoot at anything if it be the rear_end of a horse or his own sentry . 
he be a wiry , inscrutable , silent country boy from the red_clay of rural alabama , and he speak with the broad drawl that others normally make_fun of . 
but not in_front_of person . 
i hear of some that try it back in the location , and he 'd knock them clear across the room . 
there 'd be a pretty bad incident back at the marine base . 
a new_york kid , a refugee from one of the harlem gang , make_fun of person 's accent , and draw a knife . 
before the fight be over , the harlem boy have a concussion and person was cut_up badly . 
they catch person steal liquor from the officer ' mess , and he get a_couple_of girl in_trouble . 
the fear of punishment just did n't bother him . 
it be n't there . 
it was leave_out of him at_birth . 
this be why he make such a magnificent soldier . 
he was n't trouble with the ordinary , rank_and_file fear that overcome and paralyze and send individual soldier and whole company under_fire run in panic . 
it just did n't occur to person that anything serious would happen to him . 
do you get_the_picture of the kind of fellow he be '' ? 
person nod with a pleasant smile . 
`` all_right . 
there be a sniper 's nest in a mountain cave , and it was pick_off our man with devilish accuracy . 
the colonel order that it be wipe_out , and i suggest , ' you ask for volunteer , and promise each man on the patrol a quart of whisky , ten dollar and a weekend pass to location ' . 
person be one of the five volunteer . 
the patrol snake around in back of the cave , approach it from above and drop in suddenly with wild howl . 
you could hear them from our outpost . 
there be a_lot of shooting . 
we know the enemy was subdue , because a flare was fire as the signal . 
so we hurry over . 
two of our man were kill , a third was wound . 
person and a very black colored boy from detroit had kill or put out_of action ten guerrilla by grenade and hand-to-hand fighting . 
when we get there , person and the negro were quarrel over possession of a gold crucifix around the neck of a wounded filipino . 
the colored boy have it , and person lunge at him with a knife and say , ' give that to me , you black bastard . 
we do n't ' low nigra to walk on the same sidewalk with white_man where i come from ' . 
`` the negro get a bad slice on his chest from the knife wound '' . 
`` what did the colonel do about the man '' ? 
person ask in her placid , interested way . 
person laugh . 
`` he recommend both of them for the dsm and the detroit fellow for the purple_heart , too , for a combat inflict wound . 
so you see person know what it 's all about . 
but not person . 
when he be in the war , he be in law or supplies or something like that , and an old buddy of his tell me he would come down on sunday to the pentagon and read the citation for medal - just like the one we send_in for person - and go_away with a real glow . 
these be hero nine foot tall to him '' . 
person be alone at the small , perfectly appointed table by the window look_out_over the river . 
he have dinner and sit there over his coffee watch the winding pattern of traffic as it cross the bridge and spread_out like a serpent with two head . 
open beside him be person . 
he think how this dainty , fragile older woman thread her way through the street of location on a day in june , enjoy the flower in the shop , the greeting from old friend , but never really draw a deep , passionate breath , be so like himself . 
he , and person , too , had never permit themselves the luxury of joy that dig_into the bone_marrow of the spirit . 
he had not because he be both poor and ambitious . 
poverty impose a kind of chastity on the ambitious . 
they cannot stop to grasp and embrace and sit in the back seat of car along a dark country lane . 
no , they must look_the_other_way and climb one more painful step up the ladder . 
he make the decision with his eye open , or so he think . 
at any cost , he must leave the dreary pennsylvania mining town where his father be a pharmacist . 
and so he had , so he had . 
at group , he have no time to walk among the violet on the water 's edge . 
from his room he could look out in springtime and see the couple hand_in_hand walk slowly , deliciously , across the campus , and he could smell the sweet vernal wind . 
he be not stone . 
he be not unmoved . 
he had to teach himself patiently that these trap be not for him . 
he must mentally pull the blind and close the window , so that all that exist be in the book before him . 
at law_school , the same . 
more of this stamp_down of human emotion as a young lawyer in new_york . 
by the time he be prosperous enough - his goal be high - he be bald and afraid of woman . 
the only one who would have him be his cripple , the strange unhappy woman who become his wife . 
perhaps it be right ; perhaps it be just . 
he had dared to defy nature , to turn his back to the lorelei , and he was punish . 
like person , with her regret about person , he have his moment of melancholy over a youth too well spend . 
if he had have a son , he would tell him , `` gather ye rosebud while ye may . 
this same flower that smile today tomorrow will be die '' . 
but then his son could afford it . 
person was wait for person . 
the vice_president had call and ask if he could see the secretary at his home . 
he say the matter be urgent . 
the secretary be uneasy about the visit . 
he did not like person . 
he suspect something underhanded and furtive about him . 
person could not put his finger on_it precisely , and this worry him . 
when you dislike or distrust a man , you should have a reason . 
human nature be not a piece of meat you could tell be bad by its smell . 
person stare a minute at the lighted ribbon of traffic , hope that a clue to his dislike of the vice_president would appear . 
it did not . 
therefore , he decide he be unfair to the young_man and should make an effort to understand and sympathize with his point_of_view . 
a half-hour later the vice_president arrive . 
he look_at very carefully at every piece of furnishings , as though hope to store this information carefully in his mind . 
he observe the florentine vase in the hall , the person painting in the library , as_well_as the long shelf of well-bound volume ; the pattern of the oriental rug , the delicate cut_glass chandelier . 
he say to the secretary , `` i understand you come from a little pennsylvania town near location . 
how do you find_out about this '' ? 
he wave his arm around at the furnishings . 
it be not a discourteous question , person decide . 
this young_man have so little time to learn he had to be curious ; he had to find_out . 
the secretary do not tell him at what cost , at what loneliness , he learn these thing . 
he merely say , `` any good decorator these day can make you a tasteful home '' . 
the vice_president say , `` if you hear of any name that would fix_me_cheap in_return_for advertising they decorate the vice_president 's home , let me know . 
i can do business with that kind '' . 
again , person think a_little sadly , these be the fee of poverty and ambition . 
person did not have the chance to grow_up graciously . 
he had to acquire everything he was going_to get in four year . 
they have brandy in the library . 
person look at person with a searching glance , the kind that a prosecuting_attorney would give a man on trial . 
what be your weakness ? 
where will you break ? 
how best to destroy your peace ? 
the vice_president say with a slight bluster , `` there be n't anyone who love the president more_than i do . 
person be my ideal . 
at_the_same_time , you have_to face fact and realize that a man who 's be in the marine_corps all his life does n't understand much about politics . 
what does a monk know about sex '' ? 
person listen with the practiced , deceptive calm of the lawyer , but his face be in the shadow . 
`` so , we have_to protect the old_man for his own good . 
you see what i mean . 
group be full of politician , and if you want to get_along_with them , you have_to be politic . 
this be why i say we just can't go_ahead and disarm the german and pull_down our own defense . 
let me tell you what happen to me today . 
a fellow come_up_to me , a person , i do n't have_to tell you his name , and he tell me , ' i love the president like a brother , but god_damn_it , he 's crucify me . 
i 've have_got a quarter of a_million german in my state , and those krauthead tune_in on person every_night , and if he tell them to go_out and piss in the public_square , that 's what they do . 
he 's tell them now to write letter to their congressman oppose the disarmament of germany ' . 
and another one come to me and he say , ' look_here , there 's a mill in my state employ five thousand people make uniform for the navy . 
the bishop look at him coldly and say `` take it or leave it '' ! 
literally , there be nothing else to do . 
he was catch in a machine . 
but person was not easily excite or upset and say quite calmly : `` let 's go and see what it_'s like '' . 
location be about seventy-five mile west of location , near the location border and on the location , a small and dirty stream . 
the city be a center of manufacture , especially in textile , and also because of the beauty of some of its surroundings , a residence for many owner of the great industry in north location . 
but it have , as be usual in southern city of this sort , a location , a low region near the river where the person live - servant and laborer huddle_together in a region with no sewage save the river , where street and sidewalk be neglected and where there be much poverty and crime . 
person come by train from location and look the city over ; the rather pleasant white city be on the hill where the chief store be . 
beyond be industry and factory . 
then they go_down to location . 
in_the_midst of this crowded region be the group . 
it be an old and dirty wooden structure , sadly in need of repair . 
but it be a landmark . 
it had be there 50 year or more and everybody in town , black and white , know of it . 
it had just suffer a calamity , the final crisis in a long series of calamity . 
for the old preacher who had be there twenty-five year be dead , and the city mourn him . 
he be a loud-voiced man , once vigorous but for many year now decline in strength and ability . 
he be stern and overbearing with his flock , but obsequious and conciliatory with the white , especially the rich who partly support the church . 
the group , head by a black_man name person , had practically take_over as the pastor grow old , and had_its_way with the support of the amen_corner . 
the characteristic thing about this church be its amen_corner and the weekly religious orgy . 
a knot of old worshipper , chiefly woman , listen weekly to a sermon . 
it begin invariably in low tone , almost conversational , and then gradually work_up to high , shrill appeal to god and man . 
and_then the amen_corner take_hold , reenact a form of group_participation in worship that stem from year before the greek_chorus , spread down through the african forest , overseas to the location , and then here in location . 
with shout and slow dance , with tears and song , with scream and contortion , the corner group was beset by hysteria and shiver , wailing , shout , possession of something that seem like an alien and outside force . 
it spread to most of the audience and was often view by visit white who snicker behind handkerchief and afterward discuss negro religion . 
it sometimes end in deathlike trance with many lie exhausted and pant on chair and floor . 
to most of those who compose the amen_corner it be a magnificent and beautiful experience , something for which they live from week to week . 
it was often reenact in less wild form at the wednesday night prayer_meeting . 
person , on his first sunday , witness this with something like disgust . 
he had preach a short sermon , try to talk man-to-man to the audience , to tell them who he be , what he had done in location and birmingham , and what he propose to do here . 
he sympathize_with them on the loss of their old pastor . 
but then , at mention of that name , the amen_corner break_loose . 
he have no chance to say another word . 
at the very end , when the audience be silent and breathless , a collection was take and then slowly everyone file_out . 
the audience did not think much of the new pastor , and what the new pastor think_of the audience he did not dare at the time to say . 
during the next week he look over the situation . 
first_of_all there be the parsonage , an utterly impossible place for civilized people to live_in , originally poorly conceive , apparently not repair for year , with no plumbing or sewage , with rathole and rot . 
it was arrange that he would board in the home of one of the old member of the church , a woman name person who , as person afterward find , was briefly refer to as person because of her sharp_tongue and fierce initiative . 
person be a lonely , devoted soul , never marry , conduct a spotless home and devoted to her church , but a perpetual dissenter and born critic . 
she soar over the new pastor like an avenging angel lest he stray from the path and not know all the truth and gossip of which she be chief repository . 
then person look over the church and study its condition . 
the salary of the pastor had for year be $ 500 annually and even this be in_arrears . 
person make_up_one's_mind that he must receive at_least $ 2500 , but when he mention this to the deacon they say nothing . 
the church itself must be repair . 
it be dirty and neglected . 
it really ought to be rebuilt , and he determine to go_up and talk to the city bank about this . 
meanwhile , the city itself should be talk to . 
the street in the colored section be dirty . 
there be typhoid and malaria . 
the child have nowhere to go and no place to play , not even sidewalk . 
the school be small , dark and ill-equipped . 
the teacher be a pliant fool . 
there be two liquor saloon not very far from the church , one white , that_is conduct for white people with a side_entrance for person ; the other exclusively person . 
undoubtedly , there be a good_deal of gambling in both . 
on the other side of the church be a quiet , well-kept house with shutter and recently paint . 
person inquire about it . 
it be called location . 
the deacon of the church , person , be its janitor . 
one of the leading member of the amen_corner be cook ; there be two or three colored maid employ there . 
person was tell that it be a sort of hotel for white people , which seem to him rather queer . 
why should a white hotel be set_down in the center of location ? 
but nevertheless it look respectable . 
he be glad to have it there . 
the rest of location be a rabbit_warren of home in every condition of neglect , disrepair and careful upkeep . 
dive , carefully repaired hut , and nicely painted and ornamented cottage were jumbled together cheek_by_jowl with little distinction . 
the best could not escape_from the worst and the worst nestle cosily beside the better . 
the yard , front and back , be narrow ; some be trash_dump , some have flower_garden . 
behind be privy , for there be no sewage_system . 
after look about a_bit , person discover beyond location , across the river and far removed from the white city , a considerable tract of land , and it occur to him that the church and the better person home might gradually be move to this plot . 
he talk_about it to the person . 
the person look him over rather carefully . 
he be not sure what kind of a man he have in_hand . 
but there be one thing that he had_to stress , and that be that the contribution to the general church expense , the dollar money , had been seriously fall_behind in this church , and that must be look_after immediately . 
in_fact , he intimate clearly that that be the reason that person had been send here - to make a larger contribution of dollar money . 
person stress the fact that clear as this be , they must have a better church , a more businesslike conduct of the church organization , and an effort to get_out this religious center out_of its rut of wild worship into a modern church organization . 
he emphasize to the person the plan of giving_up the old church and move across the river . 
the person be sure that that would be impossible . 
but he tell person to `` go_ahead and try '' . 
and person try . 
it did seem impossible . 
the bank which hold the mortgage on the old church declare that the interest be considerably in_arrears , and the real_estate people say flatly that the land across the river was being hold for an eventual development for white working people who were come_in , and that none would be sell to colored folk . 
when it was propose to rebuild the church , person find that the terms for a new mortgage be very high . 
he be sure that he could do better if he go_to location to get the deal finance . 
but when this proposal was make to his group , he meet unanimous opposition . 
the church certainly would not be remove . 
the very proposition be sacrilege . 
it had be here fifty year . 
it was going_to stay forever . 
it be hardly possible to get any argument on the subject . 
as for rebuilding , well , that might be look_into , but there be no hurry , no hurry at_all . 
person again go downtown to a different banker , an intelligent young white_man who seem rather sympathetic , but he shake his head . 
`` person '' , he say , `` i think you do n't quite understand the situation here . 
do n't you see the amount_of_money that has been invest by white around that church ? 
tenement , store , saloon , some gambling , i hope not too_much . 
the colored people are get employment at group and other place , and they be near their place of employment . 
when a city has arrange thing like this you cannot easily change them . 
now , if i be you i would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or ten year . 
by that time , perhaps something better can be do '' . 
then person ask , `` what about this group which you mention ? 
i do n't understand why a white hotel should be down here '' . 
the young banker look at him with a certain surprise , and then he say flatly : `` i'm afraid i can't tell you anything in_particular about location . 
you 'll have_to find_out about it on your own . 
hope to see you again '' . 
and he dismiss the colored pastor . 
it was next day that person come and sit beside him and take his hand . 
she say , `` my dear , do you know what location be '' ? 
`` no '' , say person , `` i do n't . 
i was just ask about it . 
what be it '' ? 
`` it_'s a house_of_prostitution for white_man with white girl as inmate . 
they hire a good_deal of local labor , include two member of our group . 
they buy some supplies from our colored grocer and they are patronize by some of the best white gentleman in town '' . 
person stare at her . 
`` my dear , you must be mistaken '' . 
`` talk to person '' , she say . 
and after person had talk to person and to others , he be absolutely amazed . 
this , of_course , be the sort of thing that used_to take_place in southern city - put white house_of_prostitution colored girl in colored neighborhood and carry_on them on openly . 
but it had largely disappear on_account_of protest by the white and through growing resentment on_the_part_of the person as they become more educated and get better wage . 
but this situation of group be more subtle . 
the wage involve be larger and more regular . 
the inmate be white and from out of town , avoid local friction . 
the backing from the white town be great and there be little publicity . 
good wage , patronage and subscription of various kind stop open protest from person . 
and yet person know that this place must go or he must go . 
and for him to leave this job now without accomplish anything would mean practically the end of his career in the methodist_church , if not in all church . 
person dismount in location and hand the rein to location . 
there be a fog , which increase the darkness of the night . 
two gas_lamp be no more than a misleading glow . 
he might have be anywhere or nowhere . 
the pretence be that he was deliver a prescription from person . 
secretary_of_state person be a sick man . 
the idea had come from person , who had once be a chemist 's clerk . 
the sick were always receive medicine . 
no_one would question such an errand . 
the bottle be fill_up with flour . 
before person loom the group , person 's home , where person had once been kill . 
now it would have another death . 
from the outside it be an ordinary enough house of the gentry . 
he clomp heavily up the stoop and ring the bell . 
like the bell at mass , the doorbell was pitched too high . 
it be still good_friday , after_all . 
a nigger boy open the door . 
person do not notice him . 
he was think chiefly of person . 
if their schedule were to synchronize , there be no point in wasting_time . 
he push his way inside . 
for a moment the hall confuse him . 
this be the largest house he had ever be in , almost the largest building , except for a hotel . 
he have no idea where person 's room would be . 
in the half darkness the banister gleam , and the hall seem enormous . 
above him somewhere be the bedroom . 
person would be up there . 
he explain his errand , but without bother much to make it plausible , for he feel something well_up in him which be the reason why he had flee the army . 
he did not really want to kill , but as in the sex_act , there be a moment when the impulse take_over and could not be downed , even while you watch yourself give_way to it . 
he be no_longer worried . 
everything would be all_right . 
he know that in this mood he could not be stop . 
still , the sensation always surprise him . 
it be a thrill he feel no part in . 
he could only watch with a sort of gentle dismay while his body do these quick , appalling , and efficient thing . 
he brush by the idiotic boy and lumber heavily up_the_stairs . 
they be carpeted , but made for pumps and congress_gaiter , not the great clodhopper he wear . 
the sound of his footstep be like a muffled drum . 
at the top of the stairs he run_into somebody stand there angrily in a dressing_gown . 
he stop and whisper his errand . 
person hold_out his hand . 
pant a_little , person shake his head . 
person had tell him to deliver his package in_person . 
person say his father was sleep , and then go through a pantomime at his father 's door , to prove the statement . 
`` very_well '' , person say . 
`` i will go '' . 
he smile , but now that he know where the elder person be , he did not intend to go . 
he pull_out his pistol and fire it . 
it make no sound . 
it had misfire . 
reverse it , he smash the butt down on person 's head , over_and_over_again . 
it was the first blow that be always difficult . 
after that , violence be exultantly easy . 
he get caught_up into it and become a different person . 
only afterwards did an act like that become meaningless , so that he would puzzle_over it for day , whereas at the time it had seem quite real . 
the nigger boy flee down_the_stairs , scream , `` murder '' . 
it be not murder at_all . 
person be more methodical than that . 
he was merely clear a way to what he had_to do . 
he run for the sickroom , find his pistol be broken , and throw_away . 
a knife would do . 
from childhood he had know all about knife . 
someone block the door from inside . 
he smash it in and tumble into darkness . 
he see only dimly moving figure , but when he slash them they yell and flee . 
he go_for the bed , jump_on it , and strike where he could , repeatedly . 
it be like finally get_into one 's own nightmare to punish one 's dream . 
two man pull him off . 
nobody say anything . 
person hack at their arm . 
there be a lady there , in a nightdress . 
he would not have want to hurt a lady . 
another man approach , this one fully dressed . 
when the knife go_into his chest , he go_down at_once . 
`` i'm mad '' , shout person , as he run_out into the hall . 
`` i'm mad '' , and only wish he had be . 
that would have make thing so much easy . 
but he be not mad . 
he was only dream . 
he clatter down_the_stairs and out of the door . 
somewhere in the fog , the nigger boy was still yell murder . 
one always wake_up , even from one 's own dream . 
the clammy air revive him . 
person , he see , had flee . 
well , one did not expect much of people like person . 
he unhitch his horse , walk it away , mount , and spur it on . 
the nigger boy be close behind him . 
then the nigger boy turn_back and he be alone . 
he ride on and on . 
he have no idea where he be . 
after some time he come to an open field . 
an open field be better than a building , that be for_sure , so he dismount , turn off the horse , and plunge through the grass . 
he feel curiously sleepy , the world seem far away ; he know he should get to person , but he did n't know how . 
he be sure , for he had do as he was tell , had n't he ? 
person would find him and take care of him . 
so choose a good tree , he clamber up into it , find a comfortable notch , and curled_up in it to sleep , like the tousled bear he be , with his hand across his chest , as though surfeited with honey . 
violence always make him tired , but he be not frightened . 
in boston , person was wind_up a performance of a_new_way_to_pay_old_debts . 
it be a part so familiar to him that he did not bother to think_about it anymore . 
acting soothe him . 
on a stage he always know what to do , and tonight , to judge by the applause , he must be doing it better than usual . 
as person ( how often had he had_to play that part , who did not believe a word of it ) , he raise his arm and declaim : `` where be my honour now '' ? 
that be one of the high spot of the play . 
the audience , as_usual , love it . 
he be delighted to see them so happy . 
if he have any worry , it be only the small ones , about mother in new_york , and his daughter person and what she might be doing at this hour , with her person , in philadelphia . 
everyone be ambivalent about his profession , if he has practised it long enough , but there be still moment when he love the stage and all those unseen people out there , who might cheer you or boo you , but that be largely , though not entirely , up_to_you . 
they make the world seem friendly somehow , though he know it be not . 
person be quite right about one thing . 
person had be in the greenroom . 
the commotion had bring her into the wing . 
since she could not act , one part suit her as well as any other , and so she be the first person to offer person a glass of water , hold it up to the box , high above her head , to person , who had ask for it . 
she had be one of the first to collect her wit . 
it was not so much that the shot had stun the audience , as that they had been stun already . 
most of them had see our_american_cousin before , and unless person be on stage , there be not much to it . 
the theatre be hot and they were drug with boredom . 
the stage had be empty , except for person , do his star monologue . 
the audience be fond of person , he be a dear , in or out of character , but he be not particularly funny . 
at the end of the monologue the audience would applaud . 
meanwhile it look at the scenery . 
`` well , i guess i know enough to turn you inside_out , you sockdologizing old mantrap '' ! say person , otherwise person . 
there be always a pause here , before the next line . 
that be when the gun go_off . 
yet even that explosion did not mean much . 
gun were go_off all_over location these day , because of the celebration , and the theatre be not soundproof . 
then the audience see a small , dim figure appear at the edge of the presidential box . 
`` sic semper tyrannis '' , it say mildly . 
person had deliver his line . 
behind him billow a small pungent cloud of smoke . 
they strain forward . 
they had not hear what had been say . 
they had been sit too long to be able to stand_up easily . 
the figure leap from the box , almost lose its balance , the flag drape there tear in the air , the figure land on its left leg , fall on its hand , and press itself up . 
person still have his arm raise towards the wing . 
his speech falter . 
he did not lower his arm . 
the figure be so theatrically dressed , that it was as though a character from some other play had blunder into this one . 
the play for saturday night was to be a benefit performance of the_octoroon . 
this figure look_like the slave_dealer from that . 
but it also look_like a toad , hop away from the light . 
there be something maimed and crazy about its motion that disturb them . 
then it disappear into the wing . 
person had not shift position , but he at_last lower his arm . 
person scream . 
there was no mistaking that scream . 
it be what anyone who had ever see her had always expect her to do . 
yet this scream have a different note in it . 
that absence of an urgent self-indulgence dash them awake like a pail of water . 
person , one of the guest in the box , stand_up and demand water . 
her action be involuntary . 
when something unexpected happen , one always ask for water if one be a woman , brandy if one be a man . 
person scream again . 
in the presidential box someone lean over the balustrade and yell : `` he has shoot the person '' ! 
that get_up everybody up . 
on the stage , person begin to weep . 
person brush by him with the glass of water . 
the crowd begin to move . 
in location everyone live in a bubble of plot , and one death might attract another . 
it was not exactly panic they give_way to , but they could not just sit there . 
the beehive voice , for no_one could bear silence , drown_out the sound of person 's weeping . 
at the rear of the auditorium , upstairs , some man try to push open the door to the box corridor . 
it would not give . 
a person clamber up on the stage and get the actor to hoist him up to the box . 
in the audience a man name person lose his head and try to rescue a little girl from the mob , on the same principle which had lead person to demand water . 
someone open the corridor door from the inside , and call_for a doctor . 
somehow person was force through the mob and squeeze_out into the dingy corridor . 
he go straight to the presidential box . 
as_usual , person had lose her head , but nobody blame her for doing so now . 
there be a_little blood on the hem of her dress , for the assassin had slash person 's companion , person , with a knife . 
person say he was bleed to death . 
by the look of him he be n't that far_gone . 
with a sneer , the man spread his leg and , a third time , confront them . 
once_more , katie rear , and whinny in fearfully . 
for a moment , boy and mount hang in midair . 
person twist and , frantically , command the mare to leap straight ahead . 
but the stranger be nimble still . 
with a bold arm , he dared once_more to obstruct them . 
katie rear a third time , then , tremble , descend . 
the stranger leer . 
seize the bridle , he tug with all his might and force katie to her knee . 
it be absurd . 
person could feel himself topple . 
he see the ground come_up - and the stranger 's head . 
with incredible ferocity , he bring_together his fist together and strike . 
the blow encounter silky hair and hard bone . 
the man utter a weird cry , spin about , and collapse in the sand . 
katie scramble to her foot , person agilely retain his seat . 
again katie rear , and now , wickedly , he compel her to bring_down her hoof down again_and_again upon the sprawled figure of the stranger . 
he could feel his own foot , ironshod , strike repeatedly until the body be limp . 
he gloat , and his lip slaver . 
he hear himself chortle . 
they ride around and around to trample the figure into the sand . 
only the top of the head , with a spot bare and white as a clamshell , remain visible . 
person was shout triumphantly . 
a train hoot . 
instantly , he chill . 
they were pursue him . 
he be frightened ; his fist clutch so tightly that his knuckle hurt . 
then katie stumble , and again he was fall , fall ! 
`` person ! 
person '' ! 
his mother was nudge him , but he was still fall . 
his head hang over the board of katie 's stall ; before it was sprawl the mangled corpse of the bearded stranger . 
`` location , wake_up now ! 
we're nearly there '' . 
he had been dream . 
he be safe in his mama 's arm . 
the train had slow . 
house wink as the car roll beside a little depot . 
`` po ' location '' ! the trainman call . 
he come by and repeat , `` po ' location '' ! 
bong ! 
bong ! 
startle him awake . 
the room vibrate as if a giant hand had rock it . 
bong ! 
a dull boom and a throbbing echo . 
the wall bulge , the floor tremble , the windowpane rattle . 
he stare at the far morning , expect a pendulum to swing across the horizon . 
bong ! 
he race to the window and yank at the sash . 
bong ! 
the wood be old , the paint alligatored . 
bong ! 
a fresh breeze salute him . 
six o'clock ! 
he put his his head out . 
there be the slate_roof of the church ; ivy climb the red brick wall like a green scaled monster . 
the clock which had strike present an innocent face . 
in the kitchen mama was wipe the cupboard . 
`` there be a tower and a steeple on the church a_million foot high . 
and the loud clock in the whole world '' ! 
`` i know , person '' , she smile . 
`` they say that our steeple be one_hundred and sixty-two foot high . 
the clock you hear strike - it be really the town clock - was install last april by person , on her birthday '' . 
he dress , and speed outdoors . 
he cross location to location . 
the steeple lean backward , while the church advance like a headless creature in a long , shapeless coat . 
the spire seem to hold_up the sky . 
location , bask in the foothills , be the city_of_god . 
the group , with two steeple and its own school be on location ; the group be one block down location ; the catholic group , with an even tall steeple and a cross on top , stand on location . 
the catholic have the largest cemetery , near the location where location run south ; person whistle when he pass these alien grounds . 
god be everywhere , in the belfry , in the steeple , in the cloud , in the tree , and in the mountain hulk on the horizon . 
somewhere , beyond , where shadow lurk , must be the yawning pit of which papa preach and the dreadful location . 
so , walk in awe , he become familiar_with god , who reside chiefly in group with its high steeple and clock . 
there be no church like group , no preacher like papa , who be intimate with him , and could consign sinner to hellfire . 
to know god he must follow in papa 's footstep . 
he be fortunate , and proud . 
the veteran , idle on their bench in the location , beneath the soldier ' monument , got_to_their_feet when papa approach : `` morning , person '' ! 
his being and his will - person could not divide god from his papa - illumine every parish face , turn the choir into a band of angel , and the pulpit into the tollgate to heaven . 
`` we have nine hundred and eleven member in our charge '' , mama announce , `` and three hundred and eighty sunday_school scholar '' . 
when papa go_out to do god 's work , person often accompany him in the buggy , which was draw by violet , the new black mare . 
although they journey westerly as far as location , beyond the location roundhouse and the machine_shop , and along the location and location , and northward to brooklyn , below location , he could see the church spire wherever he look_back . 
sometimes they go south and roll past the tollhouse - `` afternoon , person '' ! 
- and cross the suspension_bridge to location ; that be pennsylvania . 
in the delaware_river , three long island be overgrown with greening tree and underbrush . 
south of location , and below the junction of the location and the delaware , be the location , from which person could spy new_jersey and pennsylvania , as_well_as new_york , simply by spin around on his heel . 
on these excursion , papa instruct him on man 's chief end , which be his duty to god and his own salvation . 
however , a boy 's lively eye might rove . 
where location purl into the location be a magnificent swimming_hole . 
papa point a scornful finger at the splash youth : `` idle recreation '' ! 
person see no idol ; it trouble him that he could n't always see what papa see . 
he be torn between the excitement in the sun inflamed water and a little engine chug northward on the location . 
`` where you be today '' ? 
person inquire every evening , pretend that he did not care . 
`` he'll make a preacher out of you '' ! 
`` no , he won't '' ! 
person flare . 
`` not me '' ! 
`` somebody 's got_to be a preacher in the family . 
he make a will and last testament before we leave location . 
i hear them ! 
person be the witness '' . 
`` will he die '' ? 
`` everybody does '' . 
person could be hateful . 
to speak of papa die be a sin . 
it could never happen as_long_as god be alert and the group steeple stand_guard with its peaked lance . 
person was constantly slip into the church . 
he pull with all his strength at the heavy , brass bound door , and shuffle along the wainscoted wall . 
the cold , mysterious presence of god be all around him . 
at the end of a shaft_of_light , the pew appear to be broad stairs in a long dungeon . 
far away , stand before a curtained window in the study room , be his father , hand tuck under his coattail , and stare into the dark church . 
the figure was wreathed in an extraordinary luminescence . 
the boy shudder at the deathly pale countenance with its wrinkle and gray hair . 
would papa really die ? 
the mouth be thin lipped and wide , the long cleft in the upper lip like a slide . 
when papa 's slender finger remove the spectacles , there be red indentation on the bridge of the strong nose . 
`` it 's time you begin to think on god , person . 
perhaps one day he will choose you as he choose me , long_ago . 
therefore , give him your affection and store up his love for you . 
open your heart to him and pray , person , pray ! 
for his mercy and his guidance to spare you from evil and eternal punishment in the location '' . 
person had hear these word many time , yet on each occasion they cause him to tremble . 
for he fear the location . 
he strive to think of god and his eternal wrath ; he must pray to be spare . 
person be disappointed that none of the brother had hear the call . 
not person , person , or person , certainly not person . 
person be at location and person at group , where they surely could not hear it . 
someday god would choose him . 
he would hear the call and would run to tell papa . 
the stern face would relax , the black clad arm would embrace him , `` my son '' ! 
yet how might he know the call when it come ? 
probably , as in scripture , a still , small voice would whisper . 
it would summon him once ; if he miss it , never_again . 
what if it come when he was play , or be asleep and dream ? 
he must not fail to hear it . 
he be papa 's chosen ; therefore , nothing but good could happen to him , even in god 's wrathful storm . 
when the sky grow dark and thunder roll across the valley , he be unafraid . 
person might fly into a closet , shut the door and bury her head in the clothes ; he dared to wait for the lightning . 
lightning could strike you blind if you be a sinner ! 
but he be good . 
he clench his fist and face the terror . 
thunder crash ; barrels tumble down the mountainside , and bounce and bounce till their own fury split them open . 
lightning might strike the steeple of the other church ; not of group . 
a flash illumine the tree as a crooked bolt twig in several direction . 
violet whinny from the stable . 
he run out into the downpour , speed across the yard and into the buggy room . 
`` do n't be afraid , violet '' ! 
he shout , and be aghast at the echo . 
`` do n't you be afraid '' ! 
he would save her . 
if there be a fire or a flood he would save mama first and violet next . 
drenched and shake , he stand near the sweet-smelling stall and dared to pat her muzzle . 
`` do n't you be afraid , violet '' ! 
after the storm , the sky clear blue and cool , and fragrant air sweep the hills . 
when the sun come_out , person stride proudly into location , smile like a landlord on industrious tenant . 
the fountain had brim_over , the cannon be wet , the soldier ' monument glisten . 
even before the bench had dry , the civil_war veteran were straggle back to their place . 
the great spire shine as if the lightning had polish it . 
he jump . 
the pointed shadow had nearly touch him . 
he trail person to the baseball_game in the lot on location near the group . 
`` go_on home '' ! 
person screech at him . 
`` someone 'll tell papa '' ! 
no_one tell_on person , not even when he slip live grasshopper into the mite_box . 
person do as he please . 
person take his slingshot and climb to the rooftop to shoot at crow . 
person chew roofer 's tar . 
person have a cigar_box full of marble and shooter , and a roman_candle from last fourth_of_july . 
person hop ride on freight_car , and was chase by person , the railroad guard . 
he come home overheated , run straight to the ice_chest , and gulp shivery cold water . 
person envy him . 
that person ! 
he , too , cock his cap at a jaunty angle , jingle marble in his pocket , and swagger down location . 
on the person ' lawn , little girl in white pinafore were play grownup at a tea_party . 
a newfoundland sit solemnly beside a doghouse half his size . 
person yearn for a dog . 
he wonder whether god have a dog in the sky . 
he meander down location , past the group with its green window_shade . 
he cross the track to group , where lady in gay dress and man in straw boater and waxed mustache crowd the verandah . 
a tall lady , with a ruffled collar very low on her bosom , turn insolent green eye upon him . 
she be tall than person . 
she be so beautiful with her rosy mouth and haughty air that she had to be wicked . 
fiddle screech ; a piano tinkle . 
`` location '' - as person call the town - be crowded with summer people who come to the mountain to escape the heat in the big city . 
they stay_at hotel and boardinghouse , or at private home . 
rich people go_to group , group , group or group . 
if the crummy bastard could write ! 
that 's how it should be . 
it 's those two fucken nigger ! 
krist , i wish they could write ! 
nigger pussy . 
he think_of sweet wet nigger pussy . 
oh , sweet land of heaven , haint there just nothin like sweet nigger pussy ! 
he think_of her , the first one .

she be a juicy one .

he think_of person , the nigger who had go_after his sister . 
he chuckle , the memory vivid .

goddamn nigger , lord .

sonuvabitch , i can n't figure_out what in hell for they go and put nigger in my squad for . 
only one worth a shit , and that 's person . 
he ai n't so bad . 
his thought turn_to other thing . 
the big shock everybody have when they find ol person and those others done_for . 
kaboom for . 
he had be pretty scare himself , wonder what_the_hell was come_off . 
but he soon see which way the ball was bounce . 
soon come_back to his sense . 
`` i soon come_back to my sense '' , he say , aloud , to the young blizzard , proudly , draw_up himself up , as if making a report to some important superior . 
i be the first to get my squad on_the_ball , and anybody thinkin it be easy be pretty damn dumb . 
look_at thum . 
that goddamn redheader be the worst . 
he keep sayin , not me , not me , i do n't wanta wind_up like em . 
but i tell him , goddammit . 
`` i tell him '' , he say aloud . 
`` they 'll get the guy that done it . 
that 'll put the place back to normal . 
normal , by god . 
maybe it 's a good thing it happen . 
maybe they 'll stop it now , once_and_for_all for all . 
clean_up the place up . 
they 're doin it now . 
i hear the whole bunch is croakin out in the snow . 
they 'll get the guy that done it '' . 
there be something trouble him though : as_yet they had n't . 
five day . 
keerist . 
prickly twinge of annoyance run_through him . 
his eye blink hard , snap on and squash some bad thing that were try to push their way into him . 
a tune begin to whirl inside his head . 
one of his favorite : `` guitar_boogie '' . 
it always come_on , faithfully , just like a radio or jukebox , whenever he start to worry too_much about something , when the bad thing try to push their way into him . 
the music drive_off them off , or away , and he be free to walk_on_air in a very few moment , hum and jive within , beat the rhythm within . 
he glow with anticipation about what would happen to the culprit when they catch them . 
turn_over the bastard over to me - to me and my boy - no nigger ever get what would be comin to them - reactionary bastard . 
he had never hear the word reactionary before his life as a pow begin . 
it be a word he be proud_of , a word that mean much to him , and he use it with great pleasure , almost as if it be an exclusive possession , and more : he sense himself to be very highly educated , four_cuts_above any of the folk back home . 
`` four_cuts at_least '' , he chuckle to himself , `` and i owe it all to them '' . 
the word also make him feel hate , sincere hate , for those so label . 
he use it very effectively when he wanted to get his squad on_the_ball . 
it come_up again_and_again in the discussion session . 
lousy reactionary bastard been tryin to fuck_up the program for month . 
month . 
hired , hard lackey of the warmongering capitalist . 
not capture , send here . 
to fuck_up the program . 
you guy remember that . 
remember that . 
he hear himself harangue them . 
he see himself before them deliver the speech .

fuck them * * h he roll_over and try to shut_out the noise , now much loud . 
he snuggle into the blanket * * h person dream . 
he was sit on top of a log which was spin round and around in the water . 
a river , wide as the missouri , where it run_by his place . 
the log was spin . 
but he was not . 
so what ? 
why should i be spin just because the goddamn log is spin ? 
( he ask this out_loud , but no_one hear it over the other noise in the hut ) . 
over on the bank , the west bank , a man stand , call to him . 
he could n't make_out what he was say . 
no_doubt it have to do with the log . 
why should he be concerned ? 
rousseau be so persuasive that voltaire is almost convinced that he should burn his book , too . 
but while the two man are ride into the country , where they are go to dinner , they are attack in the dark of the forest by a band of thief , who strip them of everything , include most of their clothes . 
`` you must be a very learned man '' , say voltaire to one of the bandit . 
`` a learned man '' ? the bandit laugh in his face . 
but voltaire persevere . 
he go_to the chief himself . 
`` at what university do you study '' ? he ask . 
he refuse to believe that the bandit chief never attend a higher institution . 
`` to have become so corrupt '' , he say , `` surely you must have study many arts and science '' . 
the chief , annoy by these question , knock_down voltaire down and shout at him that he not_only never go_to any school , but never even learn how to read . 
when finally the two bedraggled man reach their friend 's home , voltaire 's fear are once_again arouse . 
for it be such a distinguished place , with such fine work_of_art and such a big library , that there can be little doubt but that the owner has become deprave by all this culture . 
to voltaire 's surprise , however , their host give them fresh clothes to put_on , open his purse to lend them money and sit_down them down before a good dinner . 
immediately after dinner , however , rousseau ask for still another favor . 
could he have pen and paper , please ? 
he be in a hurry to write another essay against culture . 
such be the impromptu that voltaire give to howl of laughter at location and that was soon circulate in manuscript throughout the literary circle of europe , to be print sometime later , but with the name of person , the famous misanthrope , substitute for that of rousseau . 
how cruel ! 
but at_the_same_time how understandable . 
how could the rich , for whom life was make so simple , ever understand the subterfuge , the lie , the fraud , the error , sin and even crime to which the poor were drive in their effort to overcome the great advantage the rich have in the race of life ? 
how , for_example , could a voltaire understand the strange predicament in which a rousseau would find himself when , soon after the furor of his first discourse , he acquire still another title to fame ? 
this time as a musician . 
as a composer . 
ever since he had first begin to study music and to teach it , rousseau had dream of pierce through to fame as the result of a successful opera . 
but his facility in this genre be not great . 
and his effort to get a performance for his gallant_muses invariably fail . 
and for good reason . 
his operatic music have little merit . 
but then one day , while on a week 's visit to the country home of a retired swiss jeweler , rousseau amuse the company with a_few little melody he had write , to which he attach no great importance . 
he be really amazed to discover the other guest so excite about these delicate little song . 
`` put a_few such song together '' , they urge him . 
`` string them onto some sort of little plot , and you 'll have a delightful operetta '' . 
he did n't believe them . 
`` nonsense '' , he say . 
`` this be the sort of stuff i write and then throw_away '' ! 
`` heaven_forbid '' ! cry the lady , enchant by his music . 
`` you must make an opera out of this material '' . 
and they would n't leave_off argue and plead until he had promise . 
oh , the irony and the bitterness of_it ! 
that after all his year of effort to become a composer , he should now , now when he was still stoutly reply to the critic of his discourse_on_the_arts_and_sciences , be so close to a success in music and have_to reject it . 
or at_least appear to reject it ! 
but what else could he do ? 
you could n't on_the_one_hand decry the art and at_the_same_time practice them , could you ? 
well , yes , perhaps in literature , since you could argue that you could n't keep silent about your feeling against literature and so were involved in spite of yourself . 
but now music too ? 
no . 
that would be too_much ! 
and the fault , of_course , be person 's . 
the fault be person 's and that of the whole culture of this parisian age . 
for it was person 's type of music that he had been try to write , and that he could n't write . 
these little song , however , be sweet_nothings from_the_heart , tender memory of his childhood , little melody that anyone could hum and that would make one want to weep . 
but no . 
he could n't appear as a composer now . 
that glory , crave for so long , was now forbid to him . 
still , just for the lady , and just for this once , for this one weekend in the country , he would make a little piece out of his melody . 
the lady be delight and person was applaud . 
and everyone went to work to learn the part which he write . 
but then , after the little operetta had been give its feeble amateur rendering , everyone insist that it be too good to be lost forever , and that the group must now have the manuscript in_order to give it the really first-rate performance it merit . 
person be aware that he must seem like a hypocrite , stand there and argue that he could not possibly permit a public performance . 
the lady especially could n't understand what trouble him . 
a contradiction ? 
bah , what be a contradiction in one 's life ? 
every woman has have the experience of say no when she mean yes , and say yes when she mean no . 
person had_to admit that though he could n't agree to a public performance , he would indeed , just for his own private satisfaction , dearly love to know how his work would sound when do by professional musician and by trained voice . 
`` i 'd simply like to know if it be as_good_as you kind people seem to think '' , he say . 
person , the historian , point_out to person that this be impossible . 
the musician of the group would not rehearse a work merely to see how it would sound . 
merely to satisfy the author 's curiosity . 
rousseau agree . 
but he recall that person had once have a private performance of his opera armide , behind closed door , just for himself alone . 
person understand what was bother rousseau : that the writer of the prosopopoeia_of_fabricius should now become known as the writer of an amusing little operetta . 
that would certainly be paradoxical . 
but person think he see a way_out . 
`` let me do the submit to the group '' , he suggest . 
`` your name will never appear . 
no_one will even suspect that it be your work '' . 
to_that rousseau could agree . 
but now what crazy twist and turn of his emotion ! 
afraid at one_and_the_same time that his work might be turn_down - which would be a blow to his pride even_though no_one know he be the author - and that the work would be accept , and then that his violent feeling in the matter would certainly betray how deeply concern he be in_spite_of himself . 
and how anxious this lover of obscurity be for applause ! 
and thus torn between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera and the necessity of remain true to his proclaimed desire for anonymity , rousseau suffer through several painful week . 
all these emotion were screw_up to new height when , after acceptance and the first rehearsal , there ensue such a buzz of excitement among parisian music_lover that person had_to come run to rousseau to inform him that the news had reach the superintendent of the king 's amusement , and that he was now demand that the work be offer first at the royal summer palace of location . 
imagine the honor of_it ! 
`` what be your answer '' ? 
person ask , strive to appear unimpressed . 
`` i refuse '' , person say . 
`` what else could i do ? 
person be incensed , of_course . 
but i say i would first have_to get the author 's permission . 
and i be certain he would refuse '' . 
how infuriating all this be ! 
why had not this success come to him before he had plunge into his discourse , and before he had commit himself to a life of austerity and denial ? 
now , when everything was open_up to him - even the court of person 15 , ! 
- he had_to play a role of self-effacement . 
back_and_forth person had_to go , between person and person and between the person and person again , as his little operetta , the_village_soothsayer , though still unperformed , take_on ever more importance . 
and of_course the news of who the composer be did finally begin to get_around among his close friend . 
but they , naturally , keep his secret well , and the public at_large know only of a great excitement in musical and court circle . 
how titillating it be to go among people who did not know him as the composer , but who talk in the most glowing term of the promise of the piece after having hear the first rehearsal . 
the furor be such_that people who could not possibly have squirm their way into the rehearsal were pretend that they be intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational . 
and listen to such a conversation one morning while take a cup of chocolate in a cafe , person find himself bathe in perspiration , tremble lest his authorship become known , and at_the_same_time dream of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer . 
he feel himself now , as he himself say in his confessions , at a crucial point of his life . 
and that be why , on the day of the performance , when a carriage from the royal stable call to take him to the palace , he did not bother to shave . 
on_the_contrary , he be pleased that his face show a neglect of several day . 
see him in that condition , and about to enter the hall where the person , the queen , the whole royal_family and all the member of the high aristocracy would be present , person and the person and_others try to stop him . 
`` you can n't go_in that way '' ! they cry . 
`` why not '' ? 
person ask . 
`` who is go_to stop me '' ? 
`` you have n't dress for the occasion '' ! they point_out to him . 
`` i'm dress as i always am '' , person say . 
`` neither good nor worse '' . 
`` at home , yes '' , they argue . 
`` but here you be in the palace . 
there 's the king . 
and person '' . 
`` if they be here , then surely i have the right to be here '' , person say . 
`` and even more right . 
since i be the composer '' ! 
`` but in such a slovenly condition '' . 
`` what be slovenly about me '' ? 
person ask . 
`` is it because of my slovenliness that hair grow on my face ? 
surely it would grow there whether i wash myself or not . 
a_hundred year ago i would have wear a beard with_pride . 
and those without beard would have stand_out as not dress for the occasion . 
now times have change , and i must pretend that hair does n't grow on my face . 
that 's the fashion . 
and fashion be the real king here . 
not person , , since even he obey . 
now , if you do n't mind , i should_like to hear my own piece perform '' . 
but of_course behind his boldness he did n't feel bold at_all . 
he tremble lest his piece should fail . 
and this in_addition to his usual fear of be among people of high_society . 
his fear of make some inane or inappropriate remark . 
and even deep than that : 
his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly itch to relieve_oneself . 
could he walk out in_the_midst of his piece ? 
here , before the court ? 
before the king ? 
it be the first time any of us had laugh since the morning begin . 
the rider from concord be as_good_as his word . 
he come spur and whoop down the road , his horse kick_up cloud of dust , shout : 
`` they 're a-coming ! 
by god , they 're a-coming , they are '' ! 
we hear him before he ever show , and we hear him yell after he be out_of_sight . 
person had n't misjudge the strength of his lung , not at all . 
i think you could have hear him a mile away , and he was burst at every seam with importance . 
i have observe that be up on a horse change the whole character of a man , and when a very small man be up on a saddle , he 'd like as not prefer to eat his meal there . 
that 's understandable , and i appreciate the sentiment . 
as for this rider , i never see him before or afterwards and never see him dismounted , so whether he stand tall or short in his shoe , i can n't say ; but i do know that he give the day tone and distinction . 
the last thing in_the_world that resemble a war be our line of farmer and storekeeper and mechanic perch on top of a stone_wall , and this dashing rider make us feel a good_deal sharp and more alert to the situation . 
we come_down off the wall as if he had topple all_of us , and we crouch behind it . 
i have hear people talk with contempt about the british regular , but that only prove that a_lot of people talk_about thing of which they be deplorably ignorant . 
whatever we feel about the redcoat , we respect them in_terms_of their trade , which be killing ; and i know that i , myself , be nauseated with apprehension and fear and that my hand be soaking wet where they hold my gun . 
i wanted to wipe my flint , but i did n't dare to , the state my hand be in , just as i did n't dare to do anything about the priming . 
the gun would fire or not , just as chance will . 
i put a_lot more trust in my two leg than in the gun , because the most important thing i had learn about war be that you could run_away and survive to talk_about it . 
the gunfire , which be so near that it seem just a piece up the road now , stop for long enough to count to twenty ; and in that brief interval , a redcoat officer come tear down the road , whip his horse fit to kill . 
i do n't know whether he be_after our rider , who had go_by a minute before , or whether he was simply scout condition ; but when he pass_by us by , a musket roar , and he rear his horse , swing it around , and begin to whip it back in the direction from which he had come . 
he be a fine and showy rider , but his skill was wasted on us . 
from above me and somewhere behind me , a rifle crack . 
the redcoat officer collapse like a punctured bolster , and the horse rear and throw him from the saddle , except that one booted foot catch in the stirrup . 
half crazed by the weight drag , the dust , and the heat , the horse leap our wall , dash out the rider 's brain against it , and leave him lie there among us - while the horse crash away through the brush . 
it be my initiation to war and the insane symphony war play ; for what had happen on the common be only terror and flight ; but this grinning , broken head , not ten foot away from me , be the sharp definition of what my reality had become . 
and now the redcoat were come , and the gunfire be a part of the dust_cloud on the road to the west of us . 
i must state that the fast thing happen , the slow they happen ; the passage and rhythm of time change , and when i remember back to what happen then , each event be a separate and frozen incident . 
in my recollection , there be a long interval between the death of the officer and the appearance of the first of the retreating redcoat , and in that interval the dust_cloud over the road seem to hover indefinitely . 
yet it could not have be more than a matter of second , and then the front of the british army come into view . 
it was only hour since i had last see them , but they had change and i had change . 
in the very front rank , two man be wounded and stagger along , trail blood behind them . 
no drummer here , no piper , and the redcoat be covered with a fine film of dust . 
they march with bayonet fixed , and as fixed on their face be anger , fear , and torment . 
rank after rank of them come_down the road , and the face be all the same , and they walk in a sea of dust . 
`` committeeman , hold your fire ! 
hold your fire '' ! 
a voice call , and what make it even more terrible and unreal be that the redcoat rank never pause for an instant , only some of them glance toward the stone_wall , from behind which the voice come . 
the front of their column had already pass us , when another officer come ride down the side of the road , not five pace from where we be . 
my person carry a musket , but he had load it with bird_shot , and as the officer come opposite him , he rise_up behind the wall and fire . 
one moment there be a man in the saddle ; the next a headless horror on a horse that bolt through the redcoat rank , and during the next second or two , we all_of us fire into the suddenly disorganized column of soldier . 
one moment , the road be filled with disciplined troops , march four by four with a purpose as implacable as death ; the next , a cloud of gun_smoke cover a screaming fury of sound , out of which the redcoat soldier emerge with their bayonet and their cursing fury . 
in the course of_this , they had fire on us ; but i have no memory of_that . 
i had squeeze the trigger of my own gun , and to my amazement , it had fire and kick_back into my shoulder with the force of an angry mule ; and then i was add my own voice to the crescendo of sound , hurl more vile language than i ever think i know , sob and shout , and aware that if i had pass_water before , it be not enough , for my pants be soaking wet . 
i would have stand there and die there if leave to myself , but person grab my arm in his viselike grip and fairly pluck me out of there ; and_then i come_to some sanity and plunge away with such extraordinary speed that i outdistance person by_far . 
everyone else was run . 
later we realize that the redcoat had stop their charge at the wall . 
their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep march . 
we tumble to a stop in person 's cow hole , a low-lying bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its middle . 
a dozen cow moo sadly and regard us as if we be insane , as perhaps we be at that moment , with the crazy excitement of our first encounter , the yelling and shooting still continue up at the road , and the thirst of some of the man , which be so great that they wade into the muddy water and scoop_up handful of_it . 
person , one of the man from location , had take a musket_ball in his belly ; and though he had find the strength to run with us , now he collapse and lie on the ground , die , the reverend hold his head and wipe his hot brow . 
it may appear that we be cruel and callous , but no_one have time to spend sympathize_with poor person - except the person . 
i know that i myself feel that it be a mortal shame for a man to be tear open by a british musket_ball , as person had been , yet i also feel relieved and lucky that it had be him and not myself . 
i be drunk with excitement and the smell of gunpowder that come float down from the road , and the fact that i be not afraid now , but only wait to know what to do next . 
meanwhile , i reload my gun , as the other man were doing . 
we be less than a quarter of a mile from the road , and we could trace its shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and dust that hang over it . 
wherever you look , you see committeeman run across the meadow , some away from the road , some toward it , some parallel to it ; and about a mile to the west a cluster of at_least fifty militia were make_one's_way their way in our direction . 
person and some others feel that we should march toward location and take_up new position ahead of the slow-moving british column , but another group maintain that we should stick to this spot and this section of road . 
i did n't offer any advice , but i certainly did not want to go_back to where the officer lie with his brain dash out . 
someone say that while we were stand here and argue about it , the_british would be go ; but person say he had watch them march west early in the morning , and move at a much brisk pace it had still take half an hour for their column to pass , what with the narrowness of the road and their baggage and ammunition cart . 
while this was being discuss , we see the militia to the west of us fan_out and break into little cluster of two and three man as they approach the road . 
it was the opinion of some of us that these must be part of the committeeman who had be in the battle_of_the_north_bridge , which entitle them to a sort of veteran status , and we feel that if they employ this tactic , it be likely enough the best one . 
person say : 
`` it make_sense . 
if we cluster together , the redcoat can make an advantage out of_it , but there 's not a blessed thing they can do with two or three of us except chase us , and we can outrun them '' . 
that settle it , and we break into party of two and three . 
person decide to remain with the person and poor person until life pass_away - and he be hurt so badly he did not seem for long in this world . 
i go_off with person , who maintain that if he did n't see to me , he did n't know who would . 
`` good_heavens , person '' , he say , `` i think one thing you 'd have no trouble learning be when to get_out of a place '' . 
`` i learn that now '' , i say . 
we run east for about half a mile before we turn_back to the road , pant from the effort and soaked with sweat . 
there be a clump of tree that appear to provide cover right up_to the road , and the shouting and gunfire never slacken . 
under the tree , there be a dead redcoat , a young boy with a pasty white skin and a face full of pimple , who had take a rifle_ball directly between the eye . 
three man be around him . 
they had strip him of his musket and equipment , and now they were pull_off his boot and jacket off . 
person grab one of them by the shoulder and fling him away . 
`` god's_name , what be you to rob the dead with the fight go_on '' ! 
person roar . 
they try to outface him , but person be as wide as two average man , and it would have take brave man than these be to outface him . 
that summer the gambling_house were close , despite the threat of person , a gaming_card manufacturer . 
dancing was no_longer permit in the street . 
the group and other place of prostitution were empty . 
the slit breeches had_to go . 
drunkenness was no_longer tolerate . 
in defiance , a chinless reprobate , person , march down the aisle in group 's one sunday morning , follow by one of the woman from the group , whose dress and walk plainly show the lack of any shame . 
plunk themselves down on the front bench , they turn to smirk at those around them . 
person 's first impulse be to denounce their blasphemy . 
but the thought occur that god would want this opportunity used to tell them about him . 
calmly he open the bible and read of the woman at the well . 
he finish the worship service as if there had be no brazen attempt to dishonor god and man . 
the next morning , as the clock strike nine , he appear at the council meeting in the location and insist that the couple would have_to be punish if the church was to be respect . 
`` i have tell you before , and i tell you again '' , person say rudely . 
`` stick_to the preaching of the gospel '' ! 
person stiffen in anger . 
`` that is the answer the ungodly will always make when the church point its finger at their sin . 
i say to you that the church will ever decry evil '' ! 
person 's reply be like a declaration of war . 
person sit_down in his high-backed stall , lip compressed , eye glinting . 
person , a short man with a rotunda of stomach , rise . 
every eye be on him as he begin to speak . 
`` what person say be true . 
how can we have a good city unless we respect morality '' ? 
person , a tall man with sunken cheek and deep-set eye , got_to_his_feet . 
`` we all know that person and the woman are brazenly live together . 
it would be well to show the populace how we deal with adulterer '' . 
person , the son of the famous patriot , disagree . 
`` do not listen to that frenchman . 
he is throttle the liberty my father give his life to win '' ! 
person be quietly insistent . 
`` there can be no compromise when soul be in jeopardy '' . 
a week later the sentence of the council was carry_out : person and the woman were march naked through the street past a mocking populace . 
before them stalk the beadle , proclaim as he go , `` thus the council deal with those who break its law - adulterer , thief , murderer , and lewd person . 
let evildoer contemplate their way , and let every man beware '' ! 
person 's thought race painfully into the past as he read the letter he had just receive from his sister person . 
person had die two_weeks before , in early november , without being reconcile to the church . 
the canon , in a body , had try to force him on his deathbed to let them give him the last_rites of the church , but he had die still proclaim salvation by faith . 
burial had take_place at night in the ground at the public crossroads under the gibbet , so that his enemy could not find his body and have it dig_up and burn . 
the abbot of group , person , had be a good friend , but not even he think person deserve burial in hallowed ground . 
person close his eye and see once_again the little niche in his mother 's bedroom , where she had kneel to tell the good person of her need . 
the blue draped person be still there , but no_one kneel before her now . 
not even person ; she , too , pray only to god . 
for an instant person long for the sound of the bell of location , the touch of his mother 's hand , the lilt of person 's voice in the square raftered room , his father 's bass tone rumble to the canon , and the sight of the beloved bishop . 
but he had_to follow the light . 
unless god expect a man to believe the holy_scripture , why had he give them to him ? 
the white clad tree stand like specter in the february night . 
snow bury the street and cover the slanting rooftop , as person trudge toward group 's . 
a carriage crunch by , its dim light filter through the gloom . 
the sharp wind slap at him and his foot feel like ice as the snow penetrate the hole of his shoe , his only ones , now patched with folded parchment . 
the city had recently give him a small salary , but it be not enough to supply even necessity . 
as he near the square , a round figure muffled in a long , black cape whisk_by . 
person recognize person and call_out a greeting . 
how grateful he be to such man ! 
there be several on the council who try to live like christian . 
despite their effort , the problem seem to grow grave all_the_time . 
quicken his step , person enter the vast church and climb the tower steps to the bell . 
underneath the big one , in the silent moonlight , lie a dead pigeon , and on the smaller bell , the clemence , two gray and white bird sleep huddle_together in the cold winter air . 
person lean upon the stone balustrade . 
he brush back his black hair , shove it under his pastor 's cap to keep it from blow in his eye . 
below the moon-splashed world roll away to insurmountable white peak ; above him the deep blue sky glitter with star . 
he stand_still very still , his arm at his side , stare up at the heavens , then down at the blinking light below . 
`` how long , my lord ? 
how long ? 
i have never ask for an easy task , but i be weary of the strife '' . 
sleep be difficult these day . 
indigestion plague him . 
severe headache be frequent . 
loneliness tear through him like a physical pain whenever he think_of person , person , person , person , and even the compromising person . 
an occasional traveler from italy bring news of person , who was now distribute his bible among the location peasant . 
letter come regularly from person , person , and person . 
he have person and person to confide in and consult . 
but person continue to find a bitter joy in smash image and tear_down symbol sacred to the group . 
person find it difficult , but he hold him in check . 
and person be busy most of the time court this girl and that . 
his easy good_looks make him a favorite with the lady . 
location , instead of become the city_of_god , as person had dream , had in the two year since he had be there , continue to be a godless place where all manner of vice flourish . 
refugee pour in , sign the confession and rule in_order to remain , and then disregard them . 
dice roll , prostitute ply their trade , thief steal , murderer stab , and the ungodly blaspheme . 
catholic who be truly christian long for the simple penance of day go_by . 
libertine recall the heroism of the past and demand : `` are we go_to allow the protestant_pope , person , to curtail our liberty ? 
why , oh why , does n't he stick_to preaching the gospel , instead of meddling in civic affair , politics , economics , and social issue that be no concern of the church '' ? 
and person 's reply be always the same : `` anything that affect soul be the concern of the church ! 
we will have righteousness '' ! 
tears burn behind his eye as he pray and meditate tonight . 
unless the confusion clear , he would not be come here much longer . 
person 's threat would become a reality , for he continue to proclaim loudly that the city must rid itself of `` that frenchman '' . 
the slow tapping of a cane on the stone steps come up to the tower interrupt his reverie . 
faint at_first , the tapping grow until it sound loud against the wind . 
person ! 
person think . 
what is he do here at this hour ? 
he start down the steps to meet the near-blind preacher , who had be one of the early gospeler in location . 
`` person ? 
be that you ? 
i come to warn you of a plot '' ! 
person stand above him , his face ashen . 
what now ? 
slowly , like a man grow old , he take person 's hand and lead him below to the tower study , guide him to a chair beside the little hearth where a fire still burn . 
`` plot '' ? 
person ask tiredly . 
`` person just paid me a visit . 
i go_to your room , and person tell me you be here . 
two anabaptist , person and person , are to challenge you and person to a debate before the council . 
it is to be a trap . 
you know the law : if you lose the debate after accept a challenge , you will be banish '' ! 
`` what will be the subject '' ? 
`` you are to be accuse of arianism to confuse the religious who remain loyal '' . 
anger and fear fuse in person . 
ever since the fourth century a controversy had rage over the person of christ . 
those who refuse to believe that he be the eternal son of god were term arianist . 
person had come to location , say that he had be a bishop of the church_of_rome and had been persecute in paris for his reformed faith . 
he ask to be appoint a preacher . 
but person had unmask him , reveal he had never be a bishop , but be an anabaptist , afraid to state his faith , because he know person had write a book against their belief that the soul sleep after death . 
so person had refuse to agree to his appointment as a preacher , and now person seek revenge . 
person sigh . 
`` if person agree , we should insist on a public_debate '' , he say at_length . 
`` there be more to the conspiracy . 
person demand that the lord's_supper be administer here as it used_to be , with unleavened_bread . 
furthermore , bern decree that we must do as we are order by the council , preach only the word_of_god and stop meddling in politics '' ! 
`` it was always the spirit with christ ; matter such_as leavened or unleavened_bread be inconsequential . 
location must remain a sovereign state . 
we will not yield to the demand of bern '' ! 
the firelight play over person 's flowing white lock and rugged feature . 
`` person indicate that if i would cooperate , after you and person are banish , following the debate , i will be give a place of influence '' . 
`` what be your reply to that '' ? 
`` that i would rather be banish with two such christian than be make the person '' ! 
the following morning , as person enter the location on his way to visit a sick refugee , he have a premonition of danger . 
then suddenly a group of man and dog circle him . 
he wanted to run , but he know that if he did , he would be lost . 
he stand very still , his heart thump wildly . 
on the outskirts of the rabble the person brother and person shake their fist . 
`` are you go_to comply with the demand of bern '' ? 
the chinless person call . 
`` arianist '' ! a rowdy with a big blob of a nose roar . 
`` heretic '' ! 
person lift his hand for silence . 
`` know this : the minister will not yield to the demand of bern '' . 
his voice shake a_little . 
somebody heave a stone . 
for an instant person be stun . 
when he feel the side of his head , his finger come_away cover with blood . 
before he could duck , another stone strike him . 
and another . 
`` let him be now '' ! 
person , the gaming_card manufacturer say , his little pig eye glaring . 
`` we have teach him a lesson '' . 
the crowd move_back and person start dizzily down the hill . 
fist pummel him as he stagger forward . 
then he slip and go_down on his hand and knee in the melting snow . 
at_once a bevy of dog was snap and snarl around him . 
one , more horrible than the rest , lunge , growl deep in his throat , his hair bristle . 
with great difficulty person clamber to his foot and start to run , sweat pour down his face . 
stand in the shelter of the tent - a rejected hospital tent on which the rain now drip , no_longer drum - person watch his own hand touch the object on the improvised counter of board lay across two beef barrel . 
there be , of_course , no real need to rearrange everything . 
a quarter inch this way or that for the hardbake , or the toffee , or the barley sugar , or the sardine , or the bitters , or the condensed_milk , or the stationery , or the needle - what could it mean ? 
person watch his own hand make the caress , anxious movement that , when rain fall and nobody come , and ruin draw_close like a cat rub against the ankle , has be the ritual of stall vendor , forever . 
he recognize the gesture . 
he know its meaning . 
he had see a dry , old , yellow hand reach_out , with that painful solicitude , to touch , to rearrange , to shift aimlessly , some object worth a pfennig . 
back in bavaria he had see that gesture , and at that sight his heart had always die within him . 
on such occasion he had not have the courage to look at the face above the hand , whatever face it might be . 
now the face be his own . 
he wonder what expression , as he make that gesture , be on his face . 
he wonder if it wear the old anxiety , or the old , taut stoicism . 
but there be no need , he remember , for his hand to reach_out , for his face to show concern or stoicism . 
it was nothing to him if rain fall and nobody come . 
then why was he assume the role - the gesture and the suffering ? 
what was he expiate ? 
or was he now take the role - the gesture and the suffering - because it be the only way to affirm his history and identity in the torpid , befog loneliness of this land . 
this be virginia . 
he look_out of the tent at the company street . 
the rain drip on the freezing loblolly of the street . 
beyond that misty gray of the rain , he see the stretching hutment , low diminutive log_cabin , chinked with mud , with doorway a man would have_to crouch to get through , with roof of tenting lay_over bough or board from hardtack box , or fence_rail , with cranky chimney of stick and dry mud . 
the chimney of the hut across from him was surmount by a beef barrel with end knock_out . 
in this heavy air , however , that device did not seem to help . 
the smoke from that chimney rise as sluggishly as smoke from any other , and hang as sadly in the drizzle , creep back_down along the sopping canvas of the roof . 
over the door be a board with large , inept lettering : 
home_sweet_home . 
this be the hut of person , the hero . 
the man were huddle in those lair . 
person know the name of some . 
he know the face of all , hairy or shaven , old or young , fat or thin , suffering or hardened , sad or gay , good or bad . 
when they stand about his tent , chaff each other , exchange their obscenity , curse command or weather , he had study their face . 
he had have the need to understand what life lurk behind the mask of flesh , behind the oath , the banter , the sadness . 
once covertly look at person , the only man in the world whom he hate , he had see the heavy , slack , bestubbled jaw open and close to emit the cruel , obscene banter , and had see the pale blue eye go watery with whisky and merriment , and suddenly he was not see the face of that vile creature . 
he was see , somehow , the face of a young boy , the boy person must once have be , a boy with sorrel hair , and blue eye dance with gaiety , and the boy mouth grinning trustfully among the freckle . 
in that moment of vision person hear the voice within himself say : i must not hate him , i must not hate him or i shall die . 
his heart suddenly open to joy . 
he think that if once , only once , he could talk with person , something about his own life , and all life , would be clear and simple . 
if person would turn_to him and say : `` person , you know when i be a boy , it was a funny thing happen . 
lemme tell you now '' - 
if only person could do that , whatever the thing he remember and tell . 
it would be a sign for the untellable , and he , person , would understand . 
now , person , in the gray light of afternoon , stare across at the hut opposite his tent , and think_of person lie in there in the gloom , snore on his bunk , with the fumes of whisky choke the air . 
he see the sign above the door of the hut : home_sweet_home . 
he see the figure of a man in a poncho come up the company street , with an armful of wood . 
it be person , the campmate of person . 
he carry the wood , carry the water , do the cooking , cleaning and mend , and occasionally get a kick_in_the_butt for his pains . 
person watch the moisture flow from the poncho . 
it give the rubberized fabric a dull gleam , like metal . 
person humbly lower his head , push_aside the hardtack box door of the hut , and be go from sight . 
person stare at the door and remember that person had been award the medal_of_honor for gallantry at location . 
the street be again empty . 
the drizzle was slack_off now , but the light be gray . 
with enormous interest , person watch his hand as they touch and shift the object on the board directly before him . 
into the emptiness of the street , and his spirit , move a form . 
the form was swathe in an army blanket , much patch , fasten at the neck with a cord . 
from under the shapeless huddle of blanket the foot move in the mud . 
the foot wear army shoe , in obvious disrepair . 
the head was wrap in a turban and on top of the turban ride a great hamper across which a piece of poncho had been fling . 
the gray face stare straight ahead in the drizzle . 
moisture run_down the cheek , gather at the tip of the nose , and at the chin . 
the figure be close enough now for him to see the nose twitch to dislodge the drop cling there . 
the figure stop and one hand was perilously free from the hamper to scratch the nose . 
then the figure move_on . 
this be one of the irish woman who had build their own hut down near the river . 
they do wash . 
person recognize this one . 
he recognize her because she be the one who , in a winter twilight , on the edge of camp , had once stop him and reach down her hand to touch his fly . 
`` slice o_' mutton , bhoy '' ? she had query in her soft guttural . 
`` slice o_' mutton '' ? 
her name be person . 
they call her person , and laugh . 
look down the street after her , person see that she had again stop and again remove one hand from the basket . 
he could not make_out , but he know that again she was scratch her nose . 
person was scratch her nose . 
the word ran crazily in his head : person is scratch her nose in the rain . 
then the word fall_into a pattern : `` person is scratch her nose , scratch her nose in the rain . 
person is scratch her nose in the rain '' . 
the pattern would not stop . 
it come again_and_again . 
he feel trap in that pattern , in the repetition . 
suddenly he think he might weep . 
`` what 's the_matter with me '' ? he demand out_loud . 
he look_around wildly around , at the now empty street , at the mud , at the rain . 
`` oh , what 's the_matter with me '' ? he demand . 
when he had store his stock in the great oak chest , lock the two big hasp and secure the additional chain , tie the fly of the tent , and pick_up the cash box , he move_up the darken street . 
he would consign the cash box into the hand of person , then stand_by while his employer check the content and the list of item sell . 
then he - 
then what ? 
he did not know . 
his mind close on that prospect , as though fog had descend to blot_out a valley . 
far-off , in the dusk , he hear voice sing , muffled but strong . 
in one of the hut a group of man were huddle_together , sing . 
he stop . 
he strain to hear . 
he hear the word : `` rock_of_ages , cleave for me , let me hide myself in thee ! 
let the water and the blood from thy rive side '' . 
he think : i be a jew from bavaria . 
he was stand there , he think , in virginia , in the thickening dusk , in a costly greatcoat that had belong_to another jew . 
that other jew , a young_man too , had leave_behind that greatcoat behind , in a rich house , and march away . 
he had cross the river which now , beyond the woods yonder , was slide darkly under the mist . 
he had plunge into the dark woods beyond . 
he had die there . 
what had that man , that other young jew , feel as he stand in the twilight and hear other man , faraway , sing together ? 
. 
person think_of the hutment , regiment after regiment , row after row , the thousand of hut , stretch away into the night . 
he think_of the man , the nameless thousand , huddle in them . 
he think_of person snore on his bunk while person crouch by the hearth , skirmish an undershirt for louse , and a wet log sizzle . 
he think_of person , who once had rise at the edge of a cornfield , a maniacal scream on his lip , and swing a clubbed musket like a flail to beat down the swirl of rebel bayonet about him . 
he think_of person rise_up , fearless in glory . 
he feel the sweetness of pity flood through him , vein his very flesh . 
those man , lie in the hut , they did not know . 
they did not know who they be or know their own worth . 
in the pity for them his loneliness be gone . 
then he think_of person stand in his rich house say : `` god be tired_of take the blame . 
he is going_to let history take the blame for_a_while '' . 
he think_of the old_man laugh under the glitter of the great chandelier . 
he think : only in my heart can i make the world hang_together . 
person rise from the crouch necessary to enter the hut . 
he see person squat by the hearth , break_up hardtack into a pan . 
a pot was boil on the coal . 
`` done give person all his money '' ? 
person ask softly . 
person nod . 
`` yeah '' , person murmur , `` yeah . 
and look what he done give us '' . 
person look at the pot . 
`` what be it '' ? he ask . 
`` chicken '' , person say , and theatrically lick his lip . 
`` gre't big fat chicken , yeah '' . 
he lick his lip again . 
then : `` yeah . 
a chicken with six tit and a tail lak a corkscrew . 
and hit squeal for slop '' . 
person giggle . 
`` fool you , huh ? 
it be the same ole same , tell me hit 's name . 
it be sowbelly with tit on . 
it be salt_po'k . 
it be salt_po'k and skippers . 
that po'k , it be so full of skippers it would jump and run and not come when you say , ' hoo-pig ' . 
had_to put my foot on_it to hole it down while i cut_up it up fer the lobscuse '' . 
he dump the pan of crumbled hardtack into the boil pot of lobscouse . 
`` good_ole lobscuse '' , he mumble , and stir the pot . 
he stop stir and look over his shoulder . 
`` know what person et tonight '' ? he demand . 
`` know what i had_to fix fer ole him '' ? 
person shake his head . 
`` chicken '' , person say . 
she be a child too much a part of her environment , too eager to grow and learn and experience . 
once , they be at location for the summer ( again , person say , a good place , even though they were being rob ) . 
one soft evening - that marvelous sea blessed time when the sun 's departing warmth linger and a smell of spume and wrack haunt everything - person had pick herself off the floor and begin to walk . 
person be on the couch read ; person was sit in an easy_chair about eight foot away . 
the infant , in white terrycloth bathrobe , her face intense and purposeful , had essay a_few wobbly step toward her father . 
`` y'all wanna walk - walk '' , he say . 
then , gently , he shove her behind toward person . 
person walk - make_it halfway across the cottage floor . 
she lose not a second , pick_up herself up and continue her pilgrimage to person . 
then person take her gently and shove her off again , toward person : 
person did not laugh - this be work , concentration , achievement . 
in a_few minute she was make the ten foot hike unaided ; soon she was parade around the house , flaunt her new skill . 
some liar 's logic , a wisp of optimism as fragile as the scent of tropical blossom that come_through the window ( a euphoria perhaps engender by the pill person had give her ) , console her for a moment . 
person had_to be safe , had_to come_back to them - if only to reap that share of life 's experience that be her due , if only to give her parent another chance to do_by better by her . 
through the swathing of terror , she jab deceit 's sharp point - person would be reborn , a new child , with new parent , live under new circumstance . 
the comfort be short-lived , yet she find herself return to the assurance whenever her imagination force image on her too awful to contemplate without the prop of illusion . 
gaze at her husband 's drugged body , his chest rise and fall in mindless rhythm , she see the grandeur of his fictional world , that lush garden from which he pluck flower and herb . 
she envy him . 
she admire him . 
in the darkness , she see him stir . 
he seem to be mutter , his voice surprisingly clear . 
`` y'all should have let me take_out that money out '' , person say . 
`` ' another minute i 'd have be fine . 
y'all should have let me do it '' . 
person touch his hand . 
`` yes , i know , person . 
i should have '' . 
the heat intensify on tuesday . 
location gasp and blink under an autumn hot_spell , dry , more enervating , more laden with man 's contrived impurity than the worst day of the summer past . 
it could continue this way , hit 106 and more in the location , person know , into october . 
he and person were sip coffee at the breakfast bar . 
both had be up since 7 : 00 - person on the early morning watch , person unable to sleep during his four hour relief . 
the night before , they had telephone the person , person , and she had arrive early , burst her vigorous presence into the silent house with an assurance that amuse person and confound person . 
the latter , thank her for the coffee , had wink and mutter , `` sure_'_nuff , honey '' . 
person be the wrong woman for these crudity . 
with a hard eye , she inform person : `` do n't sure_'_nuff me , officer . 
i'm honey only to my husband , understand '' ? 
person understand . 
the maid be very black and very energetic , trim in a yellow pique uniform . 
her speech be barren_of southernism ; she be one of person 's neutralized minority , adopt the rolling r 's and constricted vowel of location . 
not see her dark intelligent face , one would have gauge the voice as that of a location matron , ten year out of location . 
after she had serve the detective coffee and toast ( they politely decline eggs , uncomfortable about their tenancy ) , she settle_down with a morning newspaper and begin read the stock_market quotation . 
while she was thus engage , person question her about her whereabouts the previous day , any recollection she have of people hang_around , of overcurious delivery_boy or repairman , of strange car cruise the neighborhood . 
she answer him precisely , miss not a beat in her scrutiny of the financial report . 
person , person realize , be her own woman . 
she be the only kind of negro person would want around : independent , unservile , probably charge double what ordinary maid did for housework - and doubly efficient . 
when the parent emerge from the bedroom a_few minute later , the maid greet them quietly . 
`` i'm awful sorry about what 's happen '' , person say . 
`` maybe today 'll be a good news day '' . 
she charge off to the bedroom . 
person take his coffee into the nursery . 
during the night , a phone_company technician had deaden the bell and install red blinker on the phone . 
someone would have_to remain in the office continually . 
person greet the parent , then study his notebook . 
he wanted to take the mother to headquarters at_once and start her on the mug_file . 
`` sleep well '' ? he ask . 
person did not answer him . 
his face be bloated with drugging , red than normal . 
the woman have the glassy look of an invalid , as if she had not sleep at_all . 
`` oh - we manage '' , she say . 
`` i'm a_little groggy . 
did anything happen during the night '' ? 
`` few crank_call '' , person say . 
`` a_couple_of tip we 're run_down - nothing promising . 
we can expect more of the same . 
too bad your number be in the directory '' . 
`` did n't occur to me my child would be kidnap when i have it list '' , person mutter . 
he settle_on the sofa with his coffee , warm his hand on the cup , although the room be heavy with heat . 
the three have little to say to each other . 
the previous night 's horror - the absolute failure , overcast with the intrusion of the press , had leave them all with a wan sense of uselessness , of playacting . 
sip their coffee , discuss the weather , the day 's shopping , person 's commitment at the network ( all of which he would cancel ) , they avoid the radio , the morning tv news_show , even the front page of the santa_luisa_register , rest on the kitchen bar . 
kidnapper spurn ransom ; person still missing . 
once , person walk by it , hastily scan the bold black headline and the five column lead of the article ( by person , staff correspondent - age not give ) , and mutter : `` we a bunch national celebrity '' . 
person tell the parent he would escort them to police_headquarters in a half hour . 
before that , he wanted to talk to the neighbor . 
he did not want_to bring the person to the station_house too early - person had summon a press_conference , and he did n't want them subject to the reporter again . 
he could think_of nothing else to tell them : no assurance , no hopeful hint at great discovery that day . 
when the detective leave , person phone his secretary to cancel his work and to advise the network to get a substitute director for his current project . 
person was talk to the maid , arrange for her to come in every_day , instead of the four day she now work . 
outside , only a handful of reporter remain . 
the bulk of the press_corps was cover person 's conference . 
in_contrast to the caravan of the previous night , there be only four car parked across the street . 
two man he did not recognize were sip coffee and munch sweet_roll . 
he did not see person , or person , or person , or any of the feverish crew that had so harass him twelve hour ago . 
however , the litter remain , augment by several dozen lunchroom supper . 
the street_cleaner had not_yet be around . 
one of the reporter call to him : `` anything new , person '' ? 
and he ignore him , skirt the parked car and walk up the path to the person house . 
when person be halfway to the door , the proprietor emerge - a mountainous , dark man , his head thick_with resiny black hair , his eye like two of the black_olive he import in boatload . 
person identify himself . 
the master of the house , his nourished face unrevealing , consent to postpone his departure a_few minute to talk to the detective . 
inside , as_soon_as person had disclose - in a hoarse whisper - the detective 's errand , his family gather in a huddle , form a mass of dark flesh on and around a brocaded sofa which stand at one side of a baroque fireplace . 
flank by marble urn and alabaster lamp , they seem to be pose for a tribal portrait . 
it be amazing how they had herd together for protection : an enormous matriarch in a quilted silk wrapper , rise from the breakfast_table ; a gross boy in his teens , shuffle in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hand ; a girl in her twenties , fat and sullen , descend the marble staircase ; then all four gather on the sofa to face the inquisitor . 
they answer him in monosyllable , nod , occasionally mutter in greek to one another , await the word from person , who restlessly crack his knuckle , anxious to stuff himself into his white cadillac and burst off to the freeway . 
no , they had n't see anyone around ; no , they did n't know the person family ; yes , they had read about the case ; yes , they had let some reporter use their phone , but they would no_longer . 
they offer no opinion , volunteer nothing , betray no emotion . 
study them , person could not help make comparison with the person couple . 
the person people seem to him of that breed of human_being whose insularity free them from tragedy . 
he imagine they be the kind whose tax_return were never examine ( if they were , they were never penalize ) , whose child have no unhappy romance , whose name never know scandal . 
the equation be simple : wealth bring them happiness , and their united front to the world be their warning that they mean to keep everything they have , let_in no_one in on the secret . 
by comparison , person and person be quiver fledgling . 
they possess no outer fortification , no hard shell of confidence ; they have enough difficulty get from day to day , let_alone having an awful crime thrust upon them . 
person express no curiosity over the case , offer no expression of sympathy , make no move to escort person to the door . 
all four remain impacted on the sofa until he had leave . 
he had speak_to person the previous day . 
there remain a family name person , owner of a two story tudor style house on the south_side of the person home . 
their name had not come_up in any discussion with person , and he have no idea what they would be like . 
person note the immaculate lawn and garden : each blade of grass cropped , bright and firm ; each shrub glaze with good_health . 
the door was answer by a slender man in his sixties - straight-backed , somewhat clerical in manner , wear rimless glasses . 
when person identify himself , he nod , unsmiling , and usher him into a sedate living_room . 
person join them . 
she have a dried-out quality - a gray , lean woman , not unattractive . 
both be dressed rather formally . 
the man wear a vest and a tie , the woman have_on a dark green dress and three strand of pearl . 
`` funny thing '' , person say , when they be seated , `` when i hear you ring , i figure it was that guy down the block , person '' . 
person look puzzled . 
person continue : `` i fix his dog the other day and i guess he be sore , so i expect him to come barge_in '' . 
person go_on to explain how person 's fox_terrier had been `` make '' in his flowerbed . 
the dog refuse to be scare_off , so person had purchase some small firecracker . 
he would lie in wait in the garage , and when the terrier come scratch around , he 'd let_fly with a cherry_bomb . 
`` scare the hell out of him '' , person grin . 
`` i hit him in the ass once '' . 
both grin at the detective . 
`` finally , all i need be to throw a little piece of red wood that look_like a firecracker and that dumb dog would run ki-yi-ing for his life '' . 
in the dim underwater light they dress and straighten up the room , and then they go across the hall to the kitchen . 
she was intimidate by the stove . 
he find the pilot_light and turn_on one of the burner for her . 
the gas flame_up two inch high . 
they find the teakettle and put water on to boil and then search through the icebox . 
several section of a loaf of dark_bread ; butter ; jam ; a tiny cake of ice . 
in their search for what turn_out to be the right breakfast china but the wrong table silver , they open every cupboard door in the kitchen and pantry . 
while she was settle the teacart , he go_back across the hall to their bedroom , open one of the suitcase , and take_out powdered coffee and sugar . 
she appear with the teacart and he open the window . 
`` do you want to call person '' ? 
he did n't , but it be not really a question , and so he leave the room , walk down the hall to the front of the apartment , hesitate , and then knock lightly on the closed door of the study . 
a sleepy voice answer . 
`` le petit_dejeuner '' , person say , in an accent that do credit to person , his high_school french_teacher . 
at_the_same_time , his voice betray uncertainty about their be here , and convey an appeal to whatever be reasonable , peace-loving , and dependable in everybody . 
since ordinary breakfast_table conversation be impossible , it was at_least something that they be able to offer person the sugar_bowl with their sugar in it , and the plate of bread_and_butter , and that person could return the pitcher of hot milk to them handle first . 
person put a spoonful of powdered coffee into his cup and then fill it with hot water . 
stir , he say : `` i be sorry that my work prevent me from doing anything with you today '' . 
they assure him that they did not expect or need to be entertain . 
person put a teaspoonful of powdered coffee in his cup and fill it with hot water , and then , stir , he sit_back in his chair . 
the chair creak . 
every time he move or say something , the chair creak again . 
person be not entirely silent , or openly rude - unless ask person to move to another chair and place himself in the fauteuil that creak so alarmingly be an act of rudeness . 
it go_on right on creak under his own considerable weight , and all it need , person think , be for somebody to fling himself back in a fit of laughter and that would be the end of_it . 
through the open window they hear sound below in the street : cartwheel , a tired horse 's plodding step , voice . 
person indicate the photograph on the wall and ask what church the stone sculpture be in . 
person tell him and he promptly forget . 
they pass the marmalade , the bread , the black-market butter , back_and_forth . 
nothing was say about hotel or train journey . 
person offer person his car , to use at any time he care to , and when this offer was not accept , the armchair creak . 
they all three have another cup of coffee . 
person be in his pajamas and dressing_gown , and on his large foot he wear yellow turkish slipper that turn_up at the toe . 
`` excuse me '' , he say in berlitz_english , and get_up and leave them , to bathe and dress . 
the first shrill ring of the telephone bring person out into the hall . 
he realize that he have no idea where the telephone be . 
at that moment the bathroom door fly_open and person come_out , with his face lather for shaving , and stride down the hall , tie the sash of his dressing_gown as he go . 
the telephone be in the study but the ringing come from the hall . 
between the telephone and the wall_plug there be sixty foot of cord , and when the conversation come to an end , person carry the instrument with him the whole length of the apartment , to his bathroom , where it ring three more time while he was shaving and in the tub . 
before he leave the apartment he knock on their door and ask if there be anything he could do for them . 
person shake his head . 
`` person call a_few minute ago '' , person say . 
`` she want you and person to have dinner with her tomorrow night '' . 
he hand person a key to the front_door , and caution him against leave it unlocked while they be out of the apartment . 
when enough time had elapse so_that there be little likelihood of his return for something he had forget , person go_out into the hall and stand look into one room after another . 
in the room next to theirs be a huge cradle , of mahogany , ornately carve and decorate with gold_leaf . 
it be the most important-looking cradle he had ever see . 
then come their bathroom , and then a bedroom that , judge by the photograph on the wall , must belong_to person . 
a young_woman who look_like person , with her two child . 
person and person on their wedding_day . 
matching photograph in oval frame of person and an elderly man who must be person 's grandfather . 
person , considerably young and very different . 
the schoolboy . 
and a gray-haired man whose glance - direct , lifelike , and mildly accusing - was contradict by the gilt and black frame . 
it be the kind of frame that is only put around the photograph of a dead_person . 
person , could it be ? 
with the metal shutter closed , the dining_room be so dark that it seem still night in there . 
one of the drawing_room shutter be partly open and he make_out the shape of chair and sofa , which seem to be upholster in brown or russet velvet . 
the curtain be of the same material , and there be some big oil_painting - portrait in the style of person and person . 
though , take individually , the big room be , or seem to be , square , the apartment as a whole form a triangle . 
the apex , the study where person sleep , be light and bright and airy and cheerful . 
the window look_out_on the location - it be the only window of the apartment that did . 
look_around slowly , he see a marble fireplace , a desk , a low bookcase of mahogany with crisscrossed brass wire instead of glass pane in the door . 
the daybed person had sleep in , make_up now with its dark-brown velours cover and pillow . 
the portable record_player with a pile of classical record beside it . 
person 's fifth be the one on top . 
da-da-da-dum . 
music could not be person 's passion . 
besides , the record be dusty . 
he try the door of the bookcase . 
lock . 
the title he could read easily through the crisscrossed wire : work on theology , astral physics , history , biology , political_science . 
no poetry . 
no novel . 
he move_over to the desk and stand look at the paper on_it but not touch anything . 
the clock on the mantel was scandalize and tick so loudly that he glance at it over his shoulder and then quickly leave the room . 
the concierge call_out to them as they were pass_through the foyer . 
her quarters be on the right as you walk into the building , and her small front_room was clog with heavy furniture - a big , round , oak dining_table and chair , a buffet , with a row of unclaimed letter insert between the mirror and its frame . 
the suitcase had come while they be out , and had been put in their room , the concierge say . 
he wait until they be inside the elevator and then say : `` now what do we do '' ? 
`` call the person , i guess '' . 
`` i guess '' . 
rather_than sit around wait for the suitcase to be deliver , they had go sightseeing . 
they go to the flea_market , expect to find the treasure of location , and find instead a duplication of that long double row of booth in location . 
cheap clothing and junk of every sort , as far as the eye could see . 
they look , even_so . 
look at everything . 
person buy some cotton apron , and person buy shoestring . 
they have lunch at a sidewalk cafe overlook the intersection of two broad , busy , unpicturesque street , and come home they get lost in the metro ; it take them over an hour to get_back to the station where they should have change , in_order to take the line that go to the location . 
it be the end of the afternoon when he take the huge key out of his pocket and insert it into the keyhole . 
when he open the door , there stand person , on his way out_of the apartment . 
he was wear sneaker and shorts and an open-collared shirt , and in his hand he carry a little black bag . 
he did not explain where he was go , and they did not ask . 
instead , they go_on down the hall to their room . 
`` do you think he could be have an affair '' ? 
person ask , as they hear the front_door close . 
`` oh_no '' , person say , shock . 
`` well , this be france , after_all '' . 
`` i know , but there must be some other explanation . 
he 's probably spend the evening with friend '' . 
`` and for that he need a little bag '' ? 
they go shopping in the neighborhood , and buy two loaf_of_bread with the ration coupon they had been give in location , and some cheese , and a dozen eggs , and a bag of orange from a peddler in the location - the first orange they had see since they land . 
they have vermouth , sit in_front_of a cafe . 
when they get home person be grateful for the stillness in the apartment , and think how , under different circumstance , they might have stay_on here , in these old-fashioned , high-ceilinged room that remind him of the person ' apartment in the location . 
they could have be perfectly happy here for ten whole day . 
he go down the hall to person 's bathroom , to turn_on the hot-water_heater , and on the side of the tub he see a pair of blue wool swimming_trunks . 
he feel them . 
they be damp . 
he reach_out and feel the bath_towel hang_on the towel_rack over the tub . 
damp also . 
he look_around the room and then call_out : 
`` come here , quick '' ? 
`` what be it '' ? 
person ask , stand in the doorway . 
`` i 've solve the mystery of the little bag . 
there it be * * h and there be what be in it . 
but where do people go swim in location ? 
that boat in the river , maybe '' . 
`` what boat '' ? 
`` there 's a big boat anchor near the location , with a swimming_pool in it - did n't you notice it ? 
but if he have time to go swim , he have time to be with us '' . 
she look at him in surprise . 
`` i know '' , he say , read her mind . 
`` i do n't know what i'm going_to do with you '' . 
`` it 's because we be in location '' , he say , `` and know so few people . 
so something like this matter more_than it would at home . 
also , he be so nice when he be nice '' . 
`` all because i did n't feel_like dance '' . 
`` i do n't think it be that , really '' . 
`` then what be it '' ? 
`` i do n't know . 
i wish i did . 
the tweed coat , maybe . 
the thing about person be that he 's very proud '' . 
and the thing about hurt feelings , the wet bathing_suit point_out , be that the person who have them be not quite the innocent party he believe himself to be . 
for_instance - what about all those people person go toward unhesitatingly , as if this be the one moment they would ever have together , their one chance of know each other ? 
fortunately , the embarrassing question raise by object do not need to be answer , or we would all have_to go sleep in the open field . 
and in_any_case , answer may clarify but they do not change anything . 
he bring with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes , of about a_hundred pound ' weight . 
they take jesus 's body , then , and wrap it in winding-clothes with the spice ; that is how the jew prepare a body for burial . 
list as present at the descent be person , person 's sister , mary_magdalene , person , person , person . 
search as he might , he could find no place where the bible speak of a moment when person could have be alone with jesus . 
mostly the scene be crowded with mourner , such_as the dramatic dell'arca_lamentation in location , where the grief-stricken spectator had usurp person 's last poignant moment . 
in his concept there could be no_one else present . 
his first desire be to create a mother and son alone in the universe . 
when might person have have that moment to hold her child on her lap ? 
perhaps after the soldier had lay him on the ground , while person be at person 's ask for christ 's body , person was gather his mixture of myrrh and aloes , and the others had go_home to mourn . 
those who see his finished pieta would take the place of the biblical witness . 
they would feel what person was undergo . 
there would be no halo , no angel . 
these would be two human_being , whom god had choose . 
he feel close to person , having spend so long concentrate_on the beginning of her journey . 
now she be intensely alive , anguished ; her son be dead . 
even_though he would later be resurrect , he be at this moment dead indeed , the expression on his face reflect what he had go_through on the cross . 
in his sculpture therefore it would not be possible for him to project anything of what jesus feel for his mother ; only what person feel for her son . 
jesus ' inert body would be passive , his eye closed . 
person would have_to carry the human communication . 
this seem right to him . 
it be a relief to shift in his mind to technical problem . 
since his christ was to be life-size , how was person to hold him on her lap without the relationship seem ungainly ? 
his person would be slender of limb and delicate of proportion , yet she must hold this full-grown man as securely and convincingly as she would a child . 
there be only one way to accomplish this : by design , by draw diagram and sketch in which he probe the remote corner of his mind for creative idea to carry his concept . 
he start by make free sketch to loosen_up his thinking so_that image would appear on paper . 
visually , these approximate what he was feel within himself . 
at_the_same_time he start walk the street , peer at the people pass or shop_at the stall , store up fresh impression of what they look_like , how they move . 
in_particular he seek the gentle , sweet-faced nun , with head_covering and veil come to the middle of their forehead , remember their expression until he reach home and set_down them down on paper . 
discover that drapery could be design to serve structural purpose , he begin a study of the anatomy of fold . 
he improvise as he go_along , complete a life-size clay figure , then buy yard of an inexpensive material from a draper , wet the lightweight cloth in a basin and cover it over with clay that person bring from the bank of the tiber , to the consistency of thick mud . 
no fold could be accidental , each turn of the drapery had to serve organically , to cover the person 's slender leg and foot so that they would give substantive support to christ 's body , to intensify her inner turmoil . 
when the cloth dry and stiffen , he see what adjustment had to be make . 
`` so that 's sculpture '' , comment person wryly , when he had sluice down the floor for a week , `` make mud pie '' . 
person grin . 
`` see , person , if you control the way these fold are bunch , like this , or make to flow , you can enrich the body attitude . 
they can have as much tactile appeal as flesh_and_bone '' . 
he go_into the location , want to draw hebraic face so_that he could reach a visual understanding of how christ might have look . 
the jewish section be in location , near the tiber at the church of group . 
the colony had be small until the spanish_inquisition_of_1492 drive many jew into location . 
here , for_the_most_part , they were well treat , as a `` reminder of the old_testament heritage of christianity '' ; many_of their gifted member be prominent in the vatican as physician , musician , banker . 
the man did not object to his sketch them while they go_about their work , but no_one could be persuade to come to his studio to pose . 
he was tell to ask for person at the synagogue on saturday afternoon . 
person find the rabbi in the room of study , a gentle old_man with a white beard and luminous grey eye , robe in black gabardine with a skullcap on his head . 
he was read from the talmud with a group of man from his congregation . 
when person explain why he had come , person reply gravely : 
`` the bible forbid us to bow_down to or to make graven_image . 
that is why our creative people give their time to literature , not to painting or sculpture '' . 
`` but , person , you do n't object to others create work_of_art '' ? 
`` not at all . 
each religion have its own tenet '' . 
`` i am carve a pieta from white location marble . 
i wish to make jesus an authentic jew . 
i cannot accomplish this if you will not help me '' . 
the rabbi say thoughtfully , `` i would not want my people to get_in trouble with the church '' . 
`` i am work for the cardinal of location . 
i'm sure he would approve '' . 
`` what kind of model would you prefer '' ? 
`` workman . 
in their mid-thirties . 
not bulky laborer , but sinewy man . 
with intelligence . 
and sensitivity '' . 
person smile at him with infinitely old but merry eye . 
`` leave me your address . 
i will send you the best the quarter have to offer '' . 
person hurry to person 's solitary bachelor room with his sketch , ask the architect to design a stand which would simulate the seated person . 
person study the drawing and improvise a trestle couch . 
person buy some scrap lumber . 
together he and person build the stand , cover it with blanket . 
his first model arrive at dusk . 
he hesitate for a moment when person ask him to disrobe , so person give him a piece of toweling to wrap around his loins , lead him to the kitchen to take_off his clothes . 
he then drape him over the rough stand , explain that he be supposed to be recently dead , and was being hold on his mother 's lap . 
the model quite plainly think person crazy ; only the instruction from his rabbi keep him from bolt . 
but at the end of the sitting , when person show him the quick , free drawing , with the mother rough in , hold her son , the model grasp what person be_after , and promise to speak_to his friend . 
he work for two hour a day with each model send by the rabbi . 
person present quite a different problem . 
though this sculpture must take_place thirty-three years after her moment of decision , he could not conceive_of her as a woman in her mid-fifties , old , wrinkled , broken in body and face by labor or worry . 
his image of the_virgin had always be that of a young_woman , even as had his memory of his mother . 
person introduce him into several roman home . 
here he sketch , sit in their flowing gown of linen and silk , young_girl not_yet twenty , some about to be marry , some married a year or two . 
since the group had take only man , he had have no experience in the study of female anatomy ; but he had sketch the woman of location in their field and home . 
he be able to discern the body line of the roman woman under their robe . 
he spend concentrated week put his two figure together : a person who would be young and sensitive , yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap ; and a jesus who , though lean , be strong even in death - a look he remember well from his experience in the dead_room of group . 
he draw toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory , without need to consult his sketch . 
soon he be ready to go into a three-dimensional_figure in clay . 
here he would have free expression because the material could be move to distort form . 
when he wanted to emphasize , or get great intensity , he add or subtract clay . 
next he turn_to wax because there be a similarity of wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence . 
he respect each of these approach technique , and keep them in character : 
his quill drawing have a scratchiness , suggest skin texture ; the clay he use plastically to suggest soft moving flesh , as in an abdomen , in a reclining torso ; the wax he smooth_over to give the body surface an elastic pull . 
yet he never allow these model to become fixed in his mind ; they remain rough starting_point . 
when carve he be charged with spontaneous energy ; too-careful or detailed study in clay and wax would have glue him down to a mere enlarge of his model . 
the true surge had to be inside the marble itself . 
drawing and model be his thinking . 
carve be action . 
the arrangement with person was work well , except that sometimes person could not figure who be master and who apprentice . 
person had been train so rigorously by the jesuit that person be unable to change his habit : up before dawn to scrub the floor , whether they be dirty or not ; water boil on the fire for wash laundry every_day , the pot scour with river sand after each meal . 
`` person , this be senseless '' , he complain , not like to work on the wet floor , particularly in cold_weather . 
`` you be too clean . 
scrub the studio once a week . 
that 's enough '' . 
`` no '' , say person stolidly . 
`` every_day . 
before dawn . 
i was teach '' . 
`` and god help anyone who try to unteach you '' ! 
grumble person ; yet he know that he have nothing to grumble about , for person make few demand on him . 
the boy was become acquainted_with the contadini family that bring produce into location . 
on sunday he would walk mile into the campagna to visit with them , and in_particular to see their horse . 
the one thing he miss from his farm in the location be the animal ; frequently he would take_leave his leave of person by announce : 
`` today i go see the horse '' . 
it take a piece of bad_luck to show person that the boy be devoted to him . 
he was crouch over his anvil in the courtyard get his chisel into trim , when a splinter of steel fly into his eye and imbed itself in his pupil . 
he stumble into the house , eye burn like fire . 
person make him lie_down on the bed , bring a pan of hot water , dip some clean white linen cloth and apply it to extract the splinter . 
though the pain be considerable person be not too concerned . 
he assume he could blink the splinter out . 
but it would not come_out . 
person never leave his side , keep the water boil , apply hot compress throughout the night . 
by the second day person begin to worry ; and by the second night he be in a state of panic : he could see nothing out of the afflicted eye . 
at dawn person go_to person . 
person arrive with his family surgeon , person . 
the surgeon carry a cage of live pigeon . 
he tell person to take a bird out of the cage , cut a large vein under its wing , let the blood gush into person 's injured eye . 
the surgeon come_back at dusk , cut the vein of a second pigeon , again wash out the eye . 
person be very still and her breath come in small jerking gasp . 
the thin leg twitch convulsively once , then person feel the little body stiffen in her arm and hear one strangled sound . 
the scant flesh grow cool beneath her frantic hand . 
the child be gone . 
when person awake , person was still rock the dead child , still croon in disbelief , `` no , no , oh , no ! '' 
they put person to bed and wire person and send_for the young presbyterian minister . 
he sit beside person 's bed with the others throughout the morning , talk , talk of god 's will , while person lie stare angrily at him . 
when he tell her god had call the child to him , she reject his word rebelliously . 
few of the neighbor come , but person come , call by tragedy . 
`` it always come in three '' , she sigh heavily . 
`` trouble never come but in three '' . 
they hold the funeral the next morning from the crossroads church and bury the little box in the quiet family plot . 
person move through all the preparation and service in a state of bewilderment . 
she would not accept the death of such a little child . 
`` god call her to him '' , the minister had say . 
god would not do that , person think stubbornly . 
person 's letter come , as she know it would , and he had accept their child 's death as another judgment from god against both person and himself . 
in blind panic of grief she accept person 's dictum , and believe in her desperation that she had been curse by god . 
she hold person 's letter , his word burn like a brand , and know suddenly that the bond between them were sever . 
she have nothing left but her duty to his land and his son . 
person come and sit mutely with her , share her pain and anguish , avert his eye from the ice_pack on her bosom . 
person and person keep person in bed a week until her milk dry . 
when she return to life in the big house she feel shriveled of all emotion save dedication to duty . 
she discipline herself daily to do what must be do . 
she had even steel herself to keep person upstairs in the nurse 's room off the empty nursery , although the girl try to insist on move_back to the quarters to spare person remembrance of the baby 's death . 
person droop about the place , wear a haunted , brooding look , which person attribute to the baby 's death , until the day a letter come for her addressed to `` person '' , bear a location postmark . 
see the slanting hand , person know uneasily that it was from the yankee colonel . 
the federal force had take location and location from the rebel and were move to take all the mountain . 
person try to contain her curiosity and foreboding at what the letter portend , at what involvement exist for person . 
person and person had replant the bottomland with difficulty , for more of the slave , include person , had sneak_off when the soldier break_camp . 
person work like a fieldhand in the afternoon after school . 
he had be at lesson in the schoolhouse since they return from location . 
person feel she had desert the boy in her own loss . 
she love him and miss his company . 
person had been ride out every evening on some secret business of his own . 
what it be person could not fathom . 
he claim to be visit the waterfront saloon at the crossroads to play card and drink with his crony , but person had not smell brandy on him since person 's funeral . 
person know what he was_about , however . 
`` you 're gonna get catch '' , she hear person say to person by the pump one morning . 
`` not this old fox '' , chuckle person . 
`` everybody know i'm just a harmless , deaf old_man who take_to drink . 
i aim to keep a_little whisky still back in the ridge for my pleasure '' . 
`` whisky still , my_foot '' , say person . 
`` you 're back there ride with the guerrilla , the group '' . 
`` hush '' , say person , smile , `` or i 'll give you another black_eye '' . 
he pat the eye person had have blacken in a fight over be rebel at the crossroads some day back . 
person have no idea what they were talk of , although she had see the blue light and strange fire burn and wink on the ridge at night , had hear horseman on the location and hill trail through the night till dawn . 
stranger , person begin ride home night with a jug strap to his saddle , drunkenly sing `` old_dan_tucker '' at the top of his voice . 
hear his voice ring raucously up from the road , person would await him anxiously and watch perplexed as he walk into the house , cold_sober . 
what he was_about become clear to her with the circulation of another broadside proclamation by person , threaten reprisal against rebel guerrilla . 
she be taken_up in worry for the reckless old_man . 
person drew more_and_more on her affection for person through the hot day of summer work . 
she had take_out him out of the schoolhouse and close the school for the summer , after she see person crack person across the face with a ruler for let a snake loose in the schoolroom . 
person had walk past the school on her morning chore and had see the whole incident , had see person 's burning humiliation before person 's cold , bespectacled wrath . 
he have the hard pains of grow before him now , as he approach twelve . 
these would be his hard years , she know , and he miss his father desperately . 
she try to find some way to draw_out him out , to help him . 
whenever she find time , she go blackberry pick with him , and they would come home together , mouth purple , arm and face scratched , tire enough to forget grief for another day . 
he tend the new colt person had sire . 
he help person and person enlarge the flower_garden in the side_yard , where they sometimes sit in the still evening watch the last fat bee work against the summer 's purple dusk . 
no one go much to the crossroads now except person . 
they stay in their own world on the bluff , wait for letter and the peddler , bring the news . 
person write grimly of the destruction of location before they abandon it ; of their first engagement at location after person 's group had destroy all the rolling_stock of the group . 
the men be restive , he write , ready to take the battle to the enemy as person wish . 
the peddler come bawl his wares and tell them of the convention in location , which had form a new state_government by declare the government at location in the east illegal because they be traitor .

when person hurry in alarm to tell him to put_out it out , she see other dot of flame among the western virginia hills from the few scattered fire of the faithful .

`` no , the decision be yours . 
i have hold your papers of manumission since i marry person '' . 
the red glow from the cove had die_out of the sky . 
the two in the bed know each other as old people know the partner with whom they have share the same bed for many years , and they needed to say no_more . 
the thing leave unsaid they both feel deeply , and with a sigh they fall_back on the well stuffed pillow . 
person put_out the remaining candle with a long snuffer , and in the smell of scented candlewick , the comforting awareness of each other 's body , the retained pattern of dancer and guest remember , their mind grow numb and then empty_of image . 
they sleep - person with a marvelously high-pitched snoring , the damn seahorse ivory tooth watch him from a bedside table . 
in the ballroom below , the dark had give_way to moonlight come_in through the bank of french_window . 
it be a delayed moon , but now the sky had clear of scud black and the star sugar the silver_gray sky . 
person , old , slow , careful of foot , come_down the great staircase , dressed in her best lace-drawn black silk , her jeweled shoe buckle hold forward . 
`` well , i'm here at_last '' , she say , address the old portrait on the wall . 
`` i do n't hear the music . 
i am get deaf , i must admit it '' . 
she come to the ballroom and stand on the two carpeted steps that lead down to it . 
`` where be everyone ? 
i_say , where be everyone ? 
person , you lummox , you 've forget to order the musician '' . 
she stand there , a large old_woman , smile at the thing she would say to him in the morning , this big foolish baby of a son . 
there be time now , like this , when she lose_control of the time count and move freely back_and_forth into three generation . 
be it a birthday ball ? 
when person had reach his majority at eighteen ? 
or be it her own first ball as mistress of this big house , a location bride from way upstate near albany , from location . 
and this handsome booby , stare and sweat , be he her bridegroom ?

he had ride hard from boston , and he be not used_to horseback . 
now , drive the horse and sulky borrow from person , he feel as if every bone was topped by burning oil and that every muscle be ready to dissolve into jelly and leave his big body helpless and unable to move . 
the road lead south along the river be shaded with old tree , and in the moonlight the silvery landscape be like a setting for troll and wood god rather_than the hudson_river valley of his boyhood memory . 
he slap the rein on the back of the powerful gray horse and hold_on as the sulky 's wheel hit a pothole and come_out with a jolt and go_on . 
he would cross to manhattan , to location , before morning . 
there a certain farmhouse be a station for the group . 
he would send_on by trusted messenger the dispatch with their electrifying news . 
and he would sleep , sleep , and never think_of road and horse ' sore haunch , of colonial war . 
strange how everything here fit back into his life , even if he had be away so long . 
person , person , the valley society , the very smell of the river on his right purl along to the bay past fish weir and rock , and ahead the sleepy ribbon of moon drenched road . 
a mist was walking on the water , white as cotton , but with a blending and merging grace . 
ahead there be a stirring of sudden movement at a crossroad . 
person reach for the pair of pistol in the saddlebag at his foot . 
he pull_out one of them and cock it . 
a strange wood creature come float up from a patch of berry bush . 
it be a grotesque hen , five or six foot tall . 
it have the feature of a man bewhiskered by clump of loose feather . 
it run , this apocalyptic beast , on two thin leg , and its wing - be they feathered arm ? 
- flap as it run . 
its groin be bloody . 
black strip of skin hang from it . 
the horse shy at the dreadful thing and flare its nostrils . 
person took_a_firm_hand with it . 
the creature in feather look_around and person see the mad eye , glaze with an insane fear . 
the ungainly bird thing run_away , and to person its croaking sound like the crow of a tormented rooster . 
then it be go . 
he drive on , wary and shaken . 
the group be out tonight . 
new_york lie bleach in the summer sun , and the morning fish_hawk , fly in the heated air , see below him the long triangular wedge of location . 
it be thickly_settled by fifteen thousand citizen and lay_out into pig infested street , mostly around the location , go bravely north to wall_street , but give_up and become field and farm in the region of location . 
from there it look_across at location and the hudson_river where the manor_house , estate , and big farm of the original ( non indian ) landowner begin . 
on the east_side of the island of manhattan the indifferent hawk know the location that connect new_york_bay with long_island_sound . 
on the western tip of long_island protrude location . 
it command a view over manhattan and the harbor . 
a fringe of housing and garden beard the top of the heights , and behind it be sandy road lead past farm and hayfield . 
husbandry was bound by snake-rail_fence , and there be graze cattle . 
on the shore north and south , the fisher and mooncurser - smuggler - live along the churning location and the narrow barrier of sand , location . 
the morning hawk , hungry for any eatable , killable , digestible item , keep his eye on the ring of anchor ship that lie off the shore in the bay , sheltered by the new_jersey inlet . 
they often throw tidbit overboard . 
the larger ship be near location , already be called , by a_few , location . 
these be the ship of his person 's navy , herd the hulk of the location merchant and the yacht and ketch of the loyalist . 
the news of battle on location had already seep through , and new_york itself was now leave in the hands of the local group . 
the fish_hawk , his wing not move , circle and glide low . 
the gilt stern of the man-of-war become clear to him , the side of the wooden sea wall alternately painted yellow and black , the bronze cannon at the port . 
the captain 's gig of h.m.s._mercury was being row to h.m.s._neptune . 
on shore `` the freed slave to despotism '' - the town dweller - watch the ship and wait . 
the chevaux-de-frise , those sharp stake and barrier around the fort at the location , point to a conflict between the town and sea_power roll in glassy swell as the tide come_in . 
across the bay the location be heavy in green timber ; their rock path lead down to the hudson . 
below in the open bay face manhattan be staten_island , gritty with clamshell and mud_flat behind which nest farm , cattle barn , and berry thicket . 
along location in location , past the white church at location , past location on the east bank of the hudson , to the white salt crusted road of the location there be a watching and an activity of prepare_for something explosive to happen . 
today , tomorrow , six month , even perhaps a year . 
the fish_hawk fly_on and be lose from sight . 
the british ship roll at anchor , send_out picket_boat and wait for order from location . 
wait for more ship , more lobster-backed infantry , and ask what was to be done with a war of rebellion ? 
person , having sleep away a day and a night , come awake in a plank farmhouse on the location near location . 
he look_out through windowpane turn a faint violet by sun and weather , look_out at location toward location . 
the road seem animated with a few more wagon than usual ; a carriage raise_up the choking june dust , and beyond , in a meadow , a local militia company drill with musket , kentuck ' rifle , every kind of horse pistol , old sword , or cutlass . 
the wraithlike event of the last few day flood person 's mind and he rub his unshaved chin and feel again the ache in his kidney cause by his saddle odyssey from boston . 
pensive , introspective , he ache . 
he had send the dispatch downtown to the proper people and had sleep . 
now there be more to do . 
order not write_down had_to be transmit to the local provincial government . 
he scratch his mosquito plagued neck . 
from the saddlebag , hang_on a hitchcock_chair , person take_out a good english razor , a present from person . 
he find tepid water in a pitcher and a last bite of soap , and he lather his face and stand strop the razor on his broad leather belt , its buckle hold firm by a knob of the bedpost . 
he hope he be free_of self-deception . 
here he be , suddenly caught_up in the delirium of a war , in the spite and calumny of whig and tory . 
there would be great need soon for his skill as surgeon , but somehow he had not plan to use his knowledge merely for war . 
person have certain psychic intuition that this rebellion be not wholly what it appear on the surface . 
he know that many were use it for their own end . 
but it did not matter . 
he strop the razor slowly ; what matter was that a new concept of american was be born . 
that some man did not want it he could understand . 
the moral aridity of merchant make them loyal usually to their ledger . 
yet some , like person , would bankrupt themselves for the new idea . 
unique circumstance would test us all , he decide . 
injury and ingratitude would occur . 
no_doubt person would do well now ; war be a smuggler ' heaven . 
and what of that poor tarred-and-feathered wretch he had see on the road drive down from person 's ? 
thing like that would increase rather_than be do_away_with . 
one had_to believe_in final event or one was strand in the abyss of nothing . 
he see with person now that the perfectability of man be a dream . 
life be a short play of tenebrous shadow . 
person begin to shave with great sweeping stroke . 
time play an essential part in our mortality , and suddenly for no reason he could imagine ( or admit ) the image of person laugh fill his mind - so desirable , so lusty , so full of nuance of pleasure and joy . 
he drive_off sensual pattern off , carefully shave his long upper lip . 
it be hard , he mutter , to meditate on man ( or woman ) than on god . 
person finish shave , wash his face clean of lather , and comb and retie his hair . 
he be proud that he had never wear a wig . 
more_and_more of the colonial were wear their own hair and not use powder . 
he feel cheerful again , refreshed ; presentable in his wide-cut brown suit , the well-made riding_boot . 
it be so easy to falsify sentiment . 
in the meadow below , militia officer shout at their men and on location two boy sit fish . 
the future would happen ; he did not have_to hurry it by think too_much . 
a man could be toss outside the dimension of time by a stray bullet these day . 
he begin to pack the saddlebag . 
and all this too shall pass_away : it come to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church_service when he be a boy - yes , in a white church with a thin spur steeple in the patriarchal location , where a feeling of plenitude be normal in those english dutch manor with their well-fed squire . 
burly leathered man and wrinkled woman in drab black rag carry_on in a primitive way , almost unchanged from feudal times . 
peasant puzzle person . 
he wonder how they could go_on in poverty , superstition , ignorance , with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their life flourish . 
person remember a bathyran meeting long_ago . 
person had return from the colony in location and , before the national leadership , exalt the miracle of dry_up swamp and irrigate the desert . 
a fund-raising_drive to buy tractor and machinery was launch . 
person remember that his own reaction had be one of indifference . 
had he find the meaning too late ? 
it aggravate him . 
the land of the location be rich , but no_one seem to care . 
in the unfertile land in location human break_one's_back their backs push willpower to the brink . 
he had sit beside person at the rostrum of a congress of zionist . 
all_of them be there in this loosely_knit association of diversified ideology , and each berate the other and beat his breast for his own approach . 
when person rise to speak , the hall become silent . 
`` i do not care if your belief take you along a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of activism . 
we be here because all our path travel a blind course through a thick forest , seek human dignity . 
beyond the forest all our path merge into a single great highway which end in the barren , eroded hills of location . 
this be our singular goal . 
how we travel through the forest be for each man 's conscience . 
where we end our journey be always the same . 
we all seek the same thing through different way - an end to this long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuse which will continue to plague us until the star_of_david fly over location '' . 
this be how person express pure zionism . 
it had sound good to person , but he did not believe it . 
in his heart he have no desire to go_to palestine . 
he loathe the idea of dry_up swamp or the chill of malaria or of leaving his natural birthright . 
before he go_into battle person had tell person , `` i only want to be a pole . 
warsaw be my city , not tel_aviv '' . 
and now person sit on a train on_the_way to location and wonder if he was not being punish for his lack of belief . 
warsaw ! 
he see the smug eye of the group chief , roman , and all the roman and the face of the peasant who hold only hatred for him . 
they had let this black_hole of death in warsaw 's heart exist without a cry of protest . 
once there had be big glittering room where person bow and kiss the lady ' hand as they flirt from behind their fan . 
warsaw ! 
warsaw ! 
`` person . 
i be a jew '' . 
day_by_day , week_by_week , month_by_month , the betrayal gnaw_at person 's heart . 
he grind his tooth together . 
i hate warsaw , he say to himself . 
i hate poland and all the goddamned mother ' son of them . 
all_of poland be a coffin . 
the terrible vision of the ghetto street flood his mind . 
what matter now ? 
what be beyond this fog ? 
only palestine , and i will never live to see palestine because i did not believe . 
by late afternoon the train inch into the marshaling yard in the railhead at location , which was fill with line of car poised to pour the tool of war to the russian front . 
at a siding , another train which be a familiar sight these day . 
deportee . 
jew . 
person 's skilled eye size_up them up . 
they be not pole . 
he guess by their appearance that they be rumanian . 
he walk toward the center of the city to keep his rendezvous with person . 
of all the place in poland , person hate location the most . 
the bathyrans were all go .

from the moment of the occupation location become a focal_point . 
he and person watch it carefully . 
location generally be the forerunner of what would happen elsewhere .

ice bath , electric_shock , lashing , wild_dog , testicle crusher . 
the group take_in ukrainian and group , and the einsatzkommandos wade knee-deep in blood and turn_into drunken , dope ridden maniac . 
location be their heart . 
in the spring of 1942 operation_reinhard begin in location . 
the ghetto , a miniature of location 's , was empty into the concentration_camp in the location suburb called location . 
as the concentration_camp empty , it was refill by a drain of the concentration_camp and town around location , then by deportee from outside poland . 
in and in and in they pour through the gate of location , but they never leave , and location was not grow any larger . 
what was happen in location ? 
be operation_reinhard the same pattern for the daily train now leave the location in warsaw ? 
was there another location in the warsaw area , as they suspect ?

we did n't have time to speak before person 's voice was screech at us from the bed . 
`` person meet person . 
exboyfriend meet ex-husband '' . 
she give the nasty laugh i ever hear . 
`` and do n't either of you forget that i'm not any man 's property . 
if you want_to fight , go down on the sidewalk '' . 
she was enjoy the situation . 
imagine that . 
person be a psychologist all_right . 
instead of wanting_to sock the poor bastard i find myself have a fellow_feeling for him . 
maybe he feel the same way . 
i never feel such a low-down hound in my life . 
first thing i know he be in the kitchenette cook_up the breakfast and i was hand person her coffee_cup and she was lie there handsome as a queen among her courtier . 
i could n't face person after that night . 
i did n't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone . 
i write her that i 'd meet_up_with person and that old bond had prove too strong and ask her to send my clothes down by express . 
of_course i had_to give her person 's address , but she never come_near us . 
all she do be write me a pleasant little note about how it be beautiful while it last but that now life had part our way and it was good-bye forever . 
she never say a word about the fifty dollar . 
she add a postscript beg me to be careful about drinking . 
i must know that that be my greatest weakness underline three time . 
afterwards i learn that person had call person on the telephone and make a big scene about person try to take_away her husband away . 
that finish me with person . 
trust person to squeeze all the drama out of a situation . 
and there i be shack_up with person in that filthy fourth floor attic on location . 
i use the phrase advisedly because there be something positively indecent about our relationship . 
i feel it and it eat_on me all_the_time , but i did n't know how right i be till later . 
what i did know be that person be always around . 
he sleep in the hall bedroom at the head of the stairs . 
`` who do you think pay the rent ? 
you would n't have me throw_out the poor boy out on the street '' , person say when i needle her about it . 
i say sure that be what i want her to do but she pay_attention no attention . 
person have a wonderful way of not listen to thing she did n't want_to hear . 
still i did n't think she was twotime me with person right then . 
to be on the safe side i never let person get_out of my sight day or night . 
person have me worried . 
i could n't make_out what his racket be . 
i 'd think him a pimp or procurer but he did n't seem to be . 
he be smooth and civil spoken but it seem to me there be something tough under his self-effacing manner . 
still he let person treat him like a valet . 
whenever the place was clean or a meal serve it was person who do the work . 
i never could find_out what his business be . 
he always seem to have money in his pocket . 
the phone had been disconnect but telegram come for him and note by special messenger . 
now_and_then he would disappear for several day . 
`` connection '' be all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when i put leading question . 
`` oh he 's just an international spy '' , person would shout with her screechy laugh . 
poor_devil he can n't have be too happy either . 
he get no relief from drink because , though sometimes person would buy himself a drink if he go out with us in the evening , he 'd leave it on the table untouched . 
when i be in liquor i ride him pretty hard i guess . 
occasionally if i push him too far he 'd give me a look out of narrowed eye and the hard cruel bony skull would show through that smooth face of his . 
`` someday '' , i tell person , `` that guy will kill us both '' . 
she just would n't listen . 
get drunk every_night be the only way i could handle the situation . 
person seem to feel the same way . 
we still have that much in_common . 
the trouble be drinking cost money . 
the way person and i were hit_it_up , we need ten or fifteen dollar an evening . 
person must have wheedle a_little out of person . 
i raise some kale by hock the good clothes i have left_over from my respectable uptown life , but when that be go i did n't have a cent . 
i do n't know what we would have do if person had n't come to town . 
person look_like a heavy person . 
he have the same bullethead of curly reddish hair but he did n't have person 's poker-faced humor or his brain or his charm . 
he be a big thick beefy violent man . 
now person may have be a lecher and a plug-ugly , but he be a good churchgoing catholic and he love his little_sister . 
those person have that irish clannishness that make them stick_together in_spite of politics and everything . 
person take_out person and me out to dinner at a swell steakhouse and tell us with tears in his eye how happy he be we had come together again . 
`` whom god hath join '' etcetera . 
the person be real religious people except for person . 
now it would be up_to me to keep the little girl out of mischief . 
person had been worry as hell ever since she 'd lose her job on that fashion magazine . 
it had go big with the location girl when he tell them his sister be an editor of art_and_apparel . 
how about me try to help her get_back her job back ? 
all evening person had be as demure as a little girl get ready for her first communion . 
it just_about blew us both out of the water when person suddenly come_out with what she come_out with . 
`` but brother i can n't take a job right now '' , she say with her eye on her ice_cream , `` i'm going_to have a baby , person 's baby , my own husband 's baby '' . 
my first thought be how had it happen so soon , but i count back on my finger and sure_enough we 'd been live together six week . 
person meanwhile was bubble_over with sentiment . 
greatest thing that ever happen . 
now person really would have_to settle_down to love honor and obey , and she 'd have_to quit drinking . 
he 'd come east for the christening , by_god he would . 
when we separate that evening person push a_hundred dollar_bill into person 's hand to help towards a layette . 
before he leave town person see_to_it that i was fix_up with a job . 
person have contact all_over the labor_movement . 
a friend of person 's named person had just muscle_into the group . 
the portwatcher be retired longshoreman and small-time seafarer off towboat and barge who act_as watchman on the wharf . 
most of them be elderly man . 
it be responsible and sometimes dangerous work because the thieving be awful in the port of location . 
they be n't as well pay as they should have been . 
one reason the portwatcher let person take_over them over be to get the protection of his muscleman . 
person need a front , some labor stiff with a clean record to act_as business_agent of the group local . 
there i be a retired group and structural ironworker who 'd never gouge a cent off a fellow_worker in my thirty years in the movement . 
for once radicalism be a recommendation . 
person could n't wait to get me hire . 
with my gray hair and my weather-beaten countenance i certainly look the honest working stiff . 
the thing a man will do for a woman . 
there be one fact which person could not overlook , one truth which he could not deny . 
as_long_as there be two human_being work together on the same project , there would be competition and you could no_more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave . 
no_matter how devoted a man be , no_matter how fully he give his life to the lord , he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that give him definition as an individual . 
all_of the job in the mission might be equal in the eye of the lord , but they be certainly not equal in the eye of the lord 's servant . 
it be only natural that person would strive for a position in which he could make the decision . 
even person himself be prey to this spirit of competition and he know it , not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church - his ambition for the bishopry had die very early in his career - but for the one clear victory he had talk_about to the colonel . 
he be not sure how much of this desire be_due to his devotion to the church and how much be his own ego , demand to be satisfy , for the two were intertwine and could not be separate . 
he want desperately to see person defeat , the communist in the village root_out , the mission stand triumphant , for in the triumph of the lord he himself would be triumphant , too . 
but perhaps this be a part of the eternal plan , that man 's ambition when link with god would be a driving_force , indefatigable force for good in the world . 
he sigh . 
how foolish it be to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith would suffice . 
he would have_to work without question the motive which make him work and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory , however it was bring_about , would be sweet indeed . 
his first move be to send person to the village to spend a_few day . 
his arm had been give him some trouble and person be not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it had heal improperly or whether person was simply rebel against the tedious work in the print_shop , use the stiffness in his arm as an excuse . 
in_any_event person send him to the local hospital to have it check , tell him to keep_his_ears_open while he be in the village to see if he could find_out what person was plan . 
person be elate at the prospect . 
he was allow to spend his night at an inn near the hospital and he was give some extra money to go_to the pachinko parlor - an excellent place to make contact with the enemy . 
he leave with all the joyous spirit of a child go on a holiday , nod attentively as person give him his final instruction . 
he was to get involved in no argument ; he was to try to make no convert ; he was simply to listen and report back what he hear . 
it be a ridiculous situation and person know it , for person , frankly partisan , openly gregarious , would make a poor espionage_agent . 
if he wanted to know anything , he would end_up ask about it point-blank , but in this guileless manner he would probably receive more truthful answer than if he try to get them by indirection . 
in all of his experience in the mission field person had never see a convert quite like person . 
from the moment that person had first walk into the mission to ask for a job , any job - his qualification neatly write on a piece_of_paper in a precise hand - he had be ready to become a christian . 
he had already been study the bible ; he know the fundamentals , and after study with person for a time he approach person , announce that he want to be baptize and that be that . 
person had never been able to find_out much about person 's past . 
person talk very little about himself except for the infrequent time when he use a personal illustration in connection with another subject . 
put the piece of this mosaic together , person have the vague outline of a biography . 
person be the fourth son of an elderly farmer who live on the coast , in location , and divide his life between the land and the sea , supplement the marginal livelihood on his small rent farm with seasonal employment on a fishing_boat . 
without exception person 's brother turn_to either one or both of their father 's occupation , but person show a talent for neither and instead spend most of his time on the beach where he repair net and prove immensely popular as a storyteller . 
he had go_into the japanese navy , had been train as an officer , had participate in one or two battle - he never go into detail regard his military experience - and at the age of twenty-five , quite as a bolt out_of_the_blue , he had walk into the mission as if he belong here and had become a christian . 
person be often curious ; often tempt to ask question but he never did . 
if and when person decide to tell him about his experience , he would do so unasked . 
person have no doubt that person would come_back from the village burst with information , ready to impart it with his customary gusto , liberally embellish with his active imagination . 
when the telephone ring on the day after person go down to the village , person have a hunch it would be person with some morsel of information too important to wait until his return , for there be few telephone in the village and the phone in person 's office rarely ring unless it be important . 
he be surprised to find person 's secretary on the other end of the line . 
he be even more startled when he hear what person want . 
the oyabun was entertain a group of dignitary , the secretary say , businessman from location for_the_most_part , and person wished to show them the mission . 
they had never see one before and had express a curiosity about it . 
`` oh '' ? 
person say . 
`` i guess it will be all_right . 
when would the oyabun like to bring his guest up_here '' ? 
`` this afternoon '' , the secretary say . 
`` at three o'clock if it will be of convenience to you at that time '' . 
`` all_right '' , person say . 
`` i will be expect them '' . 
he was about_to hang_up the phone , but a note of hesitancy in the secretary 's voice leave the conversation open . 
he have something more to say . 
`` i beg to inquire if the back be now safe for traveler '' , he say . 
person laugh despite himself . 
`` unless the oyabun has been work_on it '' , he say , then check himself and add : `` you can tell person that the back road be in very good_condition and will be quite safe for his party to use '' . 
`` arigato gosaimasu '' . 
the secretary sigh with relief and_then the telephone click in person 's hand . 
person have no idea why person want to visit the mission . 
for the oyabun to make such a trip be either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great confidence , and from all the available information it be probably the latter . 
person must feel fairly certain of his victory in_order to make a visit like this , a trip which could be so easily misinterpret by the people in the village . 
at_the_same_time , it be unlikely that any businessman would spend a day in a christian mission out_of mere curiosity . 
no , person was bring his associate here for a specific purpose and person would not be able to fathom it until they arrive . 
when he had give the call a_few moment thought , he go_into the kitchen to ask person to prepare tea and sushi for the visitor , use the formal english china and the silver tea_service which had been donate to the mission , then he go outside to inspect the grounds . 
person have a pile of cutting near one side of the lawn . 
person ask him to move it for_the_time_being ; he want the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless . 
a good initial impression would be important now . 
he go_into the print_shop , where person had just finish clean the press . 
`` how many pamphlet do we have in_stock '' ? 
person say . 
`` i should say about a_hundred_thousand '' , person say . 
`` why '' ? 
`` i would like to enact a little tableau this afternoon '' , person say , he explain about the visit and the effect he wish to create , the picture of a very busy mission . 
he did not wish to deceive person exactly , just to display the mission activity in a graphic and impressive manner . 
person nod as he listen to the instruction and say he would arrange the thing person request . 
person 's next stop be at the schoolroom , where person was monitor a test . 
he beckon to her from the door and she slip quietly outside . 
he tell her of the visitor and_then of his plan . 
`` how many child do you have present today '' ? he say . 
she look_back toward the schoolroom . 
`` fifteen '' , she say . 
`` no , only fourteen . 
the little person girl had_to go_home . 
she have a pretty bad cold '' . 
`` i would like them to appear very busy today , not busy exactly , but joyous , exuberant , full_of_life . 
i want to create the impression of a compound full of child . 
do you think you can manage it '' ? 
person smile . 
`` i 'll try '' . 
as person was walk back toward the residential hall , person come_out of the basement and bound up_to him . 
the altercation in the coffeehouse had do little to dampen his spirit , but he be still a_little wary around person for they had not_yet discuss the incident . 
`` i think i 've fix the pump so we won't have_to worry about it for a long_time '' , he say . 
`` i 've adjust the gauge so that the pump cut_out before the water get too low '' . 
`` fine '' , person say . 
he look out over the expanse of the compound . 
it was going_to take a_lot of activity to fill it . 
`` have you ever operate a transit '' ? he say . 
`` no , sir '' , person say . 
`` you are about_to become a first-class surveyor '' , person say . 
`` when person get_back with the jeep , i want you to round_up two or three japanese boy . 
person can help you . 
you 'll find an old transit in the basement . 
the glass be out_of it , but that won't matter . 
it look pretty efficient and that 's the important thing '' . 
he go_on to explain what he have_in_mind . 
person nod . 
he say he could do it . 
person was warm_to his overall strategy by the time he get_back to the residential hall . 
it be rather a childish game , all_in_all , but everybody seem to be get_into the spirit of the thing and he could not remember when he had enjoy plan anything quite so much . 
he be not sure what effect it would have , but that be really beside the point when you got right down to_it . 
he was not going_to lose the mission by default , and whatever reason person have for bring his little sightseeing group to the mission , he was going_to be in_for a surprise . 
he find person in the parlor and ask her to make sure everything be in_order in the residential hall , and_then to take_charge of the office while the party be here . 
when everything had been do , person go_back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly report until three o'clock . 
at two thirty he send person to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to keep_an_eye_on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpse the approach of person 's party . 
then person , attired in his best blue serge suit , sit in a chair out on the lawn , in the shade of a tree , smoke a cigarette and wait . 
the air be cool here , and the lacy pattern of the tree throw a dappled shadow on the grass , an effect which he find pleasant . 
she conclude by ask him to name another hour should this one be inconvenient . 
the fish take the bait . 
he reply that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meet with a stranger , but - joy of joy , he would be at home at the hour mention . 
but when she call he had think better of the matter and decide not to involve himself in a new entanglement . 
she was tell by the manservant who open the door that his lordship was engage on work from which he had leave strict order he was not to be disturb . 
person be bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff daunt her purpose . 
she write again and now , abandon for_the_moment the theme of love , she ask for help in the matter of her career . 
she could act and she could write . 
his lordship was concerned in the management of drury_lane but , if there be no opportunity there , would he read and criticize her novel ? 
at_last he consent to meet her , and following that brief interview person write him a yet more remarkable proposal : 
have you any objection to the following plan ? 
on thursday evening we may go_out of town together by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve mile . 
there we shall be free and unknown ; we can return the following morning . 
she conclude by ask for a brief interview - `` to settle with you where '' - and she throw_in a tribute to his `` gentle manners '' and `` the wild originality of your countenance '' . 
she open his reply with trembling finger . 
he agree ! 
and he would see her that evening . 
victory at_last ! 
at their meeting he tell her not to bother about `` where '' - he would attend to that . 
there be one of the new forte-piano in the room and , as person rise to go , he ask her to sing him one song before she leave . 
she sing him person 's charming ballad `` rosabelle '' , which be the vogue of the moment . 
she had never sing better . 
`` your voice be delightful '' , he approve with a warm smile . 
`` tomorrow will be a new experience - i have never before make_love to a nightingale . 
there have be cooing dove , chattering magpie , thieving jackdaw , a proud peacock , a silly goose , and a harpy_eagle - whom i be silly enough to mate with and who be now busy tear at my vitals '' . 
and so they go , he choose of all place an inn near medmenham_abbey , scene a generation ago of the obscene orgy of the hellfire_club . 
he regale person with an account of the mock mass perform by the cassocked blood , which he had have at firsthand from old person , one of the leader of the so-called `` order '' . 
each wear the monkish scourge at his waist but this , it seem , was not employ for self-flagellation . 
naked girl dance in the chancel of the abbey , the young and seemingly the most innocent being choose to read a sermon filled with veiled depravity . 
the jaded amorist conjure_up picture of the blasphemous rite with relish . 
alas , all that belong_to the age of `` devil_dashwood '' and `` wicked_wilkes '' , abbot and beadsman of the order ! 
the casual seduction of a seventeen year old bluestocking seem tame by comparison . 
they pass close by the turn to bishopsgate . 
a scant half_mile away person and person were doubtless sit on their diminutive terrace , the air about them scented with stock , and listen to the nightingale who had nest in the big lime_tree at the foot of the garden . 
charming and peaceful - but what be charm and peace compare to high adventure ? 
alone with the fabulous person ! 
how many woman had long for the privilege that be hers . 
how was she to behave , person wonder . 
to be passive , to be girlishly shy be palpably absurd . 
she be the pursuer as clearly as be person in shakespeare 's poem . 
and while her adonis did not suffer from inexperience , satiety might well be an equal handicap . 
no , she would not pretend modesty , but neither must she be crudely bold . 
mystery - that be the thing . 
in the bedroom she would insist on darkness . 
with his clubfoot he might well be grateful . 
at the inn , which be situated close to a broad weir , person was greet by the landlord with obsequious deference and address as `` milord '' . 
the place be evidently a familiar haunt and person wonder what other illicit love had been celebrate in the comfortable rooms to which they were show . 
the fire in the sitting_room be lighted . 
`` what about the bedroom '' ? 
person inquire . 
`` seem to me last time i be here the grate bellowed out smoke as it might have been prepare us for hell '' . 
`` we find some owl had build a nest in the chimney , milord , but i promise you you 'll never have trouble of that sort again '' . 
so , not_only had he be here before , but it seem he might well come again . 
person feel suddenly small and cheap , heroine of a trivial episode in the voluminous history of person . 
a cold supper was order and a bottle of port . 
when person 's ship had bear him to location , french wine had start to cross the location , the first shipment in a dozen war-ridden year , but the supplies had not_yet reach rural hostelry where the sweet wine of the spanish peninsula still rule . 
as they wait for supper they sit by the fire , glass in_hand , while person philosophize as much for his own entertainment as hers . 
`` sex be overpriced '' , he say . 
`` the great greek tragedy are concern with man against fate , not man against man for the prize of a woman 's body . 
so do n't see yourself as a heroine or fancy this little adventure be an event of major importance '' . 
`` the god seem to think sex pretty important '' , she rebut . 
`` mars and venus , bacchus and ariadne , jupiter and io , person and the nymph of the owl 's nest . 
that would be minerva , i suppose . 
be n't the owl her symbol '' ? 
person laugh . 
`` so you know something of the classics , do you '' ? 
`` tell me about minerva , how she behave , what she do to please you '' . 
`` i 'll tell you nothing . 
i do n't ask you who ' tis you 're be unfaithful to , husband or lover . 
frankly , i do n't care '' . 
for a moment she think_of answer with the truth but she know there be man who shy_away_from virginity , who demand some degree of education in body as_well_as mind . 
`` very_well '' , she say , `` i 'll not catechize you . 
what matter the others so_long_as i have my place in history '' . 
she was striking_the_right_note . 
no man ever have a better opinion of himself and indeed , with one so favor , flattery could hardly seem overdone . 
brain and beauty , high position in both the social and intellectual world , athlete , fabled lover - if ever the_world_was_any_man's_oyster it be his . 
the light supper over , person go to him and , slip an arm about his shoulder , sit on his knee . 
he draw her close and , hand on cheek , turn her face to his . 
her lip , moist and parted , speak his name . 
`` person '' ! 
his hand go to her shoulder and push_aside the knotted scarf that surmount the striped poplin gown ; then , to better purpose , he take_hold_of the knot and with dextrous finger , untie it . 
the bodice beneath be buttoned and , withdraw his lip from hers , he set her upright on his knee and start to undo it , unhurriedly as if she be a child . 
but , kindled by his kiss , his caressing hand , her desire be aflame . 
she spring up and go swiftly to the bedroom . 
person pour himself another glass of wine and hold it up to the candle_flame admire the rich color . 
he drink slowly with due appreciation . 
it be an excellent vintage . 
he rise and go to the bedroom . 
pause in the doorway he say : `` the form of the human female , unlike her mind and her spirit , be the most challenging loveliness in all nature '' . 
when person return to bishopsgate she long to tell them she had become person 's mistress . 
by odd coincidence , on the evening of her return person choose to read parisina , which be the latest of the titled poet 's success . 
as he declaim the sonorous measure , it was as_much_as person could do to restrain herself from burst_out with her dramatic tidings . 
`` although it be not the best of which he be capable '' , say person as he close the book , `` it be still poetry of a high order '' . 
`` if he would only leave the location '' , say person . 
`` i be tired_of sultan and scimitar '' . 
`` the hero of his next poem be person '' , say person , with slightly overdone carelessness . 
`` how do you know that '' ? demand person . 
`` i was tell it on_good_authority '' , person answer darkly . 
`` i must n't tell , i must n't tell '' , she repeat to herself . 
`` i promise him i would n't '' . 
winter come , and with it person 's baby - a boy as she had wish . 
person , he be called , in honor of the man who be at_once person 's pensioner and his most bitter detractor . 
with a pardonable irony person write to the father who had publicly disown his daughter : 
`` person and person will probably be glad to hear that person has safely recover from a very favorable confinement , and that her child be well '' . 
at_the_same_time another child - this one of person 's brain - was give to the world : alastor , a poem of pervading beauty in which the reader may gaze into the still depth of a fine mind 's musing . 
alastor was publish only to be savagely attack , contemptuously ignore . 
person send a copy to person , a former friend , and another to person . 
neither acknowledge the gift . 
only person 's praise sustain him in his disappointment . 
she understand completely . 
not a thought nor a cadence was miss in her summary of appreciation . 
`` you have make the labor worthwhile '' , he say to her , smiling . 
`` and in the future , since i write for a public of one , i can save the poor publisher from waste their money '' . 
`` a public of one '' , person echo reprovingly . 
`` how can you say such a thing ? 
there will be thousand who will thrill to the loveliness of alastor . 
there be some even now . 
what about that dear , clever person ? 
i be sure he be in rapture '' . 
`` poor person , he always has to be trot_out for my encouragement '' . 
`` there be other person . 
not everyone be bewitched by person 's caliph and harem beauty '' . 
person 's super critical attitude toward person had nothing to_do_with his moral disrepute . 
she be resentful of his easy success as compare with person 's failure . 
the same month that alastor was publish , murray sell twenty thousand copy of the_siege_of_corinth , a slovenly bit of byronism that even person 's generosity rebel at . 
the lordly poet be at low-water_mark . 
the careless writing be in keeping with his mood of savage discontent . 
on all side door were being slam in his face . 
the previous scandal , gaily divert as they be , had only serve to increase his popularity . 
now , under the impact of his wife 's disclosure , he was bring suddenly to the realization that there be a limit to tolerance , however brilliant , however far-famed the offender might be . 
he try defiance and openly flaunt his devotion to his half_sister , but he soon see , as did she , that this course if persist_in would involve them in a common ruin . 
for_the_moment there be no woman in his life , and it was this vacuum that had give person her opportunity . 
but the liaison successfully start in the last day of autumn was now languish . 
person , since the separation from his wife had been live in a smallish house in piccadilly_terrace . 
he refuse to bring person to it even as an occasional visitor , claim that his every move was watch by spy of the milbankes . 
person hand the pass to the colonel . 
he had think that the suggestion of take it himself would tip the colonel in the direction of serve his own order , but the slip_of_paper was fold and absently thrust into the colonel 's belt . 
despite his yearning , the colonel would not go_down to see the men come_through the line . 
he would remain in the tent , wait impatiently , occupy by some trivial task . 
- person . 
- sir ? 
- fetch me the copy of everything b and c company have requisition in the last six month . 
- the last six month , sir ? 
- you hear me . 
there 's a_lot of waste go_on here . 
it 's got_to stop . 
i want to take_a_look . 
this be no damn holiday , person . 
get busy . 
- yes , sir . 
person leave the tent . 
below he could see the bright torch light the riverbank . 
he glance back . 
the colonel crouch tensely on one of the folding_chair , methodically tear at his thumbnail . 
the bombproof be a low-ceilinged structure of heavy timber covered with earth . 
it stand some fifty pace from the edge of the bank . 
from the outside , it seem no more than a low drumlin , a lump on the dark earth . 
a crude ladder run down to a wooden floor . 
two slit enable observer to watch across the river . 
the place smell strongly of rank , fertile earth , rotting wood and urine . 
the plank floor was slime beneath person 's boot . 
at_least the union officer had been decent enough to provide a candle . 
there be no place to sit , but person walk slowly from the ladder to the window slit and back , stoop slightly to avoid strike his head on the heavy beam . 
in the corner be the soldier with the white_flag . 
he stand stiffly erect , clutch the staff , his body half hidden by the limp cloth . 
person hardly look at him . 
the man had come flounder aboard the flat-bottomed barge at the last instant , brandish the flag_of_truce . 
someone had haul him over the side , and he had remain silent while they cross . 
an officer with a squad of man had been wait on the bank . 
the man in the boat had start yell happily at first sight of the officer , two of them call him person . 
when the boat had touch , the weak ones and the two wounded man had been lift out and carry_away by the soldier . 
person had present his pouch and been lead to the bombproof . 
the officer had tell him that both list must be check . 
person had give his name and ask for a safe-conduct pass . 
the officer , surprised , say he would have to see . 
person had nod absently and mutter that he would check the list himself later . 
he had peer through the darkness at the rampart . 
the man he would take_back across the river stand there , but he turn_away from them . 
he want no part of the emotion of the exchange , no memory of the joy and gratitude that other man feel . 
he had hope to be alone in the bombproof , but the soldier had follow him . 
though person carefully ignore the man , he could not deny his presence . 
perhaps it would be better to speak_to him , since silence could not exorcise his form . 
person glance briefly at him , see only a body rigidly erect behind the languid banner . 
- we won't be too long . 
if my pass is approve , i may be a half-hour . 
the soldier answer in a curious , muffled voice , his lip barely move . 
person turn_away and did not see the man 's knee buckle and his body sag . 
- yes , sir . 
he had acknowledge the man . 
it was easy to think now , person decide . 
the stiff figure in the corner no_longer block his thought . 
he pace slowly , stoop , stare at the damp , slippery floor . 
he try to order the word of the three union officer , seek to create some coherent portrait of the dead boy . 
but he grope blindly . 
his lack of success steadily erode his interest . 
he stop pace , lean_against the dank , timbered wall and let his mind drift . 
a feeling of futility , an enervation of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever know , seep through him . 
what in_the_name_of_god was he do , crouch in a timbered pit on the wrong bank of the river ? 
why had he cross the dark water , to bring_back a group of reclaimed soldier or to skulk in a foul-smelling hole ? 
he grow annoyed and at_the_same_time surprised at that emotion . 
he be conscious of a growing sense of absurdity . 
person had write_out it all out , had n't he ? 
was n't the report official enough ? 
what did he hope to accomplish here ? 
person had order him not to leave the far bank . 
prompt by a guilty urge , he had disobey the order of a man he respect . 
for what ? 
to tell person something he would find_out for himself . 
the figure in the corner belch loudly , a deep , liquid eruption . 
person snort and_then laugh aloud . 
exactly ! 
the soldier 's voice be muffled again , stricken with chagrin . 
he clutch the staff , and his dark eye blink apologetically . 
- ' excuse me , sir . 
- let 's get_out of here . 
person run up the ladder and stand for a second suck_in the cool air that smell of mud and river weed . 
to his left , the two skiff dent their sharp bow into the soft bank . 
the flat-bottomed boat swing slowly to the pull of the current . 
a soldier hold the end of a frayed rope . 
three union guard appear , carry their rifle at ready . 
person stare at them curiously . 
they be stocky men , well-fed and clean-shaven , with neat uniform and sturdy boot . 
behind them shamble a long column of weak , tattered men . 
the thin gray figure raise a hoarse , caw cry like the call of a bird flock . 
they move toward the skiff with shocking eagerness , elbow and shove . 
four men were knock_down , but did not attempt to rise . 
they creep down the muddy slope toward the wait boat . 
the union soldier ground arms and settle into healthy , indifferent posture to watch the feeble boarding of the skiff . 
the crawl men try to rise and fall again . 
no_one move to them . 
person watch two of them flounder into the shallow water and listen to their voice beg shrilly . 
in a confused , soaked and stumbling shift of body and lift arm , the two man were drag into the same skiff . 
the third crawl man force himself erect . 
he sway like a drunkard , his arm mill in slow circle . 
he pace forward unsteadily , lean too far back , his head tilt oddly . 
his step be short and stiff , and , with his head throw_back , his progress be a supercilious strut . 
he appear to be peer haughtily down_his_nose at the crowded and unclean vessel that would carry him to freedom . 
he stalk into the water and fall heavily over the side of the flat-bottomed barge , his weight nearly swamp the craft . 
person look_for the fourth man . 
he had reach the three passive guard ; he creep in an incertain manner , pat the ground before him . 
the guard did not look at him . 
the figure on the earth halt , seemingly bewildered . 
he sink back on his thin haunch like a weary hound . 
then he begin to crawl again . 
person watch the creep figure . 
he feel a spectator interest . 
would the man make_it or not ? 
if only there be a clock for him to crawl against . 
if he fail to reach the riverbank in five minute , say , then the skiff would pull away and leave him grope in the mud . 
say three minute to make it sporting . 
still the guard did not move , but stand inert , aloof from the slow scramble man . 
the figure halt , and person gasp . 
the man begin to creep in the wrong direction , deceive by a slight rise in the ground ! 
he turn slowly and begin to crawl back up the bank toward the rampart . 
person race for him , his boot slam the soft earth . 
the guard came_to_life with astonishing menace . 
they spin and fling their rifle up . 
person gesticulate wildly . 
one man drop to his knee for better aim . 
- let me help him , for_the_love_of_god ! 
the guard lower their rifle and their rifle and peer at person with sullen , puzzled face . 
person pound to the crawl man and stop , pant heavily . 
he reach down and close his finger on the man 's upper arm . 
beneath his clutch , a flat strip of muscle surge on the bone . 
person bend awkwardly and lift the man to his foot . 
person stare into a cadaverous face . 
two clotted ball the color of mucus roll between fiery lid . 
light stick of finger , the tip gummy with dark earth , pat at person 's throat . 
the man 's voice be a sweet , patient whisper . 
- person say that he 'd take my arm and get me right there . 
but you ai_n't person . 
- no . 
- it do n't matter . 
be it far ? 
how far could it be , person think bleakly , how far can a blind_man crawl ? 
another body_length or all the rest of his nighted life ? 
- not far . 
- you talk deep . 
not like us fella . 
it raise the voice , bein in camp . 
you secesh ? 
- yes . 
come_on , now . 
can you walk ? 
- why , course i can . 
i can walk real good . 
person stumble down the bank . 
the man lean his frail body against person 's shoulder . 
he be no heavy than a child . 
person pause for breath . 
the man wheeze weakly , his fetid breath beat softly against person 's neck . 
his sweet whisper come after great effort . 
- oh , christ . 
i wish you be person . 
he promise to take me . 
- hush . 
we 're almost there . 
person support the man to the edge of the bank and pass the frail figure over the bow of the near skiff . 
the man sway on a thwart , turn his ruined eye from side to side . 
person turn_away , sicken for_the_first_time in many month . 
he hear the patient voice call . 
- person ? 
where be you , person ? 
- make him lie_down ! 
person snatch a deep breath . 
he had not mean to shout . 
he stand with his back to the skiff . 
the man mew and scratch , beg to be take_away . 
person speak bewilderedly to the dark night flecked with pine_knot torch . 
- goddamn you ! 
what do you do to them ? 
intelligence jab at him accusingly . 
he be angry , sicken . 
he had not feel that during the afternoon . 
no , nor later . 
all his emotion had be inward , self-conscious . 
in war , on a night like this , it was only the outward emotion that matter , what could be fling out into the darkness to damage others . 
yes . 
that be it . 
he be sure of_it . 
person 's type of man allow this sort of thing to happen . 
what a fool he had be to think_of his brother ! 
so person be dead . 
what did it matter ? 
his name had been cross_off a list . 
already his cool body lay in the ground . 
what word have any meaning ? 
what had he think_of , to go to person , grovel and beg understanding ? 
to confess with a canvas chair as a prie-dieu , gouge at his heart until a rough and stupid hand bid him rise and go ? 
man were slaughter every_day , tumble into eternity like so many torn parcel fling down a portable chute . 
what make him think person have a right to witness his brother 's humiliation ? 
what right have person to any special consideration ? 
was person better , more deserving ? 
to_hell_with person . 
let him chafe with_impatience to see person , rip open the note with trembling hand and read the formal report in person 's beautiful , schoolmaster 's hand . 
person would curse . 
he believe that brave boy did n't cry . 
person spit on the ground . 
he be grimly satisfy . 
he had stupidly think himself compel to ease his brother 's pain . 
now he know perfectly that he had but long to increase his own suffering . 
i would not want to be one of those writer who begin each morning by exclaim , `` o person , o person , o person and person , what would you have made_of a bomb_shelter ornament with four plaster_of_paris duck , a birdbath , and three composition gnome with long beard and red mobcap '' ? 
as i say , i would n't want to begin a day like this , but i often wonder what the dead would have do . 
but the shelter be as_much a part of my landscape as the beech and horse_chestnut tree that grow on the ridge . 
i can see it from this window where i write . 
it was build by the person , and stand on the acre of ground that adjoin our property . 
it bulk under a veil of thin , new grass , like some embarrassing fact of physicalness , and i think person set_out the statuary to soften its meaning . 
it would have be like her . 
she be a pale woman . 
sit on her terrace , sit in her parlor , sit anywhere , she ground_an_axe of self-esteem . 
offer her a cup of tea and she would say , `` why , these cup look_like just like a set i give to the group last year '' . 
show her the new swimming_pool and she would say , slap her ankle , `` i suppose this must be where you breed your gigantic mosquito '' . 
hand her a chair and she would say , `` why , it 's a nice imitation of those queen_anne chair i inherit from person '' . 
these trumps be more touching than they be anything else , and seem to imply that the night be long , her child ungrateful , and her marriage bewilderingly threadbare . 
twenty year ago , she would have been known as a golf_widow , and the sum of her manner be perhaps one of bereavement . 
she usually wear weeds , and a stranger watch her board a train might have guess that person be dead , but person be far from dead . 
he was march up_and_down the locker_room of the group shout , `` bomb cuba ! 
bomb berlin ! 
let 's throw a_little nuclear hardware at them and show them who 's boss '' . 
he be brigadier of the club 's locker_room light infantry , and at one time or another declare war on russia , czechoslovakia , yugoslavia , and china . 
it all begin on an autumn afternoon - and who , after all these century , can describe the fineness of an autumn day ? 
one might pretend never to have see one before , or , to more purpose , that there would never be another like it . 
the clear and searching sweep of sun on the lawn be like a climax of the year 's light . 
leaf were burn somewhere and the smoke smell , for all its ammoniac acidity , of beginning . 
the boundless blue_air was stretch over the zenith like the skin of a drum . 
leave her house one late afternoon , person stop to admire the october light . 
it be the day to canvass for infectious_hepatitis . 
person had been give sixteen name , a bundle of literature , and a printed book of receipt . 
it was her work to go among her neighbor and collect their check . 
her house stand on a rise of ground , and before she get_into her car she look at the house below . 
charity as she know it be complex and reciprocal , and almost every roof she see signify charity . 
person work for the brain . 
person did mental_health . 
person work for the blind . 
person be in_charge_of disease of the nose and throat . 
person was tuberculosis , person was mother ' march_of_dimes , person was cancer , and person do the kidney . 
person lead the birthcontrol league , person was arthritis , and way in the distance could be see the slate_roof of person 's house , a roof that signify gout . 
person undertake the work of go from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer . 
it be her destiny ; it be her life . 
her mother had done it before her , and even her old grandmother , who had collect money for smallpox and unwed mother . 
person had telephone most of her neighbor in_advance , and most of them be ready for her . 
she experience none of the suspense of some poor stranger sell encyclopedia . 
here_and_there she stay to visit and drink a glass of sherry . 
the contribution be ahead_of what she had get the previous year , and while the money , of_course , be not hers , it excite her to stuff her kit with big check . 
she stop at the person ' after dusk , and have a scotch_and_soda . 
she stay too late , and when she leave , it be dark and time to go_home and cook supper for her husband . 
`` i get a_hundred and sixty dollar for the hepatitis fund '' , she say excitedly when he walk in . 
`` i do everybody on my list but the person and the person . 
i want to get_in my kit in tomorrow morning - would you mind do them while i cook the dinner '' ? 
`` but i do n't know the person '' , person say . 
`` nobody does , but they give me ten last year '' . 
he be tired , he have his business worry , and the sight of his wife arrange porkchop in the broiler only seem like an extension of a boring day . 
he be happy enough to take the convertible and race up the hill to the person ' , think that they might give him a drink . 
but the person be away ; their maid give him an envelope with a check in it and shut the door . 
turn_in at the person ' driveway , he try to remember if he had ever meet them . 
the name encourage him , because he always feel that he could handle the_irish . 
there be a glass pane in the front_door , and through this he could see into a hallway where a plump woman with red hair was arrange flower . 
`` infectious_hepatitis '' , he shout heartily . 
she take_a_look a good look at herself in the mirror before she turn and , walk with very small step , start toward the door . 
`` oh , please come_in '' , she say . 
the girlish voice be nearly a whisper . 
she be not a girl , he could see . 
her hair was dye , and her bloom was fade , and she must have been crowd forty , but she seem to be one of those woman who cling_to the manners and grace of a pretty child of eight . 
`` your wife just call '' , she say , separate one word from another , exactly like a child . 
`` and i be not sure that i have any cash - any money , that_is - but if you will wait just a minute i will write you out a check if i can find my checkbook . 
wo n't you step into the living_room , where it be cozy '' ? 
a fire had just been light , he see , and thing had been set_out for drink , and , like any stray , his response to these comforts be instantaneous . 
where be person , he wonder . 
travel home on a late train ? 
change his clothes upstairs ? 
take a shower ? 
at the end of the room there be a desk heap with papers , and she begin to riffle these , make sigh and and noise of girlish exasperation . 
`` i be terribly sorry to keep_waiting you wait '' , she say , `` but won't you make yourself a little drink while you wait ? 
everything 's on the table '' . 
`` what train does person come_out on '' ? 
`` person be away '' , she say . 
her voice drop . 
`` person has be away for six week '' . 
`` i 'll have a drink , then , if you 'll have one with me '' . 
`` if you will promise to make it weak '' . 
`` sit_down '' , he say , `` and enjoy your drink and look_for your checkbook later . 
the only way to find thing be to relax '' . 
all_in_all , they have six drink . 
she describe herself and her circumstances unhesitatingly . 
person manufacture plastic tongue_depressor . 
he travel all_over the world . 
she did n't like to travel . 
plane make her feel faint , and in tokyo , where she had go that summer , she had been give raw fish for breakfast and so she had come straight home . 
she and her husband had formerly live in new_york , where she have many friend , but person think the country would be safe in_case_of war . 
she would rather live in danger than die of loneliness and boredom . 
she have no child ; she had make no friend . 
`` i 've see you , though , before '' , she say with enormous coyness , pat his knee . 
`` i 've see you walk your dog on sunday and drive by in the convertible '' . 
the thought of this lonely woman sit at her window touch him , although he was even more touch by her plumpness . 
sheer plumpness , he know , be not a vital part of the body and have no procreative function . 
it serve merely as an excess cushion for the rest of the carcass . 
and know its humble place in the scale of thing , why did he , at this time_of_life , seem almost ready to sell his soul for plumpness ? 
the remark she make about the suffering of a lonely woman seem so broad at_first that he did n't know what to make_of them , but after the sixth drink he put his arm around her and suggest that they go upstairs and look_for her checkbook there . 
`` i 've never do this before '' , she say later , when he was arrange himself to leave . 
her voice shake with feeling , and he think it lovely . 
he did n't doubt her truthfulness , although he had hear the words a_hundred_times . 
`` i 've never do this before '' , they always say , shake their dress down over their white shoulder . 
`` i 've never do this before '' , they always say , wait for the elevator in the hotel corridor . 
`` i 've never do this before '' , they always say , pour another whiskey . 
`` i 've never do this before '' , they always say , put_on their stocking . 
on ship at_sea , on railroad_train , in summer hotel with mountain view , they always say , `` i 've never do this before '' . 
`` where have you be '' ? 
person ask sadly , when he come_in . 
`` it 's after eleven '' . 
`` i have a drink with the person '' . 
`` she tell me he be in germany '' . 
`` he come home unexpectedly '' . 
person eat some supper in the kitchen and go_into the tv_room to hear the news . 
`` bomb them '' ! he shout . 
`` throw a_little nuclear hardware at them ! 
show them who be boss '' ! 
but in bed he have trouble sleep . 
he think_of first of his son and daughter , away at college . 
he love them . 
it be the only meaning of the word that he had ever know . 
then he play nine imaginary hole of golf , choose his handicap , his iron , his stance , his opponent , and his weather in_detail , but the green of the links seem fade in the light of his business worry . 
his money was tie_up in a nassau hotel , an ohio pottery works , and a detergent for window-washing , and luck had been run against him . 
his worry harry him up out of bed , and he light a cigarette and go to the window . 
in the starlight he could see the tree strip of their leaf . 
during the summer he had try to repair some of his losses at the track , and the bare tree remind him that his parimutuel ticket would still be lie , like leaf , in the gutter near location and location . 
maple and ash , beech and elm , one_hundred to win on three in the fourth , fifty to win on six in the third , one_hundred to win on two in the eighth . 
child walk home from school would scuff through what seem to be his foliage . 
then , get_back into bed , he think_of unashamedly of person , plan where they would next meet and what they would do . 
there be , he think , so few true means of forgetfulness in this life that why should he shun the medicine even when the medicine seem , as it did , a_little crude ? 
it was not as_though she note clearly that her nephew had not been to see her for ten year , not since their last journey eastward to witness their person being lower into the rocky soil ; that aside from due notification of certain major event in their life ( two marriage , two birth , one divorce ) , christmas_card and easter_card of the traditional sort had be the only thin link she have with them through the widowed year . 
her thought be not discrete . 
but there be a look about her mouth as_though she were taste lemon . 
she grasp the chair arm and bring her thin body upright , like a bird alert for flight . 
she turn and walk stiffly into the parlor to the dainty legged escritoire , warp and cracked now from fifty year in an atmosphere of sea_spray . 
there she extract two limp vellum sheet and write_off the letter , one to person , one to person . 
once her trembling hand , with the pen grasp tight in it , was press against the paper the word come sharply , smoothly , as authoritatively as they would drop from her own lip . 
and the stiffly regal look of them , she see grimly , lack the quaver of age which , thwart the effort of her amazing will , run through her spoken_word like a thin ragged string . 
`` please come_down as_soon_as you conveniently can '' , the upright letter stalked from the broad nibbed pen , `` i have an important matter to discuss with you '' . 
to person : 
`` i be afraid there be not much to amuse small child here . 
i should be oblige if you could make other arrangement for your daughter . 
you may stay as long as you wish , of_course , but if arrange for the care of the girl must take_into_account time into_account , i think a day or two should be enough to finish our business in '' . 
to person : `` please give my regard to person '' . 
she sign the letter quickly , stamp them , and place them on the hall table for person to mail in town . 
then she go_back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjust her eye to the glare on the water . 
`` my nephew will be come_down '' , she say that evening as person bring her dinner into the dining_room , the whole meal on a vast linen covered tray . 
she look at the girl speculatively from eye which had pale with the years ; from the early evening light of them which had first startle person to look at her in an uncousinly way , they had fade to a near absence of color which have , possibly from her constant looking_at the water , something of the light of the sea in them . 
person place the tray on the table and with a flick of dark wrist draw_off the cloth . 
she smile , and the tooth gleam in her beautifully modeled olive face . 
`` that will be so nice for you , person '' , she say . 
her voice be ripe and full and her tooth flash again in sicilian brilliance before the warm curved lip meet and her mouth settle in repose . 
`` um '' , say the old lady , and bring her eye down to the tray . 
`` you remember them , i suppose '' ? 
she glint suspiciously at the dish before her : `` blowfish . 
i hope person buy them whole '' . 
person step back , her eye roam the tray for omission . 
then she look at the old_woman again , her eye calm . 
`` yes '' , she say , `` i remember that they come here every summer . 
i used_to play with the older one sometimes , when he 'd let me . 
person '' ? 
the name fell with lazy affectionate remembrance from her lip . 
for an instant the old aunt feel something indefinable flash through her smile . 
she would have say triumph . 
then person turn and with an easy grace walk toward the kitchen . 
person lift her head and follow the retreating figure , her eye rest nearly close on the unselfconscious rise and fall of the rounded hip . 
for a moment she hold her face to the empty doorway ; then she snort and grope_for her fork . 
there 's no great catastrophe in the universe , she reflect dourly , impale tender green_bean on the silver fork , than the dwindling_away of a family . 
procreation , expansion , proliferation - these be the law of living_thing , with the penalty for not obey them the ultimate in punishment : oblivion . 
when the fate of the individual is visit on the group , then ( the warm sweet butter drip from her raised trembling fork and she push her head forward belligerently ) , ah , then the true bitterness of existence could be taste . 
and indeed the young garden bean be brackish in her mouth . 
she be the last living of the older generation . 
what had once be a widespread family - at one time , she know , there be enough person to populate an entire county - had now narrow_down to the two boy , person and person . 
she swing her eye up to the blue of the window , her jaw gently mash the bitter bean . 
what hope lie_in the nephew , she ask the intensifying light out there , with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced , having sire two girl child , with none to bear_on the person name ? 
she eat . 
it seem to her , as it seem each night , that the gloom draw_in itself in and become dense at the table 's empty chair , give her the frequent illusion that she dine with shadow . 
here , too , she talk low , quirk her head at one or another of the place , most often at person 's armchair which face her across the long table . 
or it might have been the absent nephew she address , consciously play with the notion that this be one of the summer of their early years . 
she think_of again of her child , those two who had die young , before the later science which might have save them could attach even a label to their separate malignancy . 
the girl , her first , she barely remember . 
it could have be anyone 's infant , for it had not survive the bassinet . 
but the boy , the boy had be alive yesterday . 
each successive movement in his growing was record on the unreeling film inside her . 
he run on his plump sticks of leg , freeze now_and_again into the sudden startled attitude which the camera had catch and hold_on the paling photograph , all carefully place and glue and label , rest in the fat plush album in the bottom drawer of the escritoire . 
in the cruel clearness of her memory the boy remain unchanged , quick with the delight of laughter , and the pain with which she recall that short destroyed childhood be still unendurable to her . 
it be one with the desolate rock and the alien water on those day when she hate the sea . 
the brother drive down together in person 's small red sports_car , person at_the_wheel . 
they rarely speak . 
person sit and regard the farm country which , spread_out from both side of the road , roll greenly up to where the silent white house and long barn and silo nest into the tilled field . 
he see the land with a stranger 's eye , all the old familiarness go . 
and it present itself to him as it would to any stranger , impervious , complete in itself . 
there be stability there , too - a color which his life had have once . 
that is what childhood be , he tell himself . 
solid , settle , lose . 
in the stiff neutral line of the telephone_pole he see the no-nonsense pen stroke of person 's letter . 
what bad grace , what incredible selfishness he and person had show . 
the boyhood summer preceding their uncle 's funeral might never have be . 
they had close over , absolutely , with the sealing of old person 's grave . 
the small car fly_on relentlessly . 
the old_woman , stubbornly reign in the house above the crash water take_on an ominous reality . 
person move and adjust his long leg . 
`` i suppose it has to do with the property '' , person had say over the telephone when they had discuss their receipt of the letter . 
not until the word had been speak did person suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea , and feel his contrition blot_out in one shameful moment of covetousness . 
he and person be the last of the family , and there lie the location property which had seem to have no_end , stretch from horizon to horizon , in those golden day of summer . 
now person turn his head to look at his brother . 
person hold the wheel loosely , but his finger curve around it in a purposeful way and the deliberate set of his body speak plainly of the figure he 'd make in the years to come . 
his sandy hair was already begin to thin and recede at the side , and person look_away quickly away . 
person easily look years old than himself , settled , his world comfortably categorized . 
the vacation traffic was become heavy as they approach the sea . 
`` she did n't mention bring person '' , person say , maneuver the car into the next lane . 
`` she 's probably get old - crotchety , i mean - and we figure uh-uh , better not . 
they 've never meet , you_know . 
but person would n't budge without an express invitation . 
i feel kind_of bad about it '' . 
he give person a quick glance and move close to the wheel , hug it to him , and person catch this brief of allusion to guilt . 
`` i imagine the old girl have n't miss us much '' , location add , his eye on the road . 
person ignore the half expressed bid for confirmation . 
he smile . 
it be barely possible that his brother be right . 
he could tell they were approach the sea . 
the air take_on a special strength now that they 'd leave_behind the fecund warmth of the farmland behind . 
there be the smell of the coast , like a primeval memory , compose of equal part saltwater , clam , seaweed and northern air . 
he turn from the fly_by tree to look ahead and see with an inward boy 's eye again the great fieldstone house which , build on one of the many acre of ancestral land bordering the west harbor , had be person 's bride-gift to his cousin wife as the last century end . 
person 's thought must have been keep silent pace beside his own , climb the same crag in dirty white sneaker , clamber out on top of the headland and come_upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant . 
`` remember the starbird ? '' 
person ask , and person lift his eye from the double line in the middle of the road , the twin white ribbon which the car swallow rapidly as it ascend the crest of the hill and come_down . 
`` the_starbird , '' person say . 
there be the day person had , in an unexpected grandiose gesture , hand_over the pretty sloop to person for_keeps , on_condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever the younger boy wish . 
the two of them had develop into a remarkable sailing team . 
all_of this happen in a time of their life when their youth and their brotherhood knit them together as no other time or circumstance could . 
they seem then to have have a single mind and body , a mutuality which had been accept with the fact of their youth , casually . 
he see the starbird as she lie , her slender mast up and gently turn , its point describe constant languid circle against a cumulus sky . 
both of them had know the feeling of the small life in her wait , ready , for the two of them to run_up her sail . 
the starbird had be long at the bottom of the bay . 
they come unexpectedly upon the sea . 
meet it without preparation as they did , rob of anticipation , a common disappointment seize them . 
they were climb the hill in the night when the headlight abruptly probe solid blackness , become two parallel luminous tube which broaden out into a faint mist of light and end . 
person stop the car and switch_off the light and they sit looking_at the water , which , there be no moon out , at_first could be distinguish from the sky only by an absence of star . 
his eye be old and they never see well , but heat with whisky they 'd glare at my noise , grow red and raise_up his rage . 
i decide i hate the person kid too , die in our kitchen while i be away where i could n't watch , die just to entertain person and make me go_up snap steps and down a drafty hall , pa lump under the cover at the end like dung cover with snow , snore and whistle . 
oh he 'd not care about the person kid . 
he 'd not care about getting wake so he could give_up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding_place in_the_bargain . 
that would make him mad enough if he be sober . 
i did n't hurry though it was cold and the person kid be in the kitchen . 
he be all shoveled_up like i think he 'd be . 
i push at his shoulder , call his name . 
i think his name stop the snoring but he did n't move except to roll a_little when i shove him . 
the cover slide down his skinny neck so i see his head , fuzzed like a dandelion go to seed , but his face was turn to the wall - there be the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster - and i think , well you do n't look_like much like a pig-drunk bully now . 
i could n't be sure he be still asleep . 
he be a cagey sonofabitch . 
i shake him a_little hard and make_noise some noise . 
`` pap-pap-pap-hey '' , i say . 
i was lean too far over . 
i know better . 
he always sleep close_to the wall so you had to lean to reach him . 
oh he be smart . 
it put_off you off . 
i know better but i was think_of the person kid mother-naked in all that dough . 
when his arm come_up i duck away but it catch me on the side of the neck , water my eye , and i back_off to cough . 
person be on his side , look at me , his eye wink , the hand that had hit me a fist in the pillow . 
`` get_out the hell out of here '' . 
i did n't say anything , try to get my throat clear , but i watch him . 
he be like a mean horse to come at from the rear . 
it be better , though , he 'd hit me . 
he be bitter when he miss . 
`` get_out the hell out of here '' . 
`` person send me . 
he tell me to wake you '' . 
`` a fat hell on person . 
get_out of here '' . 
`` he find the person kid by the crib '' . 
`` get_out the hell out '' . 
pa pull at the cover . 
he was taste his mouth . 
`` the kid 's freeze good . 
person is rub him with snow . 
he 's get him in the kitchen '' . 
`` person '' ? 
`` no , pa . 
it 's the person kid . 
the kid '' . 
`` nothing to steal from the crib '' . 
`` not steal , pa . 
he was just lie there . 
person find him freeze . 
that 's where he be when person find him '' . 
pa laugh . 
`` i ai n't hide nothing in the crib '' . 
`` you do n't understand , pa . 
the person kid . 
the kid '' - 
`` i god_damn well understand '' . 
pa had his head up , glare , his tooth gnaw at the place where he 'd grow a mustache once . 
`` i god_damn well understand . 
you know i do n't want to see person . 
that cock . 
why should i ? 
what did he come for , hey ? 
god_dammit , get . 
and do n't come_back . 
find_out something . 
you 're a fool . 
both you and person . 
person . 
that cock . 
do n't come_back . 
out . 
out '' . 
he was shout and breathe hard and close his fist on the pillow . 
he have long black hair on his wrist . 
they curl around the cuff of his nightshirt . 
`` person make me come . 
person say '' - 
`` a fat_hell on person . 
he 's an even bigger fool than you be . 
fat , hey ? 
i teach him , dammit , and i 'll teach you . 
out . 
you want me to drop my pot '' ? 
he was_about_to get_up so i get_out , slam the door . 
he was begin to see he be too mad to sleep . 
then he throw thing . 
once he go_after person and dump his pot over the banister . 
pa 'd be shit sick in that pot . 
person get an axe . 
he did n't even bother to wipe_off himself off and he chop_down part of pa 's door down before he stop . 
he might not have gone_that_far if pa had n't been lock in laugh fit to shake the house . 
that pot put pa in an awful good_humor whenever he think_of it . 
i always feel the memory be present in both of them , stir in their chest like a laugh or a growl , as eager as an animal to be out . 
i hear pa curse all_the_way downstairs . 
person had lay steaming towel over the kid 's chest and stomach . 
he was rub snow on the kid 's leg and foot . 
water from the snow and water from the towel had run off the kid to the table where the dough be , and the dough was turn pasty , stick_to the kid 's back and behind . 
`` ai n't he going_to wake_up '' ? 
`` what about your person '' ? 
`` he be awake when i leave '' . 
`` what 'd he say ? 
did you get the whisky '' ? 
`` he say a fat_hell on person '' . 
`` do n't be smart . 
did you ask him about the whisky '' ? 
`` yeah '' . 
`` well '' ? 
`` he say a fat_hell on person '' . 
`` do n't be smart . 
what 's he go_to do '' ? 
`` go_back to sleep most likely '' . 
`` you 'd best get that whisky '' . 
`` you go . 
take the axe . 
pa 's scare to hell of axe '' . 
`` listen to me , person , i 've have enough to your sassing . 
this kid 's freeze bad . 
if i do n't get some whisky down him he might die . 
you want the kid to die ? 
do you ? 
well , get your pa and get that whisky '' . 
`` pa do n't care about the kid '' . 
`` person '' . 
`` well he do n't . 
he do n't care at_all , and i do n't care to get my head bust neither . 
he do n't care , and i do n't care to have his shit fling on me . 
he do n't care about anybody . 
all he care about be his whisky and that dry crack in his face . 
get pig-drunk - that 's what he want . 
he do n't care about nothing else at_all . 
nothing . 
not person 's kid neither . 
that cock . 
not the kid neither '' . 
`` i 'll get the spirits '' , ma say . 
i 'd wind_up person up tight . 
i be ready to jump but when ma say she 'd get the whisky it surprise him like it surprise me , and he run_down . 
ma never go near the old_man when he was sleep_off . 
not anymore . 
not for year . 
the first thing every morning when she wash her face she could see the scar on her chin where he 'd cut her with a boot cleat , and maybe she see him heave it again , the dirty sock pop_out as it fly . 
it should have be nearly as easy for her to remember that as it be for person to remember go_after the axe while he was still spatter with pa 's yellow sick inside . 
`` no you won't '' , person say . 
`` yes , person , if they 're need '' , ma say . 
person shake his head but neither of us try to stop her . 
if we had , then one of us would have had to go instead . 
person rub the kid with more snow & & & rub & & & rub . 
`` i 'll get more snow '' , i say . 
i take the pail and shovel and go_out on the porch . 
i do n't know where ma go . 
i think she 'd go upstairs and expect to hear she had . 
she had surprise person like she had surprise me when she say she 'd go , and_then she surprise him again when she come_back so quick like she must have , because when i come_in with the snow she be there with a bottle with three white feather on its label and person was hold it angrily by the throat . 
oh , he was be queer and careful , paw about in the drawer and hold the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm . 
he be awful angry because he 'd think ma was going_to do something big , something heroic even , especially for her . 
i know him . 
i know him . 
we feel the same sometimes , while ma was n't think_about that at_all , not anything like that . 
there be no way of get_even . 
it be n't like getting cheat at the fair . 
they were always try so you got_to expect it . 
now person had give ma something of his - we both had when we think she was go straight to pa - something valuable ; but since she did n't know we 'd give it to her , there be no easy way of get_back it back . 
person cut the foil off finally and unscrew the cap . 
he was put_out too because there be only one way of understand what she 'd done . 
ma had find one of pa 's hiding_place . 
she 'd find one and she had n't say a word while person and i had hunt and hunt as we always did all winter , every winter since the spring that person had come and i had look in the privy and find the first one . 
pa have a knack for hiding . 
he know we were look and he enjoy it . 
but now ma . 
she 'd find it by_luck most likely but she had n't say anything and we did n't know how long_ago it 'd be or how many other ones she 'd find , say nothing . 
pa be sure to find_out . 
sometimes he did n't seem to because he hide them so well he could n't find them himself or because he look and do n't find anything and figure he had n't hide one after_all or had drink_up it up . 
but he 'd find_out about this one because we were use it . 
a fool could see what was go_on . 
if he find_out ma find it - that 'd be bad . 
he take_pride in his hiding . 
it be all the pride he have . 
i guess fool person and me take doing . 
but he did n't figure ma for much . 
he did n't figure her at_all , and if he find_out * * h a woman * * h it 'd be bad . 
person pour some in a tumbler . 
`` you going_to put more towel on him '' ? 
`` no '' . 
`` why not ? 
that 's what he need , something warm to his skin , do n't he '' ? 
`` not where he 's freeze good . 
heat 's bad for frostbite . 
that 's why i only put towel on his chest and belly . 
he 's_got to thaw slow . 
you ought to know that '' . 
color on the towel had run . 
ma poke her toe in the kid 's clothes . 
`` what are we going_to do with these '' ? 
person begin pour whisky in the kid 's mouth but his mouth fill without any get down his throat and in a second it was drip from his chin . 
`` here , help me prop_up him up . 
i got_hold his mouth open '' . 
i did n't want to touch him and i hope ma would do it but she keep look at the kid 's clothes pile on the floor and the pool of water by them and did n't make any move to . 
`` come_on , person '' . 
`` all_right '' . 
`` lift , do n't shove * * h lift '' . 
`` ok , i'm lift '' . 
i take him by the shoulder . 
his head flop back . 
his mouth fall_open . 
the skin on his neck be tight . 
he be cold all_right . 
`` hold_up his head up . 
he 'll choke '' . 
`` his mouth be open '' . 
`` his throat 's shut . 
he 'll choke '' . 
`` he 'll choke anyway '' . 
`` hold_up his head up '' . 
`` i can n't '' . 
`` do n't hold him like that . 
put your arm around him '' . 
`` well_jesus '' . 
he be cold all_right . 
i put my arm carefully around him . 
person have his finger in the kid 's mouth . 
`` now he 'll choke for_sure '' . 
`` shut_up . 
just hold him like i tell you '' . 
he be cold all_right , and wet . 
i had my arm behind his back . 
he be in his mid-fifties at this time , long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionize yet once_again , and it was almost a decade since he had swear_off lecturing . 
there was never a doubt anymore how his structure would be receive ; it was always the same unqualified success now . 
he could no_longer build anything , whether a private residence in his pennsylvania county or a church in brazil , without it be obvious that he had do it , and while here_and_there he was taken_to_task for again develop the same airy technique , they be such fanciful and sometimes even playful building that the public feel assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once establish by an artist as his private vision , be no_longer disputable as to its other value . 
person be internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine americana in foreign eye , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was make even more believably sincere by his personality . 
he had live for almost thirty year in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; he rise at half past six every morning , make himself some french coffee , have his corn_flake and more coffee , smoke four cigarette while read last sunday 's herald_tribune and yesterday 's pittsburgh_gazette , then put_on his high-topped farmer 's shoe and walk under a vine bower to his workshop . 
this be an enormously long building whose wall were make of rock , some of them bring home from every continent during his six year as an oil_geologist . 
the debris of his other career was pile everywhere ; a pile of wire cage for mouse from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lie on its side on the windowsill , vertical steel column wire for support to the open ceiling beam with spidery steel cantilever jut_out into the air , masonry construction on the floor from the time he was invent his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass_through a whole house , visible all_the_way up through wire grating on each floor . 
his file , desk , drafting_board and a high stool form the only clean island in the chaos . 
everywhere else his idea lie or hang in visible form : his model , drawing , ten foot canvas in monochrome from his painting day , and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed book that look as_though their inside had been ransack by a maniac . 
bicycle gearset he had once use as the basis of the design for the group plant hang on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hat , be a clean pair of roller_skate which he occasionally use up_and_down front of his house . 
he work stand , with his left hand in his pocket as_though he were merely stop for a moment , sketch with the surprised stare of one who was watch another person 's hand . 
sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him , sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil do what he disapprove . 
it all seem - if one could have peek in at him through one of his window - as_though this broken nosed man with the muscular arm and wrestler 's neck be merely the caretaker try his hand at the boss 's work . 
this air of disengagement carry_over to his apparent attitude toward his things , and people often mistake it for boredom in him or a surrender to repetitious routine . 
but he be not bored at_all ; he had find his style quite early in his career and he think it quite wonderful that the world admire it , and he could not imagine why he should alter it . 
there are , after_all , fortunate soul who hear everything , but only know how to listen to what be good for them , and person be , as thing go , a fortunate man . 
he leave his home the day after new_year's_day 's wear a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and without a hat . 
he would wear this same costume in florida , despite his wife person 's reminder over the past five day that he must take some cool clothes with him . 
but he be too busy to hear what she was say . 
so they part when she be in an impatient humor . 
when he was bend over behind the wheel of the station_wagon , feel in his trouser_cuff for the ignition_key which he had drop a moment before , she come_out of the house with an enormous rumanian shawl over her head , which she had buy in that country during one of their trip abroad , and hand him a clean handkerchief through the window . 
find the key under his shoe , he start the engine , and while it warm_up he turn to her stand there in the dripping fog , and say , `` defrost the refrigerator '' . 
he see the surprise in her face , and laugh as_though it be the funny expression he had ever see . 
he keep_on laugh until she start laugh with him . 
he have a deep voice which be full of good food she had cook , and good_humor ; an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it . 
he would settle himself into his seat to laugh . 
whenever he laugh it be all he was do . 
and she was make to fall_in_love with him again there in the rutted dirt driveway stand in the cold fog , mad as she be at his going_away when he really did n't have to , mad at their both get old in a life that seem to have take no more than a week to go_by . 
she be forty-nine at this time , a lanky woman of breeding with an austere , narrow face which have the distinction of a steeple or some architecture that had been design long_ago for a stubborn sort of prayer . 
her eyebrow be definite and heavy and form two line move upward toward a high forehead and a great head_of_hair of brown hair that fall to her shoulder . 
there be an air of blindness in her gray eye , the startled horse look that ultimately come to some woman who be_born at the end of an ancestral line long_since divorce from moneymaking and which , besides , has keep its estate intact . 
she be personally sloppy , and when she have cold would blow her nose in the same handkerchief all day and keep it , soak wet , dangle from her waist , and when she garden she would eat dinner with dirt on her calf . 
but just when she seem to have sink into some depravity of peasanthood she would disappear and come_down bathe , brush , and take_a_breath of air , and even with her broken nail her hand would come to rest on a table or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy , a grace of history , so_to_speak , and for an instant one see how ferociously proud she be and adamant on certain question of personal value . 
she even speak differently when she be clean , and she be clean now for his departure and her voice clear and rather sharp . 
`` now drive carefully , for_god's_sake '' ! she call , try to attain a half humorous resentment at his departure . 
but he did not notice , and was already back the car down to the road , say `` toot-toot '' ! to the stump of a tree as he pass it , the same stump which had impale the car of many_a guest in the past thirty year and which he refuse to have remove . 
she stand clutch her shawl around her shoulder until he had swing the car onto the road . 
then , when he had it point down the hill , he stop to gaze at her through the window . 
she had begin to turn_back toward the house , but his look catch her and she stand_still , wait there for what his expression indicate would be a serious word_of_farewell . 
he look at her out of himself , she think , as he did only for an instant at_a_time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellow a_little and his breath come hard through his nicotine choked lung , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly find herself stare at in the group on a thursday once . 
now she keep herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure_enough he point at her with his index_finger and say `` toot '' ! once_more and roar_off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it press the accelerator , just as his hand did when he work . 
she walk back to the house and enter , feel herself return , sensing some kind of opportunity in the empty building . 
there be a death in all parting , she know , and promptly put it out of her mind . 
she enjoy great party when she would sit_up talk and dance and drink all night , but it always seem to her that be alone , especially alone in her house , be the real part of life . 
now she could let out the three parakeet without_fear they would be step_on or that person would let them out one of the door ; she could dust the plant , then break_off suddenly and pick_up an old novel and read from the middle on ; improvise cha-cha on the harp ; and finally , the best part of all , simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine and the newspaper , read the ad as_well_as the news , register nothing on her mind but let her soul suspend itself above all wishing and desire . 
she do this now , comfortably aware of the mist run down the window , of the silence outside , of the dark afternoon it was get_to be . 
she fall_asleep lean_on her hand , hear the house creak as_though it be a live a private life of its own these two hundred year , hear the bird rustle in their cage and the occasional whirring of wing as one of them land on the table and walk across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm . 
every few minute she would awaken for a moment to review thing : person , yes , was on his way south , and the two boy be away in school , and nothing was burn on the stove , and person was come for dinner and bring three guest of hers . 
then she fall_asleep again as suddenly as a person with fever , and when she awake it be dark outside and the clarity be back in her eye . 
she stand_up , smooth her hair down , straighten her clothes , feel a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of person come_in or go_out , and yet , now that she was begin to cook , she glimpse a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain make her head writhe , and in_a_moment she find it hard to wait for person to come with her guest . 
she go_into the living_room and turn_on three lamp , then back into the kitchen where she turn_on the ceiling light and the switch that light the flood on the barn , illuminate the driveway . 
she know she was feel afraid and inwardly laugh at herself . 
they be both so young , after_all , so unready for any final parting . 
how could it have be thirty year already , she wonder ? 
but yes , nineteen plus thirty be forty-nine , and she be forty-nine and she had been marry at nineteen . 
she stand_still over the leg_of_lamb , rub herb into it , quite suddenly conscious of a nausea in her stomach and a feeling of wrath , a sensation of violence that start her shivering . 
but they all say , `` no , your time will come . 
enjoy be a bride while you can '' . 
there be no room for company in the tiny weaning_house ( where the person boy always take their bride , till they could get a house and a farm of their own ) . 
so when the big_house fill_up and run_over , the sister-in-law find bed for everyone in their own home . 
and there be still not anything that person could do . 
so person give_up ask , and accept her reprieve . 
without say so , she be really grateful ; for to attend the dying be something she had never experience , and certainly had not imagine when she think_of the duty she would have as person 's wife . 
she had make curtain for all the window of her little house , and she had keep it spotless and neat , shabby as it be , and cook good meal for person . 
she had do all the thing she had promise herself she would do , but she had not think_of this . 
people die , she would have say , in hospital , or in car on the highway at night . 
person be gone all day now , not come_in for dinner and sometimes not for supper . 
when they first marry he had been work in the field all day , and she would get_in the car and drive to wherever he was work , to take him a fresh hot meal . 
now there be no work in the field , nor would there be till it rain , and she did not know where he go . 
not that she complain , or have any cause to . 
four or five of the cousin from location be about his age , so naturally they run_around together . 
there be no reason for her to ask what they do . 
thus a new pattern of day begin to develop , for person did not die . 
she lie still on the bed , her head hardly dent the pillow ; sometimes she open her eye and look_around , and sometimes she take a_little milk or soup . 
they stop expect her to die the next minute , but only in the next day or two . 
those who had drive hundred of mile for the burial would not go_home , for she might die any time ; but they might as_well unpack their suitcase , for she might linger on . 
so the pattern was establish . 
when person had put_up her breakfast dish and mop her linoleum rug , she would go_to the big_house . 
there be not anything she could do there , but that be where everyone be , or would be . 
person and the boy would come_by , say `` how 's granny '' ? and sit on the porch a while . 
the older man would be there at noon , and maybe rest for a time before they take their gun off to the creek or drive down the road towards town . 
the woman and child stay_at the person ' . 
the woman , keep their voice low as they work around the house or sit in the living_room , sound like chicken shut_up in a coop for the night . 
the child had to play away from the house ( in the barn loft or the pasture behind the barn ) , to maintain a proper quietness . 
off_and_on , all day , someone would be wipe at the powdery gray dust that settle over everything . 
the evaporative_cooler had been move to granny 's room , and her door was keep shut ; so that the rest of the house stay open , though there be a question as to whether it be hot or cool that way . 
the dust clog their throat , and the heat parch them , so that the woman be always make ice_water . 
they had clean_up an old icebox and begin to buy fifty pound block of ice in town , as the electric_refrigerator come_near nowhere near provide enough ice for the crowd who eat and drink there . 
one afternoon , as the woman sit cluck softly , a new carload of people pull_up at the gate . 
it be a cadillac , black grayed with the dust of the road , its window closed tight so you know that the people who climb out of_it would be cool and unwrinkled . 
they be an old fat couple ( as person describe them to herself ) , a thick middle-aged man , and a girl about ten or twelve . 
there be much embracing , much exclaiming . 
`` person ! 
person '' ! 
`` person '' ! 
`` person '' ! 
`` and how be she '' ? 
`` about the same , person , about the same '' . 
all the woman get_up and offer their chair , and when they were all seated again , the guest make their inquiry and their explanation . 
`` we be on our vacation in canada '' , person explain , in a muffled voice that must have been used_to boom , `` and the news did n't catch_up_with us till we be nearly home . 
we come_on as_soon_as we could '' . 
there be the suggestion of ice_water , and - in_spite of the protest `` we 're not really thirsty '' - person , to escape the stuffy air and the smothering soft voice , hurry to the kitchen . 
she fill a big pitcher and set it , with glass , on a tray . 
carry it to the living_room , she imagine the picture she make : tall and roundly slim , a_bit sophisticated in her yellow sheath , with a graceful swingy walk that she had learn as a twirler with the school band . 
almost immediately she was ashamed of herself for feel vain , at such a time , in such a place , and she toss_back her long yellow hair , smile shyly as she enter the room . 
person ( the thick middle-aged man ) was look at her . 
she feel the look and look back because she could not help it , see that he be neither as old nor as thick as she had at_first believe . 
`` and who be this '' ? he ask , when she pass him a glass . 
`` oh that 's person '' , person say fondly . 
`` she marry our baby boy , person , this summer '' . 
`` let 's see '' , person say . 
`` he 's a right_smart young than the rest '' ? 
`` oh yes '' , mama laugh . 
`` he 's ten year young than person . 
we did n't expect him to come_along ; think for the long he be a tumor '' . 
this joke be not funny to person , and she blush , as she always did ; then , hear the muffled boom of person 's laughter , blush red . 
`` who be person , anyway '' ? she ask person that night . 
`` he make me uncomfortable '' . 
`` oh he 's a second_cousin or something . 
he get_in the oil_business out at odessa and luck_into some money '' . 
`` how old be he '' ? 
`` gosh , i do n't know . 
thirty-five , i guess . 
he 's be married and get this half grown kid . 
if he bother you , do n't pay him any mind . 
he 's just a big windbag '' . 
person was think_about something else . 
`` say , did you know they 're fix to have a two day antelope season on the double_x '' ? 
he was talk_about antelope again when they wake_up . 
`` listen , i never have a chance to kill an antelope . 
there never be a season before , but now they want to thin_out 'em out on_account_of the drouth '' . 
`` did he ever visit here when he be a kid '' ? 
person ask . 
`` who '' ? 
`` person '' . 
`` hell , i do n't know . 
when he be a kid i was n't around '' . 
person take a gun from behind the door , and with a quick `` bye_now '' be gone for the day . 
almost immediately person and his daughter person drive_up in the cadillac . 
`` we 're go_after ice '' , person say , `` and think maybe you 'd go along and keep_company us company '' . 
there be really no reason to refuse , and person had never ride in a cadillac . 
drive along the caliche-topped road to town , person talk . 
finally he say , `` tell me about yourself '' , and person tell him , because she think herself that she had had an interesting life . 
she be such a well-rounded teenager , having be a twirler , future_farmers sweetheart , and secretary of future_homemakers . 
in her sophomore year she had start go_steady with person , who be a football_player , future_homemakers sweetheart , and president of future_farmers . 
it be easy to see that they were make_for each other , and they know what they want . 
person would be a senior this year , and he plan to graduate . 
but there be no need for person to go_on , since all she want in life be to make a home for person and ( blush ) raise his child . 
person sigh . 
`` you lucky kid '' , he say . 
`` i 'd give anything if i could have find a girl like you '' . 
then he tell person about himself . 
of_course he could n't say much , really , because of person , but person could imagine what kind of woman his wife had be and what a raw_deal he had_got . 
it make her feel differently about person . 
she was going_to tell person about how mistaken she had be , but he bring one of the cousin home for supper , and all they do be talk_about antelope . 
person was try to get person to say she would cook one if he bring it home . 
`` cook a whole antelope '' ? she exclaim . 
`` why , i could n't even cook a piece of antelope steak ; i never even see any '' . 
`` oh , you could . 
i want to roast the whole_thing , and have it for the boy '' . 
person tell him he could n't do anything like that with his grandma die , and he say well they had_to eat , did n't they , they were n't all die . 
person feel_like go_off to the bedroom to cry ; but they were go_up to the big_house after supper , and she had_to put_on a clean dress and fix her hair a_little . 
every_night they all go_to mama and papa person 's , and sit on the open front_porch , where they could get the breeze . 
it be full-of-the-moon ( or a_little past ) , and nearly light as day . 
they all sit around and drink ice_water , and the man smoke , and everybody have a good time . 
once_in_a_while they say what a shame it be , with granny die , but they all agree she would n't have want it any other way . 
that night the older man got_to talk_about go possum hunting on a moonlight night . 
person and two or three of the other boy declare they had never be possum hunting , and person ( from person 's side of the family ) say he would just get_up from there and take them , right then . 
after they had leave , some of the people move around , to find more comfortable place to sit . 
there be not many chair , so that some prefer to sit on the edge of the porch , rest their foot on the ground , and_others like to sit where they could lean_back against the wall . 
person , who had been sit against the wall , say he need more fresh air , and take the spot on the edge of the porch where person had been sit . 
`` you 'll be a darn sight more comfortable there , person '' , person say , laugh , and they all laugh . 
person feel that she be not exactly more comfortable . 
person had been sit close to her , touch her actually , and hold her hand from_time_to_time , but it seem at_once that person sit much closer . 
perhaps it be just that he have so much more flesh , so that more of it seem to come in contact with hers ; but she had never been so aware of anyone 's flesh before . 
still she be not sorry he sit by her , but in_fact was flatter . 
he had become the center of the company , such story he have to tell . 
he had sell oil stock to person and person in_person ; he had help fight an oil_well fire that rage six day and night . 
`` but tell me , doctor , where do you plan to conduct the hatching '' ? 
person ask . 
`` that will have to be in the hotel '' , the doctor retort , confirm person 's anticipation . 
`` what i want you to do is to go_to the market with me early tomorrow morning and help smuggle the hen back into the hotel '' . 
the doctor pay the bill and they repair_to the hotel , room number nine , to initiate person further into these undertaking . 
the doctor open the smallest of his case , an unimposing straw bag , and expose the content for person 's inspection . 
inside , carefully pack in straw , be six egg , but the eye of a poultry psychologist was require to detect what scientifically valuable specimentalia lie inside ; to person they be merely six not unusual hen ' egg . 
there was little enough time to contemplate them , however ; in an instant the doctor was stalk across the room with an antique ledger in his hand , thoroughly eared and big as a tabletop . 
he place it on person 's lap . 
`` this be my hen ledger '' , he inform him in an absorbed way . 
`` it 's been go since 1908 when i be a junior in college . 
that first entry there be the vermont_flumenophobe , the early and one of the most successful of my eighty-three variety - great big scapular and hardly any primary at_all . 
could n't take them near a river , though , or they 'd squawk like a turkey_cock the day before thanksgiving '' . 
the ledger be full of most precise information : 
date of laying , length of incubation_period , number of chick reach the first week , second week , fifth week , weight of hen , size of rooster 's wattle and_so_on , all scrawl out in a hand that look more chinese than english , the most jagged and sprawling person had ever see . 
below these particular be a series of alpha beta gamma connect by arrow and cross which denote the lineage of the breed . 
person 's instruction be rapid , for the doctor had_to go_off to the group to hear more speech with only time for one sip of wine to sustain him through them all . 
but after the doctor 's return that night person could see , from the high window in his own room , the now familiar figure crouch on a truly impressive heap of towel , apparently give its egg hatching power one final chance before it was replace in its office by a sure-enough hen . 
a knocking at person 's door rouse him at six o'clock the following morning . 
it be the doctor , dressed and ready for the expedition to the market , and person was oblige to prepare himself in_haste . 
the doctor stand about , wait for person to dress , with a show of impatience , and soon they were move , as quietly as could be , through the still dark hallway , past the bedroom of the patronne , and so into the street . 
the market be not far and , once there , the doctor 's sense of immediacy leave him and he fall into a state of harmony with the bird around him . 
he stroke the hen and they respond with delighted cluck , he gobble with the turkey and they at_once be all attention , he quack with the duck , and cackle with a pair of exceedingly flatter goose . 
the dawn progress and it seem that the doctor would never be done_with his ministration when quite abruptly something break his revery . 
it be a fine broody_hen , white , with a maternal eye and a striking abundance of feather in the under region of the abdomen . 
the doctor , with the air of a man whose professional interest have find scope , draw person 's attention to those excellence which might otherwise have escape him : the fine color in comb and wattle , the length and quality of neck and saddle_hackle , the firm , wide spread of the toe , and a rare justness in the formation of the ear lappet . 
all search was end ; he had find his fowl . 
the purchase was effect and they make_one's_way towards the hotel again , the hen , with whom some sort of communication had been set_up , nestle in the doctor 's arm . 
the clock strike seven-thirty as they approach the hotel entrance ; and hope that the chambermaid and patronne would still be abed begin to rise in person 's well exercise breast . 
the doctor was wear a long new_england greatcoat , hardly necessary in the june weather but a garment which prove well adapted to the sequestration of hen . 
person enter first and was follow by the doctor who , for all his care , manifest a perceptible bulge on his left side where the hen was cradle . 
they advance in a line across the entrance_hall to the stairway and up , with gingerly step , towards the first landing . 
it was then that they hear the tread of one descend and , in some perturbation glance up , see the patronne come towards them as they gain the landing . 
`` bonjour , monsieur , vous etes matinals '' , she greet them pleasantly . 
person explain that they had been out for a stroll before breakfast while the doctor edge around behind him , attempt to hide the protuberance at his left side behind person 's arm and back . 
`` vous voulez vos petits dejeuners tout de suite alors '' ? their hostess enquire . 
person tell her that there be no hurry for their breakfast , try at_the_same_time to effect a speedy separation of the person before and behind him . 
the doctor , he notice , was attempt a transverse movement towards the stairs , but before the movement could be complete a distinct and audible cluck ruffle the air in the hollow of the stairwell . 
eye swerve in the patronne 's head , person cough loudly , and the doctor , with a sforzando of chicken noise float behind him , take to the stairs in long-shanked leap . 
`` comment '' ? ejaculate the surprised woman , look at person for an explanation but he , part from her without ceremony , only offer a_few words about the doctor 's provincial american speech and a state of nerves bring_on by the demand of his work . 
with_that he hurry up_the_stairs , follow by her suspicious gaze . 
when person enter his room , the doctor was already prepare a nest in the straw case , six egg ready for the hen 's attention . 
there be no reference to the incident on the stairs , his power being absorb by this more immediate business . 
the hen appear to have no doubt as to her duty and be quick to settle_down to the performance of them . 
one part of her audience be totally engaged , the connoisseur witness a peculiarly fine performance of some ancient classic , the other part , the guest of the connoisseur , attentive as one who must take an intelligent interest in_that which he does not fully understand . 
the spectacle progress towards a denouement which be obviously still remote ; the audience attend . 
time elapse but the doctor be obviously unconscious of its passage until an unwelcome knock on the door interrupt the process of nature . 
startled , he jump up to pull hen and case out of view , and person go_to the door . 
he open it a crack and in do so make_noise as as_much_as_possible shuffling , coughing , and scraping noise as possible in_order to drown emanation from the hen who had begin to protest . 
it be person , the fille_de_chambre , come to clean the room , and while she stand before him with ear prick_up and regard all curiosity , explain her errand , person could see from the corner of his eye the doctor do all he could to calm the displeased bird . 
person be reluctant but person succeed in persuade her to come_back in five minute and the door was shut again . 
`` who be that , young feller '' ? the doctor instantly ask . 
`` that be the fille_de_chambre , the one you think could n't get the egg out . 
she look mighty interested , though . 
anyhow she 's come_back in five minute to do the room '' . 
the doctor 's mind was work at a great speed ; he rise to put_on his greatcoat on and address person in a muted voice . 
`` have you have_got our key handy '' ? 
`` right in my pocket '' . 
`` all_right . 
now you go outside and beckon me when it 's safe '' . 
the hall be empty and person beckon ; they climb the stairs which creak , very_loudly to their sensitive ear , and reach the next floor . 
a guest was lock his room ; they pass behind him and get to person 's room unnoticed . 
the doctor sit_down rather wearily , caress the hen and remark that the city be not the place for a poultry loving man , but no_sooner be the remark out than a knock at this door oblige him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once_more . 
at the door person manage to persuade the increasingly astonished fille_de_chambre to return in ten minute . 
it be evident that a second transfer had to be effect , and that it had to take_place between the time the fille_de_chambre finish the doctor 's room and the time she begin person 's . 
they wait three minute and_then creep out on tiptoe ; the hall be empty and they pass down_the_stairs to number nine and listen at the door . 
a bustle of sheet being smooth and pillow being arrange indicate the fille_de_chambre 's presence inside ; they listen and suddenly a step towards the door announce another important fact . 
the doctor shoot_down to the lavatory and turn the doorknob , but to no effect : the lavatory be occupied . 
although a look of alarm pass_over his face , he did not arrest his movement but disappear into the shower_room just as the chambermaid emerge from number nine . 
person suppress those expression of relief which offer to prevail in his face and escape from his throat ; unwarranted they be in_any_case for , as he stand face the fille_de_chambre , his ear were assail by new sound from the interior of the shower_room . 
the event of the last quarter of an hour , mysterious to any bird accustom only to the predictable life of coop and barnyard , had overcome the doctor 's hen and she give_out a series of cackly wail , perhaps mourn her nest , but briefly enjoy . 
the doctor 's wit had not leave him , however , for all his sixty-eight years , and the wail were almost immediately lose in the sound of water rush_out from the showerhead . 
person nod to the maid as though nothing unusual were take_place and enter the doctor 's room . 
shortly , the doctor himself enter , his hair somewhat wet from the shower , but evidently satisfied with the outcome of their adventure . 
without comment he open the closet and from its shelf construct a highboard around the egg case which he had place on the floor inside . 
next , the hen was nest and all seem well . 
the two man sit for some time , savor the pleasure of escape from peril and the relief such escape bring , before they get_up and leave the hotel , the doctor to go_to the conference_house and person to go_to the main post_office . 
person return to the hotel , rather weary and with no new prospect of a role , in the late afternoon , but find the doctor in an ebullient mood . 
at the time person arrive he was engage in some sort of intimate communication with the hen , who had settle herself on the nest most peacefully after the occurrence of the morning . 
`` chicken have short memory '' , the doctor remark , `` that 's why they be better company than most people i know '' , and he go_on to break some important news to person . 
`` well '' , he begin , `` it seem like some people in paris want to hear more from me than those fellers over at the conference_house do . 
they 've get a big vulture from location at the zoo here , with a wife for him , too , very rare bird , both of them , the only vulturidae of their species outside africa . 
seem like she 's willing , but the male just flop around all day like the bashful boy who take person behind the barn and_then did n't know what to do , and the people at the zoo have n't get any vulture chick to show for their trouble . 
go downstairs with the tray , person wish he could have give_in to person , but he know better than to do what she say when she have that little girl look . 
there be time it be n't right to make a person happy , like the time she come_in the kitchen and ask for a peanut_butter sandwich . 
`` you know we do n't keep peanut_butter in_this house '' , he always tell her . 
`` why , person '' , she 'd cry , `` i just_now see you eat it out of the jar '' ! 
but he know how important it be for her to keep her figure . 
in the kitchen , person , his little young wife , was read the morning paper . 
her leg hang down long and thin as she sit on the high stool . 
`` here '' , person say gently , `` what 's these dish doing not washed '' ? 
the enormous plate which had hold person 's four fried_egg and five strip of bacon were still stack in the sink . 
`` leave me alone '' , person say . 
`` ca n't you see i'm busy '' ? 
she look at him impudently over the corner of the paper . 
`` this be moving day '' , person remind her , `` and i bet you leave thing every_which_way upstairs , your clothes all_over the floor and the bed not made . 
person '' ! 
his eye had fasten on her leg ; bend , he touch her knee . 
`` if i catch you one more time down here without stocking '' - 
she twitch her leg away . 
`` fuss , fuss , old_man '' . 
she have an alley_cat 's manners . 
person stack person 's thin pink dish in the sink . 
then he spread_out the last list on the counter . 
`` to be leave behind '' be printed at the top in person ; fine hand . 
person take_out a pencil , admire the point , and write slowly and heavily , `` clothes stand '' . 
sigh , person drop the paper and stand_up . 
`` i guess i better get ready to go '' . 
person watch her fumble to untie her apron . 
`` here '' . 
carefully , he undo the bow . 
`` how_come your bow be always cockeyed '' ? 
she turn and put her arm around his neck . 
`` i do n't want to leave here , person '' . 
`` now listen to that '' . 
he draw_back , embarrassed and pleased . 
`` i think you be sick_to_death of_this big house . 
say you wear_out yourself out , clean all these empty room '' . 
`` at_least there be room here '' , she say . 
`` what room be there going_to be in an apartment for any child '' ? 
`` i tell you what person 's doctor say '' . 
`` i do n't mean person ! 
what you think i care about that ? 
i mean our child '' . 
she sound as though they already exist . 
in_spite of the hundred thing he have on his mind , person went and put his arm around her waist . 
`` we 've got plenty of time to think_about that . 
all the time in_the_world . 
we 've only be married four year , january '' . 
`` four year '' ! she wail . 
`` that 's a long_time , wait '' . 
`` how many time have i tell you '' - he begin , and be almost glad when she cut_off him off - `` too many time '' ! 
- and flounce to the sink , where she begin noisily to wash her hand . 
too many time be the truth of_it , person think . 
he hardly believe his reason himself anymore . 
although it had seem a good reason , to_begin_with : no couple could afford to have child . 
`` how you going to work with a child hang_on you '' ? 
he ask person . 
`` you want to keep this job , do n't you '' ? 
he doubt whether she hear him , over the running water . 
he sit for_a_while with his hand on his knee , watch the bend of her back as she gather_up her thing - a comb , a bottle of aspirin - to take upstairs and pack . 
she make him sad some day , and he be never sure why ; it be something to do with her back , the thinness of_it , and the quick , jerky way she bend . 
she be too young , that be all ; too young and thin and straight . 
`` person '' ! 
it be person , bellow out in the hall . 
person hurry through the swinging_door . 
`` i 've been burst my lung for you '' , person complain . 
he was stand in_front_of the mirror , tighten his tie . 
he have_on his gray tweed overcoat and his city hat , and his briefcase lie on the bench . 
`` i do n't know what you think you 've been do about my clothes '' , he say . 
`` this coat look_like a rag heap '' . 
there be a_few blade of lint on the shoulder . 
person take the clothesbrush out of the closet and went to work . 
he give person a real going-over ; he brush his shoulder and his back and his collar with long , firm stroke . 
`` hey '' ! 
person cry when the brush tip his hat down over his eye . 
person apologize and quickly set the hat right . 
then he stand_back to look at person , who was pull on his pigskin gloves . 
person enjoy see him start_out ; he wear his clothes with style . 
when he was go_to town , nothing be good enough - he had curse at person once for leave a fleck of polish on his shoelace . 
at home , he would n't even wash his hand for supper , and he wander around the yard in a pair of sweaty old corduroys . 
the velvet smoking_jacket , pearl gray , wine , and blue , which person had buy him hang brushed and unworn in the closet . 
`` good-by , person '' , person say , give a final set to his hat . 
`` look_out for those mover '' ! 
person watch him hurry down the drive to his car ; a handsome , fine-looking man it make him proud to see . 
after person drive away , person go_on look out the window . 
he notice a speck of dirt on the sill and swipe at it with his finger . 
then he look at his finger , at the wrinkled , heavy knuckle and the thick nail he use like a knife to pry up , slit , and open . 
for_the_first_time , he let himself be sad about the move . 
that house be ten year off his life . 
each brass handle and hinge shine for his reward , and he know how to get_at the dust in the china flower and how to take_down the long glass drop which hang from the chandelier . 
he know the house like a blind_man , through his finger , and he did not like to think_of all the time and rag and polish he had spend on keep_up it up . 
ten year ago , he had come to the house to be interview . 
the tulip and the big pink peony had been bloom along the drive , and he had walk up from the bus almost sing . 
person had been out back , in a straw_hat , plant flower . 
she had talk to him right there , with the hot sun in his face , which make him sweat and feel ashamed . 
person had been surprised at her for that . 
still , he had like the way she had look , in a fresh , neat cotton dress - citron yellow , if he remember . 
she had have a dignity about her , even barefoot and almost too tan . 
since then , the flower she had plant had spread all_over the hill . 
already the jonquil were bloom in a flock by the front gate , and the periwinkle were come_on , blue by the porch steps . 
in a week the hyacinth would spike_out . 
and the dogwood in early may , for person 's alfresco party ; and after that the japanese_cherry . 
now the yard look wet and bald , the tree bare under their bud , but in a while person 's flower would bloom like a marching parade . 
she had dig a hole for each bulb , each tree wear a tag with her writing on_it ; where would she go for her gardening now ? 
somehow person did n't think she 'd take_to window_box . 
sigh , he hurry to the living_room . 
he had a_thousand thing to see to . 
still , he could n't help think , we 're all get old , get small ; the snail is pull_in her horn . 
in the living_room , person was stand by the window with a sheaf of list in her hand . 
she was look out at the garden . 
`` person '' , she say , `` get the basket for the breakable '' . 
person had the big straw basket ready in the hall . 
he bring it in and put it down beside her . 
person was look fine ; she have_on her easter suit , blue , with lavender binding . 
halfway across the house , he could have smell her morning perfume . 
it hang_in all her day clothes , sweet and strong ; sometimes when he was press , person raise her dress to his face . 
frown , person study the list . 
`` well , let 's see . 
the china lemon_tree . 
the alabaster cockatoo '' . 
person follow her around the room , collect the small frail object ( christmas , birthday , and anniversary ) and wrap them in tissue_paper . 
neither of them trust the mover . 
when they come to person 's photograph , twenty by twelve inch in a curly silver frame , person say , `` by_rights i ought to leave that , see he won n't take my clotheshorse '' . 
she smile at person , and he see the hateful hard glitter in her eye . 
he pick_up the photograph and begin to wrap it . 
`` at_least you could leave it for the mover '' , person say . 
`` what possessed you to tell me a clotheshorse would be a good idea '' ? 
person fold the tissue_paper carefully . 
`` he 's use it every_day ; every morning , i lay_out his clothes on_it '' . 
`` well , that 's over now . 
and it be his main present ! 
leave that fool picture out '' , she add sharply . 
person lay it in the basket . 
`` person set store by that '' . 
`` really , person . 
it was mean to be my present '' . 
but she go_on down the list . 
person be relieved ; those present had been on his mind . 
he had only agree with person about get the valet , but he had actually suggest the photograph to person . 
`` you know what she like , person '' , he had say wearily , one evening in november when person was pull_off his overshoe . 
`` tell me what to get her for christmas '' . 
`` she 's been talk_about a picture '' , person had tell him . 
`` picture ! 
you mean picture of me '' ? 
but person had persuade him . 
on christmas night , they had had a disagreement about it . 
person had hear because he was set_up the liquor tray in the next room . 
through the door , he had see person walk_around , wait for person . 
finally she had come_down ; person had hear her shake out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess gown . 
`` how do you like it '' ? she had ask . 
person had say , `` you look about fifteen year old '' . 
`` is that a compliment '' ? 
`` i do n't know '' . 
he had stand at a_little distance , study her , as though he would walk_around next and look at the back of her head . 
`` lovie , you make me feel naked '' . 
person had giggle , and she go sweep and rustle to the couch and sink down . 
`` you look like that picture i have at the office '' , person had start . 
`` not a line , not a wrinkle . 
i look_like an old_man , compare '' , and he had pick_up his photograph with the red christmas bow still on_it . 
`` look , an old_man . 
will you wear pink when you 're sixty '' ? 
`` darling , i love that photograph . 
i'm going_to put it on my dresser '' . 
`` i guess it 's child make a woman old . 
a man get old anyhow '' . 
after a minute he go_on , `` people must think the curse be on me , see you fresh as an apple and me old and gray '' . 
`` i 'll give you a medical certificate , frame , if you like '' , person had say . 
`` no . 
all i want be a picture - with a_few line . 
make the man put them in if he has to '' . 
after that they had sit for five minute without say a word . 
then person had stand_up , rustle and rustle , and go upstairs . 
was it love ? 
i have no_doubt that it be . 
during the rest of the summer my scholarly mania for make plaster_cast and spatter print of location flower and leaf was all_but surpass by the constantly renew impression of person that my mind serve_up to me for contemplation and delight . 
nothing in_all the preceding year had have the power to bring me close to a knowledge of profound sorrow than the breakup of camp , the packing away of my camp uniform , the severing of tie with the six or ten people i had grow most to love in the world . 
in final separation from them , in the railroad_terminal across the river from new_york , i would nearly cry . 
my parent ' welcoming arm would seem woeful , inadequate , unwanted . 
but that year be different , for just as the city , in the form of my street clothes , had intrude upon my mountain night , so an essential part of the summer give promise of continue into the fall : person and i , about to be separate not by a mere footbridge or mess_hall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of reside in cruelly distant borough , had agree to correspond . 
these letter become the center of my existence . 
i live to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock_in myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an answer . 
my memory have catalogue for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink , scented stationery and the unsloped , almost printed configuration of her neat , studious handwriting with which she invite me to recall our summer , so many sentence begin with `` remember when '' ; and_others concern camp friend who reside in her suburban neighborhood , and news of her commence again her piano_lesson , her private_school , a visit to boston to see her grandparent and an uncle who be a surgeon return on furlough , wounded , from the war in europe . 
in my letter i take_on a personality that differ from the self i know in real_life . 
then epistolatory me be a foreign correspondent dispatch exciting cable and communique , full of dash and wit and glamor , quote from the book i read , imitate the grand style of the author recommend by a teacher in whose special , after-school class i was enrol . 
the letter take their source from a stream of my imagination in which i was transform into a young_man not unlike my bunkmate person - he of the porch steps anecdote - who smoke cigarette , perform the tango , wear fifty dollar suit , and sneak_off into the dark with girl to do unimaginable thing with them . 
like person , in my fantasy , i have a proud bearing and , with a skill that be vaguely continental , i would lead person through an evening of dancing and handsome description of my newest exploit , would guide her gently to the night 's climax which , in my dream , was always represent by our almost suffocate one another to death with deep , moist kiss burn with love . 
the night after read her letter about her surgeon uncle - it must have be late in september - i have a vision of myself return in ragged uniform from the front , nearly die , my head bandaged and bloody , and person bend over me , the power of her love bring me back to life . 
for many night afterward , the idea of her having been so close to me in_that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desire , would cause me to lie_awake in shame , toss with irresolution , long to fall_asleep into a deep sleep . 
the week go_by , and the long our separation grow , the more unbounded and almost unbearable my fantasy become . 
they cause my love for person to become warm and at_the_same_time more hopeless , as if my adolescent self know that only torment would ever bring me the courage to ask to see her again . 
as it turn_out , person took matter into her own hands . 
having receive permission to give a camp reunion halloween party , she ask that i come and be her date . 
i go and , mum and nervous , all_but make a fool of myself . 
again among those jubilantly reunite bunkmate , i be shy with person and act as i had during those early saturday morning when we all seem to be playing_for_effect , to be detached and unconcerned with the girl who be properly our date but about whom , later , in the privacy of our bunk , we would think in_terms_of the most elaborate romance . 
i remember stand in a corner , watch person act the hostess , serve soft_drink to her guest . 
she was wear her dark hair in two , thick braid to attain an `` american_girl '' effect she think be appropriate to halloween . 
it make her look sweet and schoolgirlish , i be excited to be with her , but i did not know how to express it . 
yet a moment did come that night when the adventurous letter_writer and fantasist seem to stride off my flashy page , out of my mind , and plant himself in reality . 
it be late , we were play kissing game , and person and i call_on to kiss in_front_of the others . 
we blush and were fluster , and it turn_out to be the fleet brush of lip upon cheek . 
the kiss outrage our friend but it was do and meanwhile had release in me all the remote , exciting premonition of lust , all the mysterious sensation that i had imagined a truly consummated kiss would convey to me . 
it be at that party that , finally overcome my timidity , inspire by tale only half understood and overhear among old boy , i ask person to spend new_year's_eve with me . 
lovingly , she accept , and so great be my emotion that all i could think_of say be , `` you 're amazing , you_know '' ? 
later , we agree to think_of how we wish to spend that night . 
we would write to one another and make a definite plan . 
she be terribly pleased . 
among my school and neighborhood friend , during the next month , i brag and swagger and pompously describe my impending date . 
but though i boast and give_off a dapper front , i be beneath_it_all frightened . 
it would be the first time i had ever be completely alone with a girl i love . 
i have no idea of_what subject one discuss when alone with a girl , or how one behave : 
should i hold her hand while walk or only when cross the street ? 
should i bring along a corsage or send one to her ? 
was it preferable to meet her at home or in the city ? 
should i accompany her to the door of her home , or should i ask to be invite in ? 
in or out , should i kiss her good_night ? 
all this be unknown to me , and yet i had dare to ask_out her out for the most important night of the year ! 
when in one letter person inform me that her father did not like the idea of her go_out alone on new_year's_eve , i know for a moment an immense relief ; but the letter go_on : she had cry , she had implore , she had be miserable at his refusal , and finally he had relent - and now how happy she be , how expectant ! 
her optimism give me heart . 
i force confidence into myself . 
i make inquiry , i read a book of etiquette . 
in december i write her with_authority that we would meet on the steps of the location , a rendezvous spot that i had learn be the most sophisticated . 
we would attend a film and , later_on , i state , we might go to the location or location 's or location 's for waffle . 
i set the hour of our meeting for seven . 
at five o'clock that night it be already dark , and behind my closed door i was dress as carefully as a groom . 
i wear a new double-breasted brown worsted suit with a faint herringbone design and wide lapel like a devil 's ear . 
my camp made leather wallet , bulky with twisted , raised stitch around the edge , i stuff with money i had been save . 
hatless , in an overcoat of rough blue wool , i was give a proud farewell by my mother and father , and i set_out into the strangely still street of brooklyn . 
i feel superior to the neighborhood friend i was leave_behind , feel old than my years , and be full of compliment for myself as i head into the subway that was carry its pack of passenger out of_that dull borough and into the unstable , tantalizing excitement of manhattan . 
location , when i ascend to_it with my fellow subway traveller ( all dress as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we be all distant member ) , be nearly impassable , the sidewalk swarming_with celebrant , with bundled-up sailor and soldier already hug their girl and their rationed bottle of whiskey . 
heavy-coated , severe looking policeman sit astride noble horse along the curbside to prevent the reveller from spill_out in_front of the crawling traffic . 
the night be cold but the crowd keep one warm . 
the giant electric sign and marquee were light_up for_the_first_time since blackout regulation had been institute , and the atmosphere be alive with the feeling that victory be just around_the_corner . 
cardboard noisemaker , substitute for the unavailable tin model , were being hawk and buy at makeshift stand every few yard along location , and one 's ear were continually serenade by the horn ' rasp and bleat . 
an old gentleman next to me hold a boy_scout bugle to his lip and blast away at every fourth step and during the interim shout_out , `` v for victory '' ! 
his neighbor cheer him on . 
there be a great sense of camaraderie . 
how did one join them ? 
where were they all walk to ? 
was i supposed to buy a funny hat and a rattle for person ? 
it be a quarter of seven when the crowd washed_me_up among the other gallant who had establish the location steps as the beachhead from which to launch their night of merrymaking . 
i look over their face and feel a twinge : they all look so much more knowing than i . 
i look_away . 
i look_for person to materialize out of the clogging , curdling crowd and , as the time pass and i wait , a fiend came_to_life beside me and whisper in my ear : how was i plan to greet person ? 
where exactly would we go after the movie ? 
suppose the line in_front_of the movie_house be too long and we could n't get_in ? 
suppose i had n't bring along enough money ? 
i feel for my wallet . 
its thick , substantial outline calm me . 
but when i see that it be already ten past seven , i begin to wonder if something had go_wrong . 
suppose her father had change his mind and had refuse to let her leave ? 
suppose at this very moment her father was call my house in an effort to cancel the plan ? 
i grow uneasy . 
all about me there be a hectic interplay of meeting take_place , like abrupt , jerky scene in old silent_movie , joyous greeting and beginning , hugging and kissing , enthusiastic forays into the festive night . 
whole platoon were take_up new position on the steps , arrive and depart , while i stay glued , like a signpost , to one spot . 
at 7 : 25 two hotel doorman come thump down the steps , carry a sawhorse to be set_up as a barricade in_front_of the haberdashery_store window next to the entranceway , and as i watch them in their gaudy red coat that nearly scrape the ground , their golden , fringed epaulet and spic , red visored cap , i suddenly see just over their shoulder person gracefully make_one's_way her way through the crowd . 
my heart almost stop beat . 
`` right '' , say the fingerprint_man . 
`` also , if you 're going_to believe those fingerprint , you 'll have to look_for a killer who 's a top-grade piano_player '' . 
he demonstrate by play an imaginary piano , do a staccato passage with a broadly exaggerated attack . 
to make it clear he shift to act_out , but with no change of manner , the killing of person . 
his hand snatch at an imaginary bucket , swoop down hard to grab it and come_away with equal snap like a ball that 's been bounce hard . 
in the same way he pantomime grasp a mantel and bounce cleanly off that , press his hand against the floor and bounce cleanly off that . 
he was move like a ballet_dancer , play for laugh . 
if person 's killer act this way , catch_up_with him was going_to be a cinch . 
we 'd know him by his stretch_pants and the flower he 'd wear twine in his hair . 
perhaps if person had first come_upon us when this boy was not cavort so gaily up_and_down the hall outside the murdered woman 's apartment , we might have have less trouble convince person of our seriousness . 
this , you will remember , be still new_year's_day . 
by the time person turn_up it be early afternoon , which , one would think , would be late enough so that by then , except for small child and a_few hardy soul who had not_yet sober_up , it could have been expect that people would no_longer be have any sort of active interest in the previous night 's noisemaker and paper hat . 
person be the exception . 
he had retain his hat and his horn , and , whatever fun might still be go , he be ready to join it . 
that , incidentally , might give you some idea of what person be like . 
after_all , he had n't happen_upon us in_that second floor hall without warning . 
the me 's boy had finish their on-the-spot examination and the body had been remove for autopsy . 
the meat wagon , therefore , be not out in_front of the house anymore , but the cluster of squad_car be still there and there be a cop on the door downstairs to screen any coming and going . 
there be , furthermore , the crowd of curious onlooker gather in the street and a couple more cop to hold them at a decent distance . 
just put yourself in person 's place for a moment . 
you 're a taxpayer , householder , landlord . 
you 've been away from home for the new_year's_eve festivity , but now the party be over and you come home . 
define sobriety in the limited sense of be free from the clinical symptom of the effect of alcohol ingest and not_yet eliminate from the system , you be sober . 
you still have your paper hat and you 're wear it , but then , it be an extraordinary paper hat and , in_addition to anything else you may be , you be also the sculptor who create that most peculiar dame out in the backyard . 
it 's not too_much to assume that you will have a more lasting interest in paper hat than will person . 
you have your paper horn clutch in your big , craggy fist , and for your entrance you have plan a noisy , colorful and exuberant greeting to your friend and tenant . 
you find your house a focus of public and police attention . 
can you imagine yourself forget under_the_circumstances that you are approach this startling and unexpected situation so unsuitably hat and armed with a paper horn ? 
maybe one could be startle into forgetfulness . 
you shoulder your way through the cluster of the curious and you barge up to the cop on the door . 
you identify yourself and ask him what 's go_on . 
instead of answer you , he stick his head in the door and shout up_the_stairs . 
`` get the upstairs guy '' , he bellow . 
`` the owner . 
do i send him up '' ? 
then he turn_back to you . 
`` go_on in '' , he say . 
`` they 'll tell you what 's cooking '' . 
even then , as you go_into the house oppressed by the knowledge that something_is_cooking and that your house has pass under this unaccountable , official control , could you go_on forget that you still have_on that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still carry that childish horn in your hand ? 
what i'm get at be that we be fully prepared for person 's be an odd one . 
we 'd see his handiwork out in the backyard , and the little his tenant had tell us of him did make him sound a_little special . 
we were not , however , prepare_for anything like the apparition that confront us as person come_up the stairs . 
he , of_course , must have been equally unprepared for what confront him , but , nonetheless , i did find his reaction startling . 
if person was still wear the hat and carry the horn because he 'd forget about them , he now remember . 
he come bound up_the_stairs and join the dance . 
he adjust the hat , lift the horn to his lip as_though it be a flute , and fall_in alongside our fingerprint_expert to cavort with him . 
our man stop_dead and glower at person . 
person throw his head back and laugh a laugh that shake the timber of even that solidly built old house . 
this be a bull of a man . 
he be big-chested , big-shouldered and heavy-armed . 
his face be ruddy and heavy and unlined , and when he laugh he show his tooth , which be big and white and strong and unquestionably homegrown . 
i do n't remember ever see tooth that be quite so white and at_the_same_time quite so emphatically not denture . 
his hair had recede most of the way to the back of his neck . 
he have only a fringe of hair and he wear it crop short . 
it be almost as white as his tooth . 
for a man of his mass he be curiously short . 
he be n't a dwarf but he be a_bit of a comic figure . 
a man with so big and so staggeringly developed a torso and such long and powerful arm is expect to stand tall than five foot five . 
for person it be a_bit of a stretch to make even that measurement . 
the man be just this side of be a freak . 
we wait till he had finish laugh , and that give us a_few moment for take_stock of him . 
he be dressed in a manner esquire might suggest for the outdoor_man 's country weekend . 
dark gray sports_jacket , light gray slacks , pink flannel shirt , black silk necktie . 
his eye be clear . 
he be freshly shaved , and if there had been any alcohol in him we could never have miss detect some scent of_it on the massive gust of his laughter . 
not even a whiff . 
eventually he subside . 
`` person '' ? 
person say . 
`` me '' , he say merrily . 
`` me , the happy one '' . 
`` that_much latin we remember '' , person say dryly . 
`` you always live_up_to your name , always like this , always make_happy '' ? 
`` i try '' , person say blithely . 
`` the world be full of bloke who put their heart into make the tragic scene . 
i 've never notice that it improve thing any '' . 
`` bully for you '' , person say . 
`` what 's the rest of your name '' ? 
`` no rest of_it . 
person be all there be '' . 
`` all there ever be '' ? 
`` the past i leave to historian '' , person intone , demonstrate that he could be pompous as_well_as happy . 
`` you live in the present '' ? 
`` in the present '' , person proclaim . 
`` for the future . 
is there any other time in which a man can live '' ? 
`` we '' , person announce , `` be not philosopher . 
we be person . 
this gentleman be a police_officer . 
he be a fingerprint_specialist . 
could your future , your immediate future , be make to include take us upstairs , give us a_bit of space in which our friend can work , and make available to him your fingertip '' ? 
the happy one could never have look happy . 
this be more_than joy . 
it be ecstasy . 
`` those lovely whorl '' , he chortle . 
`` so intricate , so beautiful . 
come_right_along . 
i love fingerprint '' . 
he was prance along the hall , head for the next flight_of_stairs . 
person call him back . 
`` we 're here because of_what happen last night '' , he say . 
`` past , yes , but important . 
since it be important , for the record let 's have the full name '' . 
`` that important '' ? 
person ask . 
`` that important '' . 
`` person '' , person whisper . 
`` person '' ? 
person ask , not bother to whisper . 
`` shh '' , person implore . 
`` i can n't see what would make it necessary for you to know . 
nothing could make it necessary to proclaim it to the whole world '' . 
obligingly person lower his voice . 
`` person '' ? 
he repeat . 
`` no . 
person , but not for year . 
for year it 's been just person . 
first thing i did after my twenty-first birthday be go_into court and have it officially change , and this be something i do n't tell everybody . 
that be almost forty year ago '' . 
having volunteer that he be a man of about sixty , he bound up_the_stairs and with each leap render the number less credible . 
this be a broth_of_a_boy , our person , and nothing be more obvious than the joy he take in demonstrate how agile he be and how full of juice and spirit . 
we follow him up_the_stairs . 
the cop would gather_up person and the foursome on the third floor and bring us those of them who would voluntarily submit to fingerprinting . 
you may think we did n't need person and person , but you always get what you can when you can , and we have no guarantee that a fingerprint record on them could n't be useful before we were through_with this case . 
also , if we had exclude the lady we would have_to that extent let the whole world know at_least that much of where we stand . 
the killer , if in our present group , would certainly be interested in know that much , and even_though with the fingerprint evidence what it be i could see no way he could use this bit of information to improve on his situation , there might always be some way . 
if you can possibly avoid it , you do n't hand_out any extra chance . 
person take us into his studio . 
it be that oddly shaped space at the very top of the house , where ceiling height had to accommodate themselves to the varying angle of roof slope . 
at each angle of its pitch a big skylight had been fit into the roof and all these skylight were fit with system of multiple screen and shade . 
when person first open the door on_it , all these shade were tightly draw and the whole studio be as dark as night . 
he quickly fix that , roll back the shade on some of the skylight and adjust screen on the others . 
he fly about the place make these adjustment and it be obvious that what he was do be the fruit of long experience . 
none of his movement be tentative . 
there be no process of trial_and_error . 
start with the room completely black_out , as it be when we come_in , he unerringly fix thing so that the whole place was bathe in the maximum of light without at any point admit even so much as a crack of glare . 
expect something more_than average wacky , i was surprise by what we find . 
there be no display of either work_in_progress or of finished work . 
here_and_there on work_table or pedestal stand a shape with a sheet or a tarpaulin drape over it . 
these shape might have be mad , but there be no tell . 
they were all completely shroud . 
the equipment be solid and heavy and in good condition . 
everything be orderly and it seem to be arrange for the workman 's comfort , convenience and efficiency . 
there be tool about but they were neatly keep . 
there be no confusion and no litter . 
supplies of sheet_metal were neatly stacked in bin . 
person did not see the newspaper the next day . 
someone on his staff - he suspect it be person - intercept them and for this person be grateful . 
he finally fall_asleep around six in the morning with the aid of a sleeping_capsule , a crutch he rarely use , and did n't awaken until early afternoon . 
memory flood him the instant he open his eye and the sick feeling knot his stomach . 
outside his window bloom a beautiful summer day . 
presumably the same sun was shine upon little person also , and those who had kidnap him . 
but where ? 
it be still a very big world , despite all the modern cant to_the_contrary . 
person was sit in a chair that block the hall door . 
he was doze , perhaps the only sleep he 'd get . 
he snap to alertness at person 's entrance . 
`` sorry , person . 
nothing new . 
a_lot of people wait to see you , though '' . 
`` reporter '' ? 
`` our own people . 
question about the show tonight '' . 
person pick_up the telephone . 
`` shall i let them know you 're awake '' ? 
`` i suppose . 
how 's person , do you know '' ? 
person consider . 
`` some better . 
she 's got plenty of guts , person . 
you want me to call her '' ? 
`` she expect me to '' ? 
person shake his head so person tell him not to bother . 
the only reason for contact person be to comfort or to be comfort . 
he could not manage the former or expect the latter ; they have nothing to give to each other . 
the omission might look peculiar to outsider , but person could not bring_oneself himself to go_through_the_motions simply for the sake of appearance . 
he have little time to himself , anyway . 
as the afternoon speed toward evening , the suite see a steady procession of person aide pass in and out , each with his own special problem . 
person arrive with the writer . 
they had spend the morning revise the act , eliminate all the gay song , patter and dancing with a view of the best public_relations . 
what remain lack the original verve but it be at_least dignified , as befit the tragic circumstance . 
person report that the orchestra had hastily rehearse `` cradle_song '' in_case it be needed . 
person be back_and_forth on several occasion , first to confer_with person on the advisability of cancel the las_vegas engagement - they decide it be wise - and later to announce that a prominent comedian , also an agency client , had agree to fill the casino 's open date . 
and once person slip in , pale and drawn , last night 's liquor still on his breath with some of today 's add to_it . 
he ask if there be anything he could do . 
person invent a job to keep him busy , send him ahead to location to supervise last-minute arrangement . 
but from location , they hear nothing . 
at_last it was time to depart . 
person , nose about , spot reporter in the lobby , so person was hustle away quietly through the hotel 's service_entrance in a strange car which person had procure somewhere . 
they succeed in elude the curious at the hotel , but there be no chance of avoid them at the nightclub . 
location was surround by a mob . 
they overflow the parking_lot , make progress by automobile difficult . 
long before he reach the protection of the stage_door , person was recognize . 
word of his arrival spread through the crowd like a brush_fire . 
they surge around him , finger point , eye pry . 
it be not a hostile gathering but person sense the difference from last night 's hero_worshipper . 
they had come not to admire but to observe . 
`` it 's worse inside '' , person inform person . 
`` person 's jam in every table he could find . 
under the heading of_it 's an ill wind , etcetera '' . 
backstage be tomb like by contrast . 
person 's co-worker keep their distance , awed by the tragedy . 
but in his dressing_room be a large bouquet and a card that read , `` we 're with you all_the_way '' . 
it was sign by everyone in the troupe . 
person could n't help but be touched . 
he instruct person to compose a note of thanks to be post on the call-board . 
person was wait to report that person had been sober_up to the point where he could function efficiently . 
person gather that this had be no small accomplishment . 
person himself look better ; any kind of job be better than brood . 
person tell him , `` person , i wish you 'd talk to person , see if some kind of pa_system can be rig_up outside . 
it 's just barely possible with this crowd that the kidnapper was n't able to get a table . 
i would n't want him to miss the message '' . 
`` i 'll try . 
person is n't going_to like it much , though , give_away what he should be sell '' . 
person be n't the only one who did n't care_for person 's scheme . 
a short time later , person stomp into the dressing_room . 
`` i got_a_bone_to_pick with you , person . 
it 's those damn loudspeaker '' . 
person roll_up the revised script he had been study . 
`` what about them '' ? 
`` they 're going_to louse_up me up good . 
my men have be here all afternoon , set_up for this thing '' . 
person explain that , with the nightclub 's cooperation , the police had occupy location like a battlefield . 
motion_picture camera had been install to film the audience , the reservation list was being check_out name by name , and a special detail be already at_work in the parking_lot scrutinize automobile for a possible lead . 
however , it was virtually impossible to screen the mob outside , even if person have manpower available for the purpose . 
`` i want you to have the speaker take_out '' . 
person sigh . 
`` seem like we 're never going to see_eye_to_eye , lieutenant . 
did n't they tell you what i want the pa_system for '' ? 
`` sure , i know . 
but it 's such a long_shot '' - 
`` no long than yours . 
what do you expect to get tonight , anyway ? 
you think somebody is going_to stand_up in the audience and make guilty face ? 
or have a sign on his car that say , ' here come the location kidnapper '' ' ? 
person crumble the script in his fist . 
`` i can n't stop you from do what you think be right . 
but do n't try to stop me , either '' . 
`` someday '' , person say , `` you 're going_to ask us for help . 
i can hardly wait '' . 
`` what you do n't understand be that i'm ask for it now '' . 
but person depart , still full of ill_will . 
he had gotten stuck_with a job too big for his imagination ; he had to cling_to routine , tested procedure . 
to act otherwise would be to admit his helplessness . 
but , admit or not , person be helpless . 
the crime show too much planning , the kidnapper appear too proficient to be catch by a checklist . 
person 's performance was schedule for eleven o'clock . 
he stall for a half-hour longer , hope to hear something from person about the ransom_money . 
person and person , on separate telephone , could not reach him at any conceivable location in los_angeles , nor could they secure any clear-cut information regard his effort . 
person curse . 
`` the sweaty bastard 's probably halfway to peru with our money by now '' . 
when no one smile , he feel constrained to add , `` just kid , natch '' . 
person pop_in to advise , `` person , person 's sending_up_smoke_signals . 
you about ready '' ? 
`` what 's he complain about '' ? 
person ask . 
`` they 're drink , are n't they '' ? 
`` no . 
we got a bunch of sipper out there tonight . 
i guess nobody want to pass_out and miss anything '' . 
person add in a low voice but person overhear , `` they act more like a jury than an audience '' . 
person say , `` well , i guess we can n't wait any longer . 
person , you stick by the stage_door . 
if person show_up during the number - or you hear anything - give me the signal '' . 
person say , `` i 'll stay on the phone , person . 
there 's a_couple_of call-back i can work_on '' . 
`` you be a sweetheart - but leave one line open . 
he may try to phone us '' . 
person pass into the corridor , their `` good_lucks '' ! follow him . 
it be what they say before every performance but tonight it sound differently , as if he really need it . 
they be right . 
the act , cut to shred and hastily patch together during the afternoon , had not been rehearse sufficiently by anyone . 
the result have nothing of the polish , pace or cohesion of the previous night . 
here 's where luck would normally step_in . 
but this be no ordinary show and person know it . 
whether he sing well or badly have nothing to do with_it . 
the audience had come not to be entertain but to judge . 
twenty-four_hours had change him from a performer to a freak . 
within this framework , what follow be strained , even macabre . 
eliminate the patter and the upbeat number leave little but blues and other song of equal melancholy . 
the effect be as depressing as a gravestone , the applause irresolute and short-lived . 
yet person plow_ahead , mouth the inconsequential words as if they possess real meaning , and gradually his listener warm_to him . 
their clapping grow more fervent ; the evening be still not beyond salvage , not as a show but for him as a person . 
the worst be yet to come . 
as person reach the finale of his act , a subdued commotion backstage draw his attention to the wing . 
person - a perspiring , haggard person - was stand there , flank by two man in the uniform of armored transport guard . 
person was nod and point at the large suitcase he hold . 
person feel his heart thud heavily with relief . 
he wave at person to cut_off the finale introduction . 
the music die_away discordantly . 
he draw a deep breath . 
`` lady and gentleman , in_place_of my regular closing number tonight , i 'd like to sing something of a different nature for you . 
person , if you please - the ' cradle_song '' ' . 
he sense rather_than hear the gasp that sweep across the audience . 
nor could he blame them . 
this particular song at this particular time could only be interpret as the ultimate in bad taste , callous exploitation beyond the bounds of decency . 
have no choice , he plunge into it , anyway , hold onto the microphone for support . 
`` lullaby_and_goodnight '' . 
voice shake . 
for_the_first_time in his life he forget the lyric midway through and had to cover_up by hum the rest . 
he wonder if the audience would let him finish . 
they did ; though contemptuous , they be still polite . 
but when he was finally through , their scorn was make apparent . 
someone clap tentatively then quickly stop . 
otherwise , the silence be complete . 
as the light come_up , person could see that a number of patron be already on their way toward the exit . 
he stumble offstage . 
`` my_god '' , he mutter . 
`` my_god '' . 
person be there to support him . 
`` it 's okay , location . 
the money 's here , all_of it '' . 
at this moment , all he could think_of be what he 'd been force to undergo . 
`` did you hear them ? 
do you know what they think_of me '' ? 
`` bunch of damn jerk '' , person growl . 
`` who needs them '' ? 
person pat his arm . 
`` sure , person , it 'll be all_right . 
nothing broken that can n't be mend '' . 
the words be hollow . 
person know , better than any of them , that a public image be as fragile as person . 
all the king 's horse and all the king 's man . 
location shoulder_in . 
`` i get_it , person . 
god_knows_how , but i get_it . 
you 'll never believe the place i 've be today . 
i practically had to sign your life away , you 'll probably fire me for some of the deal i had to go_for , but '' - 
person nod dully . 
`` it does n't matter , person . 
we 've do our part '' . 
he clutch that knowledge to him as he return to his dressing_room . 
the usual congratulatory crowd be conspicuously absent ; the place have the air of a morgue . 
person have no desire to linger himself but person report that the mob outside be still large despite the effort of the police to disperse them . 
now that he know himself to be self he be free to grok ever close to his brother , merge without let . 
self 's integrity be and be and ever had be . 
person stop to cherish all his brother self , the many threes-fulfilled on mars , corporate and discorporate , the precious few on earth - the unknown power of three on earth that would be his to merge with and cherish now that at_last long wait he grokked and cherish himself . 
person remain in trance ; there be much to grok , loose_end to puzzle_over and fit into his growing - all that he had see and hear and be at the location ( not just cusp when he and person had come face-to-face alone ) - why person make him warily uneasy , how person taste like a water_brother when she be not , the smell of goodness he had incompletely grokked in the jumping_up_and_down and wail - 
person 's conversation come and go - person 's word trouble him most ; he study them , compare them with what he had been teach as a nestling , struggle to bridge between language , the one he think with and the one he was learn to think in . 
the word `` church '' which turn_up over_and_over_again among person 's word give him knotty difficulty ; there be no martian concept to match it - unless one take `` church '' and `` worship '' and `` god '' and `` congregation '' and many other word and equate them to the totality of the only world he had know during growing wait & & & then force the concept back into english in_that phrase which had been reject ( by each differently ) by person , by person , by person . 
`` thou art god '' . 
he be close to understand it in english now , although it could never have the inevitability of the martian concept it stand_for . 
in his mind he speak simultaneously the english sentence and the martian word and feel close grokking . 
repeat it like a student tell himself that the jewel be in the lotus he sink into nirvana . 
before midnight he speed his heart , resume normal breathing , run_down his checklist , uncurl and sit_up . 
he had be weary ; now he feel light and gay and clearheaded , ready for the many action he see spread_out before him . 
he feel a puppyish need for company as strong as his earlier necessity for quiet . 
he step_out into the hall , be delight to encounter a water_brother . 
`` hi '' ! 
`` oh . 
hello , person . 
my , you look chipper '' . 
`` i feel fine ! 
where be everybody '' ? 
`` asleep . 
person and person go_home an hour ago and people start go_to_bed '' . 
`` oh '' . 
person feel disappoint that person had leave ; he want to explain his new grokking . 
`` i ought to be asleep , too , but i feel_like a snack . 
are you hungry '' ? 
`` sure , i'm hungry '' ! 
`` come_on , there be some cold chicken and we 'll see what else '' . 
they go downstairs , load a tray lavishly . 
`` let 's take it outside . 
it 's plenty warm '' . 
`` a fine idea '' , person agree . 
`` warm enough to swim - real indian_summer . 
i 'll switch_on the flood '' . 
`` do n't bother '' , person answer . 
`` i 'll carry the tray '' . 
he could see in almost total_darkness . 
person say that his night-sight probably come from the condition in which he had grow_up , and person grokked this be true but grokked that there be more to_it ; his foster_parent had teach him to see . 
as for the night be warm , he would have been comfortable naked on mount_everest but his water_brothers have little tolerance for change in temperature and pressure ; he be considerate of their weakness , once he learn of_it . 
but he was look_forward to snow - see for himself that each tiny crystal of the water of life be a unique individual , as he had read - walk barefoot , roll in it . 
in_the_meantime he be pleased with the warm night and the still more pleasing company of his water_brother . 
`` okay , take the tray . 
i 'll switch_on the underwater light . 
that 'll be plenty to eat by '' . 
`` fine '' . 
person like have light up through the ripple ; it be a goodness , beauty . 
they picnic by the pool , then lie back on the grass and look at star . 
`` person , there be mars . 
it be mars , is n't it ? 
or antares '' ? 
`` it be mars '' . 
`` person ? 
what are they do on mars '' ? 
he hesitate ; the question be too wide for the sparse english_language . 
`` on the side toward the horizon - the southern_hemisphere - it be spring ; plant are being teach to grow '' . 
`` ' teach to grow '' ' ? 
he hesitate . 
`` person teach plant to grow . 
i have help him . 
but my people - martian , i mean ; i now grok you be my people - teach plant another way . 
in the other hemisphere it is grow cold and nymph , those who stay alive through the summer , are being bring into nest for quickening and more growing '' . 
he think . 
`` of the human we leave at the equator , one has discorporated and the others be sad '' . 
yes , i hear it in the news `` . 
person had not hear it ; he had not know it until ask . 
`` they should not be sad . 
person first_class be not sad ; the person have cherish him '' . 
`` you know him '' ? 
`` yes . 
he have his own face , dark and beautiful . 
but he be homesick '' . 
`` oh , dear ! 
person & & & do you ever get homesick ? 
for mars '' ? 
`` at_first i be homesick '' , he answer . 
`` i be lonely always '' . 
he roll toward her and take her in his arm . 
`` but now i be not lonely . 
i grok i shall never be lonely again '' . 
`` mike darling '' - they kiss , and go_on kiss . 
presently his water_brother say breathlessly . 
`` oh , my ! 
that be almost worse than the first time '' . 
`` you be all_right , my brother '' ? 
`` yes . 
yes indeed . 
kiss me again '' . 
a long_time later , by cosmic clock , she say , `` person ? 
is that - i mean , ' do you know '' ' - 
`` i know . 
it be for grow close . 
now we grow close '' . 
`` well & & & i 've be ready a long_time - goodness , we all have , but & & & never_mind , dear ; turn just a_little . 
i 'll help '' . 
as they merge , grokking together , person say softly and triumphantly : `` thou art god '' . 
her answer be not in word . 
then , as their grokking make them ever close and person feel himself almost ready to discorporate her voice call him back : `` oh ! 
oh ! 
thou art god '' ! 
`` we grok god '' . 
on mars human were build pressure_dome for the male and female party that would arrive by next ship . 
this go fast than schedule as the martian be helpful . 
part of the time save was spend on a preliminary estimate for a long-distance plan to free bound oxygen in the sand of mars to make the planet more friendly to future human generation . 
the old_ones neither help nor hinder this plan ; time be not_yet . 
their meditation were approach a violent cusp that would shape martian art for many millennium .

group and location publish identical denunciation of person 's elevation , group and the group ignore it , group snicker at it , and the group simply report it - the fosterites in england be few but extremely militant . 
person be not pleased with his promotion . 
the person had interrupt him with his work half finished - and that stupid jackass person be certain to louse_up . 
person listen with angelic patience until person ran_down , then say , `` listen , junior , you be an angel now - so forget it .

get happy , junior '' ! 
person heave a deep ethereal sigh . 
`` okay , i'm happy . 
where do i start '' ? 
person did not hear of person 's disappearance when it was announce , and , when he did , while he have a fleeting suspicion , he dismiss it ; if person had had_a_finger_in it , he had gotten_away_with it - and what happen to supreme bishop worry person not at_all as_long_as he was n't bother . 
his household had go_through an upset . 
person deduce what had happen but did not know with whom - and did n't want to inquire . 
person be of legal_age and presumed able to defend himself in the clinch . 
anyhow , it be high_time the boy was salted . 
person could n't reconstruct the crime from the way the girl behave because pattern keep shift - abc vs d , then bcd vs a & & & or ab vs cd , or ad vs cb , through all way that four woman can gang_up on each other . 
this continue most of the week following that ill-starred trip to church , during which period person stay in his room and usually in a trance so deep that person would have pronounce him dead had he not see it before . 
person would not have mind it if service had not go_to_pieces .

absentminded , subject_to unexplained tears . 
person would have bet his life that if person were to witness the second_coming , she would memorize date , time , persona , event , and barometric_pressure without bat her calm blue eye . 
the expense and time involved be astronomical . 
however , we send a third vessel out , a much smaller and fast one than the first two . 
we have learn much about interstellar drive since a_hundred year ago ; that is all i can tell you about them . 
`` but the third ship come_back several year ago and report & & & '' . 
`` that it had find a planet on which human_being could live and which was already inhabit by sentient being '' ! say person , forget in his enthusiasm that he had not been ask to speak . 
person stop pace to stare at person with his pale blue eye . 
`` how did you know '' ? he say sharply . 
`` forgive me , person '' , say person . 
`` but it be inevitable ! 
did not the person predict in his time and the location that such a planet would be find ? 
i believe it be on page 573 '' ! 
person smile and say , `` i be glad that your scriptural lesson have leave such an impression '' . 
how could they not ? 
think person . 
besides , they be not the only impression . 
i still bear scar on my back where person , my gapt , whip me because i had not learn my lesson well enough . 
he be a good impresser , that person . 
was ? 
is ! 
as i grow old and was promote , so was he , always where i be . 
he be my gapt in the creche . 
he be the dormitory gapt when i go_to college and think i was get_away from him . 
he be now my block gapt . 
he be the one responsible_for my get such low m.r. 's . 
swiftly , come the revulsion , the protest . 
no , not he , for i , and i alone , be responsible_for whatever happen to me . 
if i get a low m._r. , i do so because i want it that way or my dark self does . 
if i die , i die because i willed it so . 
so , forgive me , person , for the contrary to reality thought ! 
`` please pardon me again , person '' , say person . 
`` but did the expedition find any record of the person having be on this planet ? 
perhaps , even , though this be too_much to wish , find the person himself '' ? 
`` no '' , say person . 
`` though that does not mean that there may not be such record there . 
the expedition be under order to make a swift survey of condition and_then to return to earth . 
i can n't tell you now the distance in light_year or what star this be , though you can see it with the naked eye at night in this hemisphere . 
if you volunteer , you will be tell where you 're go after the ship leave . 
and it leave very soon '' . 
`` you need a linguist '' ? say person . 
`` the ship be huge '' , say person , `` but the number of military_man and specialist we are take limit the linguist to one . 
we have consider several of your professional because they be lamechians and above suspicion . 
unfortunately & & & '' . 
person wait : person pace some more , frown . 
then , he say , `` unfortunately , only one lamechian linguist exist , and he be too old for this expedition . 
therefore & & & '' . 
`` a_thousand pardon '' , say person . 
`` but i have just think_of one thing . 
i be married '' . 
`` no problem at_all '' , say person . 
`` there will be no woman aboard the gabriel . 
and , if a man be married , he will automatically be give a divorce '' . 
person gasp , and he say , `` a divorce '' ? 
person raise his hand apologetically and say , `` you be horrified , of_course . 
but , from our reading of the western_talmud , we urielites believe that the person , know this situation would arise , make reference to and provision for divorce . 
it 's inevitable in_this case , for the couple will be separate for , at_the_least , forty year . 
naturally , he couch the provision in obscure language . 
in his great and glorious wisdom , he know that our enemy the israelites must not be able to read therein what we plan '' . 
`` i volunteer '' , say person . 
`` tell me more , person '' . 
six month later , person stand in the observation_dome of the gabriel and watch the ball of location dwindle above him . 
it be night on this hemisphere , but the light blaze from the megalopolis of australia , japan , china , location , india , siberia . 
person , the linguist , see the glittering disc and necklace in_terms_of the language speak therein . 
australia , the philippine_islands , japan , and northern china were inhabit by those member of the group that speak american . 
location , all_of southeast asia , southern india and ceylon , these state of the group speak bazaar . 
siberia speak icelandic . 
his mind turn the globe swiftly for him , and he visualize africa , which use swahili south of the location . 
all_around the location , asia_minor , northern india , and tibet , hebrew be the native tongue . 
in southern europe , between the israeli republic and the icelandic-speaking people of northern europe , be a thin but long stretch of territory called location . 
this be no_man's_land , dispute by the group and the group , a potential source of war for the last two hundred year . 
neither nation would give_up their claim on it , yet neither wish to make any move that might lead to a second apocalyptic_war . 
so , for all practical purpose , it be an independent nation and by now have its own organized government ( unrecognized outside its own border ) . 
its citizen speak all_of the world 's surviving tongue , plus a new one called lingo , a pidgin whose vocabulary was derive from the other six and whose syntax be so simple it could be contain on half a sheet_of_paper . 
person see in his mind the rest of earth : iceland , greenland , the caribbean_island , and the eastern half of south_america . 
here the people speak the tongue of iceland because that island had gotten_the_jump_on the hawaiian american who be busy resettle north_america and the western half of south_america after the apocalyptic_war . 
then there be north_america , where american be the native speech of all except the twenty descendant of french_canadian live on the location . 
person know that when that side of earth rotate into the night zone , location would blaze_out into space . 
and , somewhere in_that enormous light , be his apartment . 
but person would soon no_longer be live there , for she would be notify in a_few day that her husband had die in an accident while on a flight to location . 
she would weep in_private , he be sure , for she love him in her frigid way , though in_public she would be dry-eyed . 
her friend and professional associate would sympathize_with her , not because she had lose a beloved husband , but because she had be married to a man who think unrealistically . 
if person had been kill in a crash , he must have want it that way . 
there be no such thing as an `` accident '' . 
somehow , all the other passenger ( also supposed to have die in_this web of elaborate fraud to cover_up the disappearance of the personnel of the gabriel ) had simultaneously `` agree '' to die . 
and , therefore , be in disgrace , they would not be cremate and their ash fling to the wind in public ceremony . 
no , the fish could eat their body for all the group care . 
person feel sorry_for person ; he had_a_time keep the tears from well to his own eye as he stand in the crowd in the observation_dome . 
yet , he tell himself , this be the best way . 
he and person would no_longer have to tear and rend at each other ; their mutual torture would be over . 
person be free to marry again , not know that the group had secretly give her a divorce , think that death had dissolve her marriage . 
she would have a year in which to make_up_one's_mind her mind , to choose a mate from a list select by her gapt . 
perhaps , the psychological barrier that had prevent her from conceive person 's child would no_longer be present . 
perhaps . 
person doubt if this happy event would occur . 
person be as frozen below the navel as he . 
no_matter who the candidate for marriage select by the gapt . 
the gapt . 
person . 
he would no_longer have to see that fat face , hear that whining voice . 
`` person '' ! say the whining voice . 
and , slowly , feel himself icy yet burning , person turn . 
there be the squat loose-jowled man , smile lopsidedly up at him . 
`` my beloved ward , my perennial gadfly '' , say the whining voice . 
`` i have no idea that you , too , would be on this glorious voyage . 
but i might have know ! 
we seem to be bound by love ; person himself must have foresee it . 
love to you , my ward '' . 
`` person love you , too , my guardian '' , say person , choke . 
`` how wonderful to see your cherished self . 
i had think we would never again speak_to each other '' . 
the gabriel point towards her destination and , under one gee acceleration , begin to build_up towards her ultimate velocity , 99.1 percent of the speed_of_light . 
meanwhile , all the personnel except those few needed to carry_out the performance of the ship , go_into the suspensor . 
here they would lie in suspended_animation for many year . 
some time later , after a check had been make of all automatic equipment , the crew would join the others . 
they would sleep while the gabriel 's drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen body of the personnel could not have endure . 
upon reach the desired speed , the automatic equipment would cut_off the drive , and the silent but not empty vessel would hurl towards the star which be its journey 's end . 
many year later , the photon counting apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star be close enough to actuate deceleration . 
again , a force too strong for unfrozen body to endure would be apply . 
then , after slow the vessel considerably , the drive would adjust to a one gee deceleration . 
and the crew would be automatically bring_out of their suspended_animation . 
these member would then unthaw the rest of the personnel . 
and , in the half year left before reach their destination , the men would carry_out whatever preparation be needed . 
person be among the last to go_into the suspensor and among the first to come_out . 
he had to study the recording of the language of the chief nation of ozagen , siddo . 
and , from the first , he face a difficult task . 
the expedition that had discover ozagen had succeed in correlate two thousand siddo word with an equal number of american word . 
the description of the siddo syntax be very restricted . 
and , as person find_out , obviously mistaken in many case . 
this discovery cause person anxiety . 
his duty be to write a school_text and to teach the entire personnel of the gabriel how to speak ozagen . 
yet , if he use all_of the little means at his disposal , he would be instruct his student wrongly . 
moreover , even get_across this across would be difficult . 
for_one_thing , the organ of speech of the ozagen native differ somewhat from earthman 's ; the sound make by these organ be , therefore , dissimilar . 
it was true that they could be approximate , but would the ozagenians understand these approximation ? 
another obstacle be the grammatical construction of siddo . 
consider the tense_system . 
instead of inflect a verb or use an unattached particle to indicate the past or future , siddo use an entirely different word . 
thus , the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigalu'ahai , mean to live , be , in the perfect_tense , ksu'u'peli'afo , and , in the future , mai'teipa . 
the same use of an entirely different word apply for all the other tense . 
plus the fact that siddo not_only have the normal ( to earthman ) three gender of masculine , feminine , and neuter , but the two extra of inanimate and spiritual . 
fortunately , gender be inflected , though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not bear in siddo . 
the system of indicate gender vary according to tense . 
all the other part_of_speech : noun , pronoun , adjective , adverb , and conjunction operate under the same system as the verb . 
she was carry a quirt , and she start to raise it , then let it fall again and dangle from her wrist . 
`` i see your fire '' , she say , speak slowly , make an effort to control her anger . 
`` you could burn_down this whole mountainside with a fire that size . 
it would n't matter_to a fool like you . 
it would to me '' . 
`` all_right '' , person say quickly . 
`` the fire 's too big . 
and i appreciate the advice '' . 
he was lose patience again . 
an hour before , with the child asleep and nothing but the strange darkness , he would have appreciate company . 
she had help him change his mind . 
`` i'm not advise you '' , she say . 
`` i'm tell you . 
that fire 's too big . 
let it burn_down . 
and make_sure it 's out when you leave in the morning '' . 
he was take_aback . 
it take him a long_time to compose himself . 
`` there 's some mistake '' , he say finally . 
`` you 're right about the fire . 
it 's bigger than it has to be , though i do n't see where it 's do any harm . 
but you 're wrong about the rest of_it . 
i'm not leave in the morning . 
why should i ? 
i own the place '' . 
she show her surprise by tighten the rein and move_around the gelding around so that she could get a better look at his face . 
it did n't seem to tell her anything . 
she glance around the clearing , take_in the wagon and the load of supplies and trapping scattered over the ground , the two kid , the whiteface bull that was chew its cud just within the far reach of the firelight . 
she study it for a long_time . 
then she turn_back to person and smile , and he be n't quite sure what she mean by it . 
`` you own this place '' ? she say , and her tone had soften until it be almost friendly . 
`` you buy it '' ? 
`` from a man in st._louis '' , person say . 
`` person . 
maybe you know him '' . 
the girl laugh . 
`` i know him . 
i ought to . 
my father run_off him off here six year ago '' . 
person did n't say anything . 
he stand watch the girl , wonder what was come next . 
she had pick_up the quirt and was twirl it around her wrist and smile at him . 
`` person did n't tell you that '' , she say . 
`` no '' , person say . 
`` but it 's understandable . 
it 's not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of . 
and it does n't make any difference . 
he sell me a clear title . 
i have it with me , right here . 
if you want to see '' - 
`` never_mind '' , she say sternly . 
`` it would n't matter_to my father , and not to me . 
i mean what i say about that fire . 
be sure it 's out when you leave . 
that 's all . 
i 'll let you go_back to do the dish now '' . 
it was mean to insult him , and did n't quite succeed . 
he take the rein just below the bit and hold them firmly , and it was his turn to smile now . 
`` i do n't mind wash dish now_and_then '' , he say pleasantly . 
`` it does n't hurt . 
it might hurt you , though . 
somebody might mistake you for a woman '' . 
he mean to say more , but he never get the chance . 
she be quick . 
she bring_down the quirt down , slash it across his cheek , and he try to step back . 
she swing the quirt again , and this time he catch her wrist and pull her out of the saddle . 
she come_down against him , and he try to break her fall . 
he grab her by the shoulder and go_down on one knee , taking her weight so that some of the wind was drive out of him . 
it make him a_little sick , and he let_go_of her . 
he get_up slowly , and she be already on her feet , and he stand face her . 
he wipe the blood from his cheek . 
`` i ought to '' - he say . 
he was shake with anger , his breath come in long , painful gasp . 
`` that quirt - i ought to use it on you , where it would do the most good . 
if you be a man '' - 
`` she be n't , mister '' . 
the voice come from behind him , and person turn . 
the fire had go_down , and the man be only a shadow against the tree . 
but a moment later he bring_forward his horse forward into the light , and person have a good look at him . 
he be tall and dark-skinned , a half-breed , person think . 
and he be handsome , despite the long thin scar that slant across his cheek . 
`` she 's not a man , mister '' , he say . 
`` i be . 
if you 've got any idea '' . 
he raise the winchester and point it at person 's chest . 
`` put_down the rifle down , person '' , the girl say . 
she seem irritate . 
`` i think i tell you to stay home '' . 
the half-breed ease the winchester down and rest it across his lap . 
the scar look pure white in the half darkness ; his eye be black and deep-set , and expressionless . 
`` you should n't be ride up_here after dark , person '' , he say quietly . 
`` i can take_care of this . 
it 's no job for you '' . 
the girl tap the quirt impatiently against her knee and glare at him . 
he take it without flinch . 
`` i say go_home , person . 
you 've got no business up_here '' . 
the half-breed did n't answer this time . 
but the scar seem to pull hard at the corner of his mouth , and his eye be hurt and angry . 
it make person wonder . 
he watch the half-breed as he turn silently . 
they could hear the pony 's foot on the dry leaf for_a_while , then the sound fade_out . 
person brush the dust from his coat . 
`` who be that '' ? he ask . 
`` your personal guard ? 
you 're pretty hard on him '' . 
`` he work for my father '' , the girl say , and_then seem to change her mind . 
`` he 's a friend . 
his name 's person . 
is there anything else you want to know '' ? 
`` not now '' , person say . 
`` i guess i 'll find_out soon_enough . 
you 've got blood on your cheek . 
not yours . 
mine . 
it must have got there when you fall against me '' . 
she wipe_off it off with the sleeve of her coat . 
`` i 'll bet that 's as_close_as you 've be to a man since you be a baby '' , person say . 
he see her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt , and he grab her wrist . 
`` oh , no '' , he say , and he be without humor now . 
`` i 've have enough of_that . 
i 've have enough of you . 
i do n't know what go_on around here , and i do n't care . 
i do n't know what make you think you can get_away with this kind_of business , and i do n't care about that , either . 
you take me by surprise . 
but i 'll know how to handle you next time '' . 
she bring_up her free hand to hit him , but this time he be quicker . 
he sidestep her blow and she fall , stumble against the gelding . 
she finally regain her balance and get_up in the saddle . 
her hat had come_off and fall behind her shoulder , hold by the string , and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before . 
he had forget that she be so pretty . 
but her prettiness be what he had notice first , and all the other thing had come afterward : 
cruelty , meanness , self-will . 
he had know woman like that , one woman in_particular . 
and one had be too many . 
he watch the girl until she had go_into the tree , and wait until he could n't hear the sound of her horse any long , then go_up to where the child were sleep . 
they were n't sleep , of_course , but they think they were do him a favor by pretend . 
he had n't show_up too well in their eyes , let himself be browbeat by a woman . 
they expect greater thing from him , regardless of how trying the circumstance , and they be disappointed . 
and determined not to show it . 
they lie a_little too stiffly , with their eye strain to stay closed . 
`` go_to_sleep '' , he say . 
`` both of you . 
there 's better thing to do than listen to something like that . 
i 'll be down at the creek finish the dish , if you want me '' . 
he find the pan where he had drop it and carry it back down to the stream . 
the coyote was call again , and he hope that this time there would be no other sound to interrupt it . 
not tonight , at_any_rate . 
he have a feeling that the girl mean trouble . 
if she did , he could stand it better in the light . 
he scrub absentmindedly at the pan and reflect on how thing had turn_out . 
that afternoon when they had pull_up in_front_of the broken-down ranch_house , his hope had be high . 
already some of the pain had go from person 's death . 
not all_of it . 
there would still be plenty of moment of regret and sadness and guilty relief . 
but they were start a new life . 
and they have almost everything they needed : land , a house , two whiteface bull , three horse . 
the land be n't all person had expect of_it . 
six hundred and forty acres , the old_man back in st._louis had say ; good grass , good water . 
well , the grass be there , though in some place the ground be too steep for a cow to get to it . 
the water be there , so much of_it that it spread all_through the dead orchard . 
and there was a house ; livable perhaps , but badly in_need_of repair . 
in_the_last_analysis , though , person have little cause to complain . 
the place had be cheap - just the little he have left after person 's burial - and it would serve its purpose . 
there be only one place where person 's description had go badly awry : the peace and quiet . 
it had n't start_out that way . 
and he have a feeling - thanks to the girl - that thing would get worse before they get better . 
they had the house clean_up by noon , and person send the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horse . 
he stand on the porch and watch him struggle with the heavy harness , and finally go over to help him . 
person be already in the wagon . 
they were go_to town , and they be both excited . 
person back the team into the trace , and wish they were n't go_to town at_all . 
he have an uneasy feeling about it . 
that girl last night , what be her name ? 
person . 
it be the only thing about her that be the_least_bit hard to remember . 
he finish with the team and fill his pipe and stand look about him . 
he had spend two hour ride around the ranch that morning , and in broad daylight it be even less inviting than person had make it seem . 
there be brush , and stand of pine that no grass could grow under , and place so steep that cattle would n't stop to graze . 
but there be water . 
there be an artificial_lake just out_of_sight in the first stand of tree , feed by a half dozen spring that pop_out of the ground above the hillside orchard . 
yes , there be plenty of water , too_much , and that be probably the trouble . 
there be track of cattle all_over his six hundred and forty acres . 
the first part of the road be steep , but it level_off after the second bend and curl gradually into the valley . 
it be hot once they reach the flat , and dry , but the grass be better . 
a warm breeze play across it , move it like wave . 
a red-tailed_hawk fly in behind them and stay there , watch for any snake or rabbit that they might stir_up from the side of the road . 
it take them an hour before they come to the first house of location . 
the town be about what person expect : one main_street with its row of false-fronted building , a water_tower , a_few warehouse , a single hotel ; all dusty and sunbaked . 
the place be quiet . 
they neither like nor dislike the old_man . 
to them he could have be the broken bell in the church_tower which ring before and after mass , and at noon , and at six each evening - its tone , repetitive , monotonous , never break the boredom of the street . 
the old_man be unimportant . 
yet if he be not there , they would have miss him , as they would have miss the sound of bee buzz against the screen_door in early june ; or the smell of thick tomato_paste - the ripe smell that be both sweet and sour - rise_up from aluminum tray wrapped in fly dotted cheesecloth . 
or the surging whirling sound of bat at night , when their black body dive into the blackness above and below the amber streetlight . 
or the bay of female dog in heat . 
they never call him by name , although he have one . 
person , that 's what he be called in the old_country ; but here he be just signore or the old_man . 
but this be not unusual , because youth in these quarter was always push at a distance from its elder . 
youth obey when command . 
it go_to church on sunday and one saturday a month go_to confession . 
but youth ask nothing of its parent - not a touch of the hand or a kiss give in_passing . 
the only thing unusual about the old_man had long_since happen . 
but the past be dead here as the present be dead . 
once the old_man had have a wife . 
and once she , too , ignore him . 
with a tiny fur-piece wrapped around her shoulder , she wiggle her satin covered buttocks down the street before him and did n't stop . 
in one hand she clutch a hundred_dollar_bill and in the other a straw suitcase . 
the way she strut down the street , the old_man would have be blind not to have notice both . 
without look at him , without look at anything except location directly in_front of her , she climb_up into one of those orange streetcar , ride_away in it , and never come_back . 
`` but she should n't have come here in_the_first_place '' , the woman had say . 
`` no , no . 
not that one . 
she think she be big than we be because she come from location '' . 
`` eh , location ! 
she give herself fancy airs ! 
just because she have a part on_the_stage in the old_country , she think she could carry her head high than ours '' . 
they had slap their thigh . 
`` it 's not for make pretty speech about dante those actress get pay so good '' . 
`` henh '' ! 
calloused finger , caress only by the smoothness of polished rosary , had sway excitedly beneath puckered chin where tiny black hair sprout , never to be tweeze away . 
mauve colored mouth that had never know anything sweet than the taste of new wine and the passion of man 's tongue had not smile , but had condemn again_and_again . 
`` puttana '' ! 
but if the old_man even think_about his wife now , nobody cared_a_fig . 
it was enough for people to know that at_one_time he had look down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman he had consume - watch her become thin and thin in the distance , as thin as the seam on her stocking , and still thin . 
his voice had not command her to stop . 
it had not question why . 
the woman say they had see him wave an exhausted farewell ; but he might have been shoo_away the flea that hop from his yellow dog onto him . 
( he be never without that dog . ) 
and his eye - those miniature sundial of variegated yellow - had not alter their expression or direction . 
the old_man 's very soul could have leave him and fly down that street , but he would n't have had anyone know it . 
perhaps he had know then where that hundred_dollar_bill had come from and where it was take his wife . 
but when he call_for his withered , wrinkled sister person to care for him and the child , had he guess that all he would remember of his woman be the memory of her climb into that streetcar ? 
there seem to be a contemptuous purpose in the way he sit there with his eye glue to location and his back in_opposition to the church behind him . 
for all he see or care to see , this could have been a town in italy , not the outskirts of philadelphia . 
it could have been location or location for the way it smell . 
what did it matter_to him that the park at the foot of location stretch beneath elevated train that roar from the stucco station into the city 's center at half-hour interval ? 
or that the tiny creek spin its silent course toward the location ? 
this place be hatred to him , just as hatred be his only companion in his aloneness . 
to him they be one_and_the_same . 
sameness for the old_man was frame_in by a wall of ginkgo tree which divide these quarter from the city . 
sameness line the street with two story house the color of ash . 
it slash the sloping manure scented lawn with concrete steps which climb upward to white wooden porch . 
it sway with the wicker swing and screech with the rusted hinge of screen_door . 
even the stable garage , which house nothing now but the scent of rot , have a lawn before it . 
and the coffee_shop on location , where the man spend their evening and sunday play card , have a rose hedge beneath its window . 
the hedge reek of coffee dregs throw against it . 
only one house on the street have no lawn before it . 
it squat low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron grating support a glass facade . 
that be person 's shop . 
above it , from a second story showroom , wooden angel survey the neighborhood . 
did the old_man remember them there ? 
yet everywhere else sameness be stucco and wood in square_block - like fortress perch against the slant of the hill , rise with the hill to the top where the church be and beyond that to the cemetery . 
only paved alleyway tunnel through the wall of those fortress into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the house where backyard own no fence , where one man 's property blend with the next to form courtyard in which no one know privacy . 
love and hatred and fear be one here , shaded only by fig_tree and grapevine . 
and the forked tongue of gossip lick its sinister way from back_porch to back_porch . 
the old_man silently feed_upon these street . 
they keep him alive , wait . 
wait for what and for whom , only he could tell and would not . 
it was as though he had make a pact with the devil himself , but it be not_yet time to pay the price . 
he was hold_out for something . 
he was determined to hold_out . 
the old_man 's son throw himself down , belly first , upon a concrete step , take_in the coolness of it , and dream of the day he would be rich . 
at fifteen he did n't care that he have no mother , that he could n't remember her face or her touch ; neither did he care that person provide for him . 
he was name person as a tribute to his heritage , and he could n't have care less about that either . 
to him life be a restless boredom that begin with the rising sun and end only with sleep . 
when he would be a man , he would be a rich_man . 
he would not be like the `` rich american '' who live in white columned house on the other side of the park . 
he would not ride the eight-thirty local to the city each morning . 
he would not carry a briefcase . 
nor would he work at_all . 
he would square his shoulder and carry a cane before each step . 
he would sit inside the coffee_shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come run , bow with her running , call_out in her bow , `` at your service '' . 
he would order her to bring coffee , and would take from his vest_pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff - he would not remove his gloves - and light and smoke . 
he could do that when he would be a man . 
`` hey , person '' ! he call to his sister on the porch above the steps . 
she be only ten month older than he . 
`` person , what would you say if i smoke a pipe '' ? 
person did not answer him . 
she lean unconcerned against the broken porch fence , brush and dry her wet , gilded hair in the sun . 
one lithe leg straddle the railing and swing loosely before the creaking , torn pale . 
her tanned foot , whose arch sweep high and white , point artfully toward tapering toe - toe like finger , whose tip glow white . 
all the while she sit there , her sinewy arm swirl before her chest . 
her face show no sign of having hear person . 
it be a face that had lose its childlike softness and was begin to fold within its fragile feature a harshness that belie the lyric line of its contour . 
the eye , blue and always somewhat downcast , possess a sullen quality . 
even_though the boy could not see them , he know they were cloud by distance . 
he be never sure they fully take_in him in . 
person call again , `` person '' ! 
but the only answer that reach him be the screech of the porch rail from her leg move against it . 
`` she 's in_a_mood '' , he think `` there 's not a month she does n't get herself in_a_mood '' . 
well , what did that matter when the sun was shine and there be dream to dream about ? 
and as for his pipe , if he want to smoke one , nobody would stop him . 
not even person . 
suddenly he was interrupt in his daydream by a warm wetness lap against his chin , and his eye open wide and long at the sight of a goat 's claret tongue , feast against the salt taste of him . 
above the tongue , an aged yellow eye , sallow and time-cast , encrust within a sphere of marbleized pink skin , stare unfalteringly at him . 
`` christ_sake , goat , git '' ! 
but the goat would not . 
`` you 're boil milk , ai n't you '' ? soothe it with his hand , know the whiskered jowl and the swollen smoothness of teat that wrinkle expectantly to his touch . 
person roll_over . 
his head undulate gradually , cover space , to come strain beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teat . 
with his mouth open wide , he squirt the warm white milk against the roof_of_the_mouth of his mouth and his tongue savor the light , earthy taste of it . 
the boy 's finger and mouth operate with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player , press and pull , delight in what he do . 
above him slide the evasive shadow of a storm_cloud . 
its form be a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane . 
but the boy could see only the goat 's belly . 
the old_man near the corner let the shadow pass_over him , sense something portentous in it . 
he know it be there , know also what it be about , but he would n't raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog 's back . 
there would be time enough , perhaps the old_man reassure himself , to pay the devil his due . 
time enough to give_up his soul . 
in_the_meantime , six sandal , stained an ocher , the same color as person 's shaved hair , edge_up close to him . 
the clapping they make on the concrete interrupt him in the ecstatic pleasure he know , so that he quickly release his hold on the goat and pretend to be examine its haunch for tick . 
he know at a glance that the biggest sandal belong to person , the neat ones to person , and the laced ones to person , person 's idiot brother . 
person expect person 's small body to sink close and close to the ground . 
he expect person 's thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy , and her shrill , impetuous voice to sound against the rotundity of his disfigured flesh that be never sure of hear anything . 
nothing in english has been ridicule as_much_as the ambiguous use of word , unless it be the ambiguous use of sentence . 
person say , `` clearly speak , person . 
you explain english by greek '' . 
person say , `` i think the interpreter be the hard to be understand of the two '' . 
and a witty american journalist remark over a century ago what be even more true today , `` many_a writer seem to think he be never profound except when he can n't understand his own meaning '' . 
there be many type of ambiguity and many_of them have been describe by rhetorician under such name as amphibology , parisology , and other ology . 
in common parlance they would be describe as miss - misinterpreters , misunderstanders , misdirectors and kindred misdeed . 
one species of ambiguity try to baffle by interweave repetition . 
`` did you or did you not say what i say you say , because person say you never say what i say '' ? 
another woman , address christmas_card , say to her husband : `` we send them one last year but they did n't send us one , so they probably won't send us one this year because they 'll think we won't send them one because they did n't last year , do n't you think , or shall we '' ? 
such ambiguous exercise compound confusion by make it worse compound , and they are sometimes expand until the cream of the jest sour . 
ambiguity of a non repetitious kind describe the dilemma one girl find herself in . 
`` i'm terribly upset '' , she tell a girlfriend . 
`` i write person in my last letter to forget that i had tell him that i did n't mean to reconsider my decision not to change my mind - and he seem to have misunderstand me '' . 
evidently person be another of those man who simply do n't understand woman . 
another case involve a newspaper reporter who trip_up a politician . 
`` person , you may recall that we print last week your denial of having retract the contradiction of your original statement . 
now would you care to have us say that you were misquote in regard_to it '' ? 
question like this , frame in verbal fog , be perhaps the only kind that have ever stump an experienced politician . 
they recall person 's classic comment : `` i wish he would explain his explanation '' . 
similarly , when a reporter once question person in cryptic fashion , person refuse to make any further statement . 
`` i fear explanation explanatory of thing explain '' , he say , leave the biter bit - and bitter . 
the obscurity of politician may_not always be as innocent as it look . 
`` senator '' , say an interviewer , `` your constituent can n't understand from your speech last night just how you stand on the question '' . 
`` good '' ! 
reply the senator . 
`` it take me five hour to write it that way '' . 
the misplaced modifier be another species more honored in the observance of obscurity than in the breach . 
this create an amusing effect because its position in a sentence seem to make it apply to the wrong word . 
a verse familiar to all grammarian be the quatrain : 
`` i see a man once beat his wife when on a drunken spree . 
now can you tell me who be drunk - the man , his wife , or me '' ? 
the `` wooden_leg '' gag of vaudeville , another standby of this sort , have endless variation . 
`` '' there 's a man outside with a wooden_leg named person `` . 
'' what 's the name of his other leg `` '' ? 
another stock vaudeville gag run : `` mother be home sick in bed with the doctor '' . 
when radio come_in , it continue the misplaced modifier in its routine as a standard device . 
`` '' do you see that pretty girl stand next to the car with slacks on `` ? 
'' i see the girl but i do n't see the car with slacks on `` '' . 
in recent year gagwriter have discover this brand of blunder and thus the misplaced modifier has acquire a new habitat in the gag_line . 
in one cartoon a family is show outside a theater with the head of the family address the doorman : `` excuse me , but when we come_out we find that we had leave my daughter 's handbag and my wife 's behind '' . 
journalism supply us with an endless run of such slip . 
not long_ago a newspaper advise those take_part in a contest that `` snapshot must be of a person not larger than * * f inch '' . 
classified ad be also chockful of misrelated construction . 
reader of the reader_'s_digest be familiar_with such item which often appear in its list of verbal slip , like the ad in a california paper that advertise `` house for rent . 
view take_in five county , two bedroom '' . 
since brevity be the soul of ambiguity as_well as wit , newspaper headline continually provide us with amusing sample . 
`` official meet on rubbish . 
many shape in bathtub . 
son and daughter of local couple marry '' . 
apart from misplaced modifier and headlinese , journalism contribute a wide variety of comic ambiguity in both editorial and advertising matter . 
a weekly newspaper report a local romance : `` and the couple were marry last saturday , thus end a friendship which begin in their schooldays '' . 
an item in the letter column of a newspaper renew a subscription , add : `` i personally enjoy your newspaper as_much_as my husband '' . 
then there be the caterer 's ad which read : `` are you get_married or have an affair ? 
we have complete facility to accommodate 200 people '' . 
the newspaper too be the favorite habitat of the anatomical . 
this slip be so-called because its semi ambiguous english always seem to refer to a person 's anatomy but never quite mean what it seem to say . 
sample : 
he walk in upon her invitation . 
she kiss him passionately upon his reappearance . 
he kiss her back . 
not without good reason has the anatomical be called jocular journalese . 
in news item a man is less often shoot in the body or head than in the suburb . 
`` while person was escort person from the church social last saturday night , a savage dog attack them and bite person on the public_square '' . 
such item recall the california journalist who report an accident involve a movie_star : `` the area in which person - was injure be spectacularly scenic '' . 
the double meaning in the anatomical make it a familiar vaudeville device , as in the gag of person and person . 
when a witness at court was ask if he had been kick in the ensue rumpus , he reply , `` no , it be in the stomach '' . 
strangely_enough , this always brought_the_house_down . 
apart from journalese and vaudeville gag , the anatomical is also find in jocular literature . 
a conscientious girl become the secretary of a doctor . 
her first day at work she was puzzle by an entry in the doctor 's note on an emergency case . 
it read : `` shoot in the lumbar region '' . 
after a moment of thought , her mind clear and , in the interest of clarity , she type into the record : `` shoot in the woods '' . 
there be many grammatical misconstruction other_than dangling_modifier and anatomical which permit two different interpretation . 
at the home of a gourmet the new maid was instruct in the fine point of serve . 
`` i want the fish serve whole , with head and tail '' , the epicure explain , `` and serve it with lemon in mouth '' . 
the maid demur . 
`` that 's silly - lemon in mouth '' , she say . 
but since the gourmet insist that it is do that way at_the_most fashionable dinner , the girl reluctantly agree . 
so she bring the fish in whole , and she carry a lemon in her mouth . 
another specimen of such double_entendre is illustrate by a woman in a department_store . 
she say to the saleslady , `` i want a dress to put_on around the house '' . 
the puzzled saleslady inquire , `` how large be your house , madam '' ? 
this saleslady be a failure in the dress department and was transfer to the shoe department . 
when a customer ask for alligator shoe , she say , `` what size be your alligator '' ? 
the comic indefinite comprise an extensive class of comedy . 
one species is restrict to statement which be neither explicit nor precise regard a particular person , place , time or thing . 
a woman meet a famous author at a literary tea . 
`` oh , i'm so delight to meet you '' , she gush . 
`` it be only the other day that i see something of yours , about something or other , in some magazine '' . 
this baffling lack of distinct detail recall the secretary whose employer was leave the office and tell her what to answer if anyone call in his absence . 
`` i may be back '' , he explain , `` and then_again , i may_not '' . 
the girl nod understandingly . 
`` yes , sir '' , she say , `` is that definite '' ? 
an old-fashioned mother say to her modern daughter , `` you must have get_in quite late last night , dear . 
where be you '' ? 
the daughter reply , `` oh , i have dinner with - well , you do n't know him but he 's awfully nice - and we go_to a_couple_of place - i do n't suppose you 've hear of them - and we finish_up at a cute little nightclub - i forget the name of it . 
why , it 's all_right , be n't it , mother '' ? 
her woolly minded parent agree . 
`` of_course , dear '' , she say . 
`` it 's only that i like to know where you go '' . 
no less ambiguous be the indefinity of a certain clergyman 's sermon . 
`` dearly beloved '' , he preach , `` unless you repent of your sin in a measure , and become convert to a degree , you will , i regret to say , be damned to a more_or_less extent '' . 
this clergyman should have refer to person 's dictum : `` so-so be a good , very good , very excellent maxim . 
and yet it be not . 
it be but so-so '' . 
indefinite reference also carry double meaning where an allusion to one person or thing seem to refer to another . 
a news item describe the launching of a ship : `` complete the ceremony , the beautiful movie_star smash a bottle of champagne over her stern as she slide gracefully down the ways into the sea '' . 
this be not unlike the order receive by the sergeant of an army motor_pool : `` four truck to location gym , 7 : 30 tonight , for haul girl to dance . 
the body must be clean and seat wipe_off '' . 
a politician was approach by a man seek the office of a minor public official who had just die . 
`` what be my chance for take person 's place '' ? he ask . 
`` if you can fix_up it up with the undertaker '' , return the politician , `` it 's all_right with me '' . 
the manager of a movie_theater receive a telephone_call from a woman who be equally indefinite . 
`` what have you got_on today '' ? she inquire . 
`` a blue suit '' , he answer . 
`` who 's in it '' ? she continue . 
`` i be '' , he say . 
there be a short pause for reflection . 
`` oh '' , say the woman , `` i 've see that picture already '' . 
another brand of indefinite reference arise out of the use of the double verb . 
when a question contain two verb , the response does not make clear which of them is being answer . 
the moonlit night was make_for romance , and he had been look at her soulfully for some time . 
finally he ask , `` do you object to petting '' ? 
`` that 's one thing i 've never do '' , she say promptly . 
he think a moment , then inquire , `` you mean pet '' ? 
`` no '' , she smile , `` object '' . 
reply to request for character reference be notorious for their evasive double_entendre . 
it would be hard to find anything more equivocal than : `` i cannot recommend him too highly '' . 
another less ambiguous case read as_follows : `` the bearer of_this letter has serve me for two year to his complete satisfaction . 
if you are think_of give him a berth , be sure to make it a wide one '' . 
in the comedy of indefinite reference , it wit occupy a prominent place because of its frequent occurrence . 
ambiguity arise when the pronoun it carry a twofold reference . 
two friend were talk . 
one say , `` when i get a cold i buy a bottle of whiskey for it , and within a_few hour it 's gone '' . 
the speaker refer to the whiskey but his friend think he mean the cold . 
it wit be a misnomer because it cover slip as_well as wit . 
an excited woman was make an emergency call over the phone : `` doctor , please come over right_away . 
my husband be in great pain . 
i call the other afternoon on my old friend , person , the anglo-american literary critic - his mother be_born in ohio - who live alone in a fairytale cottage on the location , raise_hell and peacock , the former only when the venerable gentleman become an angry old_man about the state of literature or something else that is dwindle and diminish , such_as human stature , hope , and humor . 
my unscientific friend does not believe that human stature be measurable in_terms_of speed , momentum , weightlessness , or distance from earth , but be a matter of the development of the human mind . 
after person become the great man in the world , for a nation that does not believe_in the cult_of_personality or in careerism , person write me a letter in which he say : `` i am not interest in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly . 
a bee 's place be in the hive '' . 
`` i have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy '' , i tell him , at which he start slightly , and_then make us each a stiff drink , with a trembling hand . 
`` i seem to remember '' , he say , `` that in an interview ten year ago you give humor and comedy five year to live . 
did you go_to their funeral '' ? 
`` i be wrong '' , i admit . 
`` comedy did n't die , it just go crazy . 
it has identify itself with the very tension and terror it once did so much to alleviate . 
we now have not_only what has been call over here the comedy of menace but we also have horror joke , magazine known as horror_comics , and sick comedian . 
there are even publication called group and mad . 
the person be not crazy as a loon or mad as a march hare ; it be manic as a man '' . 
`` i wake_up this morning '' , person say , `` paraphrase person . 
do you want to hear the paraphrase '' ? 
`` can i bear it '' ? 
i ask , take a final gulp of my drink , and hand him the empty glass . 
`` just barely '' , he say , and repeat his paraphrase : 
`` the time has come '' , the walrus say , `` to speak of manic thing , of shot and shout , and seal doom of commoner and king '' . 
person fix us each another drink , and say , `` for god 's sake , tell me something truly amusing '' . 
`` i 'll try '' , i say , and sit for a moment think . 
`` oh yes , the other day i reread some of person 's english_traits , and there be an anecdote about a group of english and american visit germany , more_than a_hundred year ago . 
in the railway_station at berlin , a uniformed attendant was chant , ' foreigner this way ! 
foreigner this way ' ! 
one woman - she could have be either english or american - go_up to him and say , ' but you be the foreigner '' ' . 
i take_a_breath a deep breath and an even deep swallow of my drink , and say , `` i admit that go back to person for humor be like go_to a modern musical_comedy for music and comedy '' . 
`` what 's the_matter with the music '' ? 
person ask . 
`` it does n't drown_out the dialogue '' , i explain . 
`` let 's talk_about book '' , person say . 
`` i am tell that in america you have non book by non writer , bring_out by non publisher for non reader . 
is it all nonfiction '' ? 
`` there be nonfiction and non nonfiction '' , i say . 
`` speak of nonism : the other day , in a story about a sit-down demonstration , the paris_herald_tribune write , ' the non violence become noisy ' . 
and_then person was quote as say , in non english , that person 's plan to exterminate the jew be nonsense '' . 
`` if we cannot tell evil , horror , and insanity from nonsense , what be the future of humor and comedy '' ? 
person ask , grimly . 
`` cryptic '' , i say . 
`` they require , for existence , a brave spirit and a high heart , and where do you find these ? 
in our present era of science and angst , the heart has been downgrade , to use one of our popular retrogressive verb '' . 
`` i know what you mean '' , person sigh . 
`` last year your person tell our person , in a television_program , that it is the task of the playwright to throw light into the dark corner of the human heart . 
like almost everybody else , he confuse the heart , both as organ and as symbol , with the disturbed psyche , the deranged gland , and the jumpy central_nervous_system . 
i'm not plead for the heart that leap up when it behold a rainbow in the sky , or for the heart that with rapture fill and dance with the daffodil . 
the sentimental pure heart of person is go with the knightly year , but i still believe_in the heart of the person character that was not make of the stuff that break '' . 
`` we no_longer have person 's and person 's ' heart for any fate ' , either '' , i say . 
`` person and person did n't have the fate that face us '' , person say . 
`` one day our species promise coexistence , and the next day it threaten co_extinction '' . 
we sit for_a_while drink in silence . 
`` the heart '' , i say finally , `` be now either in the throat or the mouth or the stomach or the shoe . 
when it was wear in the breast , or even on the sleeve , we at_least know where it be '' . 
there be a long silence . 
`` you have visit england five time in the past quarter-century , i believe '' , my host say . 
`` what has impress you most on your present visit '' ? 
`` i would say depress , not impress '' , i tell him . 
`` i should say it be the turning of court of law into veritable theatre for sex drama , involve clergyman and parishioner , psychiatrist and patient . 
it is become hard and hard to tell law court and political_arena from the modern theatre '' . 
`` do you think we need a new person to re-explore the anglo-american scene '' ? he ask . 
`` or perhaps a new person '' ? 
`` but you must have hear it say that the drawing_room disappear forever with the somnolent year of person and the antic heyday of person . 
i myself hear it say constantly - in drawing_room . 
in them , there be usually a group of anglo-american with tragicomic problem , worthy of being explore either in the novel or in the play or in comedy and satire '' . 
i stand_up and begin pace . 
`` if you are try to get_out us out of the brothel , the dustbin , the kitchen_sink , and the tawdry living_room , you are probably waste your time '' , person tell me . 
`` too many of our writer seem to be interest only in creature that crawl out of the woodwork or from under the rock '' . 
`` furious and furious '' , i say . 
`` i am worry about the current meaning of the word ' funny ' . 
it now mean ominous , as when one speak of a funny sound in the motor ; disturbing , as when one say that a friend is act funny ; and frightening , as when a wife tell the police that it is funny , but her husband has n't be home for two day and night '' . 
person sit brood for a full minute , during which i make each of us a new drink . 
he take his glass , clink it against mine , and say , `` toujours gai , what_the_hell '' ! borrow a line from person ' mehitabel . 
`` be careful of the word ' gay ' , for it , too , has undergo a change . 
it now mean , in my country , homosexual '' , i say . 
`` oh , i forget to say that if one is take to the funny_house in the funny_wagon , he is remove to a mental_institution in an ambulance . 
recently , by_the_way , i receive a questionnaire in which i was ask whether or not i was non institutionalized '' . 
my host go_over and stare out the window at his peacock ; then he turn_to me . 
`` is it true that you believe the other animal be sane than the human species '' ? 
`` oh , that is demonstrable '' , i tell him . 
`` do you remember the woman in the location who be all alone with her sheep one day when the sun darken ominously ? 
she tell the sheep , ' the world is come to an end ' ! 
and the sheep say - all in_unison , i have no_doubt - ' ba-a-a ' ! 
the sound mockery of sheep be like the salubrious horselaugh '' . 
`` that is only partly non nonsense '' , he begin . 
`` if you see the drama called rhinoceros '' , i say , `` think_of the effect it would have on an audience of rhino when the actor on stage suddenly begin turn_into a rhinoceros . 
the rhino would panic , scream ' help ' ! 
- if that can be scream in their language '' . 
`` you think the russian are get_ahead of us in comedy '' ? 
person demand . 
`` non-god , no '' , i say . 
`` the political and intellectual left begin fight humor and comedy year ago , because they fear thing they do not understand and cannot manage , such_as satire and irony , such_as humor and comedy . 
nevertheless , like any other human_being upon whom the spotlight of the world play continually , person , the anti personality cultist , has become a comic actor , or think he has . 
in his famous meeting with person a_couple_of year ago he seem to believe that he be as funny as person . 
but , like caesar , he have only one joke , so_far_as i can find_out . 
it consist_in say , ' that would be send the goat to look_after the cabbage ' . 
why in the name_of_his_non-god does n't he vary it a_bit '' ? 
`` such_as '' ? 
person ask . 
`` such_as ' send the cat to guard the mouse ' , or ' the falcon to protect the dove ' , or most terribly sharp of all , ' the human_being to save humanity '' ' . 
`` you and i have fall out of literature into politics '' , person observe . 
`` what a nasty fall was there '' ! 
i say . 
person go over to stare at his peacock again , and_then come_back and sit_down , restively . 
`` the world that be once footloose and fancy-free '' , he say , `` has now become screw-loose and frenzy free . 
in our age of science and angst it seem to me more brave to stay on earth and explore inner man than to fly far from the sphere of our sorrow and explore outer_space '' . 
`` the human ego be what it be '' , i put_in , `` science_fiction has always assume that the creature on the planet of a_thousand larger solar_system than ours must look_like gigantic tube-nosed_fruit_bat . 
it seem to me that the first human_being to reach one of these planet may well learn what it is to be a truly great and noble species '' . 
`` now we are leave humor and comedy behind again '' , person protest . 
`` not in the largest sense of the word '' , i say . 
`` the other day person speak against the inveterate tendency of our species to believe_in the uniqueness of its religion , its ideology , and its virtually everything else . 
why do we not realize that no ideology believe so much in itself as it disbelieve in something else ? 
forty year ago an english writer , person , deal with this subject in eddies_of_the_day , and say , as an example , that ' person for location ' would not start a spirit half so quickly as ' strike frog eat frenchman dead '' ' ! 
`` there be also gott_strafe_angleterre '' , person remind me , `` and carthago_delenda_est , or if you will , deus_strafe_carthage . 
it is n't what the ideologist believe_in , but what he hate , that put the world in jeopardy . 
this be the force , in our time and in every other time , that urge the paranoiac and the manic-depressive to become head of a state . 
complete power not_only corrupt but it also attract the mad . 
there be a bitter satire for a future writer in that '' . 
`` great satire has always been clearly write and readily understandable '' , i say . 
`` but we now find writer obsessed by the nooks_and_crannies of their ivory_tower , and curiously devoted to the growing obscurity and complexity of poetry and non poetry . 
i write a_few year ago that one of the cardinal rule of writing be that the reader should be able to get some idea of what the story be about . 
one day , the child had want to get_up onto person 's horse . 
they want to see what his back feel like - the person 's . 
he look so comfortable be straight . 
they want to touch the mystery . 
person was boost_up them up when the policeman come_by . 
he be very rude . 
person have a hard voice , too , this time . 
the policeman 's eye rather pop for a second ; but then person get another tone in a hurry , and she say , `` if it was n't for these dear child '' - . 
the policeman get a confused , funny look on his face , and he had answer kind_of politely , `` now , look_here , lady : i know you got to entertain these kid and all . 
but this be a public park and it 's a city ordinance that the statue cannot be crawl on '' . 
person be so ashamed that she hang her head when she say , `` yes , sir '' . 
the policeman walk on , but he look_back once . 
that had happen on the day when two other unusual thing had occur . 
person had teach them a new way to have fun in their little private area ; and they had tell their mother about the tumble . 
in matter of exact information , that keep her one step behind development ; and so they be consistently true to their principle . 
`` never_mind_'' , person had say , after the policeman had leave , having pursue the usual uncooperative course of grownup . 
`` never_mind . 
i know something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn '' . 
`` what be it '' ? ask the child , whose reflex and reply be invariably so admirably normal and predictable . 
maybe that be why they be cordial and loyal towards the unpredictability of person . 
`` just you wait '' , advise person , echo the dialogue in a recent british movie . 
and when they had get to their little lawn , they had have a most twirlingly magnificent time . 
first , person had put them through some rapid somersault . 
they had protest that that be n't any surprise . 
`` just you wait '' , say person again , as though she were discover the pleasantly tingling insinuation of that handy little sturdy statement . 
`` this be a warm-up '' . 
`` is it anything like cooked-over oatmeal '' ? ask one of the child . 
`` not the_least_bit '' , person snap . 
one of the many thing that be so nice about her be that she always take your question seriously , particularly your very , very serious question . 
those be especially the ones that all other grownup laugh_at loud . 
she would sometimes even get a_little hard on you , she take you so seriously . 
but not hard for very long . 
just long enough to make you feel important . 
`` now '' , say person , eventually , make them both sit in formation on a big root of a live_oak , the sort of root that divide itself and make their bottom sag_down and feel comfortable . 
`` now , we 're going_to be like what person and his horse make us think_of '' . 
the child look at each other and sag their bottom down even more comfortably than ever . 
their curiosity go happily out-of-bounds . 
then , person throw herself backwards and wiggle in a way that be just wonderful . 
she hold herself that way and turn her head towards them and laugh and wink . 
`` imagine be able to laugh and wink when you 're like the top part of that picture_frame at home '' , one of them say . 
they both laugh and wink back . 
`` i'm person 's horse , upside_down '' , person say , sort_of gaspingly , for her : even she had to breathe kind_of funny when she be in that position . 
she make person 's horse 's belly do so funny when it be upside_down . 
then , she be back on her foot , wink and smile that enormous smile ( she have lots of wonderful big tooth that you never would have suspect she have when she was not smile ) . 
and she would wink and throw kiss . 
they both try to keep smile and wink for a long_time , but it make their lip and eyelid tremble . 
but they keep_on clap for a long , long time . 
`` this time '' , person say , and she even keep_on wiggle a_bit little bit while she was just talk , `` you 're going_to tell me what i be and what i'm do . 
it all have something to do with person and his horse '' . 
this time , it be so grand ; they could tell exactly what it be . 
it be person 's horse run in a circle . 
his leg shake , and the shaking go right on up his body through his hip to his shoulder . 
`` that be the general 's horse '' , one of them cry_out . 
the other remark , in a happy laughter , `` that be a funny old horse '' . 
the first one say , `` he sure does shake . 
he be old '' . 
then there be the general kiss his wife . 
they had to be tell that one . 
but it be even funny after they had been tell . 
their father , when he come_back from those many business trip , just bump their mother on the forehead with his lip and ask if anybody had think to mix the martini and put them in the electric icebox . 
but not person . 
he be the funny man . 
he never could keep still , even when he did n't move his foot . 
then , they had to get_up and be person . 
or his horse . 
all they could think_of was to run_around in circle , kick their leg out . 
it be n't very funny . 
then , they say person was going_to jump over his horse 's head ; and they do some somersault . 
but that be n't very funny , either . 
`` you ought to shake '' , person advise them . 
and person show them how to begin . 
she also teach them to sing `` i wish i could shimmy like my sister person '' . 
that help a_lot . 
they be clumsy , but they were begin to catch_on . 
they also catch_on a_bit little bit on how to smile a_lot without your lip tremble . 
`` imagine you won't get your allowance if you 're catch not smile - or smile with your lip tremble too_much '' , person suggest . 
that help a_great_deal . 
they be a_little late in get home . 
`` i'm sorry , person '' , person say in a tone so low you could hardly hear it . 
my mother constitute herself the voice of all_of us . 
`` it be perfectly understandable , person '' , my mother say in a friendly way . 
`` i suppose you all were play and forget '' ? 
`` yes , ma'am '' , the child chorus heartily . 
we could n't help laugh . 
the child rush_off to get_rid_of their sweater ; and person begin tap the kitchen door open . 
`` person be a good girl '' , my uncle remark to us ; but he say it too_soon , for it come_out just before the tap to which the door respond . 
that tap have a slight bang ish quality . 
`` she really be a dear little thing '' , my mother agree . 
her upper lip lift slightly . 
she was bite into a small red radish ; and that action always cause her to lift her lip from the sting of the thing . 
also , she live in continual fear of find a white worm curled_up in a neat , mean little heap at the white center of the radish . 
she would try to see over the bulge of her cheek and somewhat under her tooth to the place where she was bite . 
it never work , naturally ; but it make her look unusual . 
also , when she had bite_off half of the small radish , she find the suspense unbearable ; and she would snatch the finger hold_out half of the radish out to where she could inspect it . 
one could hear a very faint , ladylike sigh of relief . 
actually , it be inaudible to anyone not expect it . 
but the warm joy of her brown eye be open to the general public . 
later_on , the child tell her further about somersaulting . 
`` it must be awfully good for them . 
and awfully kind of person '' , she tell us later . 
`` but do you know something curious '' ? she add . 
`` i reach_into that funny little pocket that is high_up on my dress . 
i have no notion why i reach . 
and i find a radish . 
was it an omen ? 
i think for a second . 
but i would not pamper myself in that silly way . 
i open the window and throw_out the radish out '' . 
then , my mother blush at this small lie ; for she know and we know that it be cowardice that had make one more radish that night just too impossible a strain . 
person become indispensable ; nobody could have tell why . 
but she be . 
it be in_the_air . 
a friend of my father 's come to dinner . 
he was pass_through town and phone to say hello . 
as a result , he was persuade out to dinner . 
as_a_matter_of_fact , this happen every four or five month . 
sometimes , he coincide with my father 's be at home . 
sometimes , as at this juncture , he did not . 
but he was always persuade out . 
he like child , in a loathsome kind of way ; the two young in our family always had to be bring_in and put_through trick for his entertainment . 
when he had leave , i could never remember whether he had poke them in their middle , laughingly , with a thick index_finger or whether he be merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assume the action , not bother to look . 
the child loathe him , too . 
this_evening , they were push in from the breakfast room , with odds_and_ends of dessert distribute over them . 
there had be some coconut in it , for i remember my mother 's taking a quick glance at a stringy bit of this nut on the cheek of one of them and_then put_down her radish with a shiver . 
they were push gently into the room by person - whose only part appear be hand that creep quickly back around to the kitchen side of the door . 
we had just sit_down . 
`` tell person what you 're do these day '' , my mother advise the child , ceremonially . 
there was an air of revolt about the child - even irreverence for their own principle . 
this could be tell chiefly from a sort of head toss and prance , a horse like balkiness of demeanor . 
possibly , the coconut contain dessert had bring_up bitter problem of administration . 
but , at the beginning , this stay just in_the_air . 
`` we go_to the park with this nice lady '' , one of them say . 
`` we have good time '' . 
this happy bulletin convulse person . 
`` you do '' ? he ask , between wheeze of laughter . 
he was force to wipe his eye . 
`` you do n't step on the flower , do you ? 
eh '' ? 
one of the child maneuver out of range of the poke index_finger . 
`` no '' , he say . 
`` we do n't '' . 
person take a swig of his sherry . 
he was so long think that my mother have time to inspect her sherry for dregs . 
usually , this was do when attention was divert by someone else 's long , boring story . 
but this time she be nervous : she be open . 
person be finally in command of his mind again . 
`` tell me - what do you do at the park '' ? he ask . 
this was deliver in a forthright way , without coyness and over pretended interest - an admirable way with child . 
only , unfortunately , he could not remove from his voice a nagging insinuation of the direct command . 
this nettle the child into the revelation of exact truth , a sacrifice of their secret superiority over grown people , but a victory in the wide field of perpetration and illegitimate accomplishment . 
`` we bump '' , one say ; and the other go_on to development of the idea . 
`` we grind , too '' , he say . 
my mother be beside_herself with curiosity . 
`` say that again '' , she plead . 
she laugh a_little and toss the dregs rakishly around in her glass . 
`` you what '' ? 
she could see that person was intrigue ; the hostess in her take_over . 
she be rollickingly happy . 
`` you what '' ? 
my uncle look at person . 
he read person and used_to pretend profundity through eye-beaming at people . 
person look down . 
he would not look up . 
he be very funny about the whole_thing . 
person , a delightful vignette set in the unforgettable epoch of pre punic_war rome . 
person , the hero , is beset from all side by the problem of approach manhood . 
the story open on the eve of his fifty-third birthday , as he prepare_for the two_weeks of festivity that be to follow . 
suddenly , a messenger arrive and , just before collapse dead at his foot , inform him that the saracen have invade location , the home province of his affianced . 
he at_once cancel the celebration and , buckle on his scimitar , stumble blindly from the house , where he is hit and kill by a passing oxcart . 
the group 's presentation of person 's immortal il_sevigli_del_spegititgninino , with guest contralto person . 
an unusual , if not extraordinary , rendering of the classic myth that involve the rescue of prometheus from the rock by the group was give last week in the warehouse of the group amid cheer of `` hubba hubba '' and `` yalagaloo pip pip '' ! 
after a `` busy '' overture , the curtain rise on a farm scene - the location in northern maine . 
a dead armadillo , the sole occupant of the stage , symbolize the crisis and destruction of the old_order . 
old_order , act and atonally sing by person , the lovely serbantian import , then enter and deliver the well-known invocation to the god person , whereupon the stage is quite unexpectedly visit by a company of wandering location priest , symbolize love , lust , prudence and group , respectively . 
according to the myth , old_order then vanish at stage_left and reappear at extreme stage_right , but director person skillfully sidestep the rather gooshey problem of stage_effect by simply having person walk across the stage . 
the night we see it , a rather unpleasant situation arise when the soloist refuse to approach the armadillo , complain - in ad_lib - that `` it smell '' . 
we catch the early train to new_york . 
the dharma_dictionary , a list of highly unusual term use in connection with eurasian proto-senility cult . 
it 's somewhat off_the_beaten_track , to_be_sure , but therein lie its variety and charm . 
for_example , probably very few people know that the word `` visrhanik '' that is banter about so much today stem from the verb `` bouanahsha '' : to salivate . 
likewise , and equally fascinating , be the news that such unlikely synonym as `` pratakku '' , `` sweathruna '' , and the tongue_twister `` nnuolapertar-it-vuh-karti-biri-pitknoumen '' all originate_in the same village in location and are all use to express sentiment concern british `` imperialism '' . 
the term be fairly safe to use on this side of the ocean , but before you start spout them to your date , it might be best to find_out if he be a member of person 's group , since resentment toward the native be reportedly very high in_that outfit . 
the_breeze_and_chancellor_neitzbohr , a movie melodrama that concern the attempt of a west german politician to woo a plaster_cast of the person . 
as you have doubtless guess already , the plot is plaster with freudian , jungian , and meinckian theory . 
for_example , when the film be only four minute old , person refer to a small , victorian piano_stool as `` person '' , and we are thereupon subject to a flashback that inform us that this very piano_stool was once use by an epileptic governess whose name , of_course , be person ( the english equivalent , when pass_through middle gaelic derivation , of person ) . 
for the remainder of the movie , person proceed to lash the piano_stool with a slat from a venetian_blind that used to hang in the prewar location . 
in this manner , he seek to expunge from his own soul the guilt_pang cause by his personal assault against the_english at location . 
as we find_out at the end , it is not the stool ( symbolize person , therefore the_english ) that he is punish but the piece of venetian_blind . 
and , when the slat finally shatter , we see him count the fragment , all the while mutter , `` he love me , he love me not '' . 
after a_few tortuous moment of wonder who `` he '' be , the movie_camera pan across the room to the plaster statue , and we realize that person is try to redeem himself in_the_eyes_of a mute piece of sculpture . 
the effect , needless to say , be almost terrifying , and though at_times a_bit obscure , the film be certainly a much needed catharsis for the `` repressed '' moviegoer . 
the music of bini_salfininistas , capital_lp 63711 - r , one of the rare recording of this titanic , yet unsung , composer . 
those person who be lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the brest-silevniov_festival in august , 1916 , will certainly welcome his return to public notice ; and it be not unlikely that , even as the great person lie_dormant for so many year , so has the erudite , ingenious person pass_through his `` purgatory '' of neglect . 
but now , under the guidance of the contemporary composer person person , a major revival be underway . 
as he lead the group , person give a tremendously inspired performance of both the person and person concerto , include the controversial person cadenza , which was include at the conductor 's insistence . 
a major portion of the credit should also go to flautist person for his render of the almost impossible `` indianapolis '' movement in the person . 
not_only be person 's intonation and phrasing without flaw , but he seem to take every tonal eccentricity in_stride . 
for_example , to move ( as the score require ) from the low f major register up_to a barely audible n minor in four second , not skip , at_the_same_time , even one of the 407 fingering , seem a feat too absurd to consider , and it be to the flautist 's credit that he remain silent throughout the passage . 
we would have prefer , however , to have had the rest of the orchestra refrain_from laugh at this and other spot on the recording , since it mar an otherwise sober , if not lofty , performance . 
as broadway itself become increasingly weight_down by trite , heavy-handed , commercially successful musical and inspirational problem drama , the american theatre is go_through an inexorable renaissance in_that nebulous area known_as `` off-broadway '' . 
for the last two year , this frontier of the arts has produce a number of so-called `` non drama '' which have leave indelible , bittersweet impression on the psyche of_this veteran theatregoer . 
the latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of_this theatrical vine be the , an adaptation of person 's classic frog haiku by person , a former group chemistry instructor . 
although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there be eleven act vary in length from twenty-five second to an hour and a half ) , the statement it make concern the ceaseless yearning and search of youth be profound and worthy of our attention . 
the action center about a group of outspoken and offbeat student sit around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee . 
they are relentlessly rebuff on all side by a waitress , the police , and an intrude government tutor . 
the innocence that they try to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroy forever when one of them , ask for a piece of lemon_meringue_pie , get a plate of english_muffin instead . 
leave the theatre after the performance , i have a flash of intuition that life , after_all ( as person say ) , be just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee , and that this unpretentious , moving , clever , bitter slice of life be the greatest thing to happen to the american theatre since person retire . 
age but still precocious , french feline enfant_terrible person has succeed in shock jaded old paris again , this time with a sexy ballet scenario called the_lascivious_interlude , the story of a nymphomaniac triphammer operator who fall_in_love hopelessly in_love with a middle-aged steam_shovel . 
a biting , pithy parable of the all pervading hollowness of modern life , the piece has been set by person to a sumptuous score ( a single motif play over_and_over by four thousand french_horn ) by existentialist hotshot person . 
petite , lovely person play the nymphomaniac engagingly . 
ever since bambi , and , more recently , born_free , there have be a_lot of book about animal , but few compare with person 's wry , understate , charming , and immensely readable my_friend_, the quizzical_salamander . 
do in the modern style of a `` confession '' , person tell in exquisite detail how he came to know , and , more important , love his mother 's pet salamander , person . 
it be not an entirely happy book , as person soon become jealous of person and , in retaliation , refuse to continue to scrape the algae off her glass . 
person , in a fit of despair , take person and run_off for two marvelous week in location ( person call it `` the most wonderful and lovely fourteen day in my whole life '' ) , at the end of which person tragically contract parkinson's_disease and die . 
this brief resume hardly do_justice the book justice , but i heartily recommend it to all those who be engage with the major problem of our time . 
opera in the grand_tradition , along with mah-jongg , seem to be stage a well deserved comeback . 
in this country , the two guiding_light be , without_doubt , person and person . 
person , a lean , chiseled , impeccable gentleman of the old_school who was once mistake on the street for person , be responsible_for the rediscovery of person 's earliest , most raucous opera , nabisco , a sumptuous bout-de-souffle with a haunting leitmotiv that strike me as be highly reminiscent_of the person version of `` volare '' . 
person have a voice that person once describe as `` like chip tooth with a screwdriver '' , and her round , opalescent face become fascinatingly reflective of the emotion demand by the role of person . 
the location is literally litter this summer with the prostrate body of france 's beat-up beatnik jeunes_filles . 
cause of all this commotion : squat , pug-nosed , balding , hopelessly ugly person , a bogartian figure , who play a sadistic , amoral , philosophic group salesman in old new_waver person 's endlessly provocative film , a_sour_sponge . 
person has been alternately describe as `` a symbol of the new grandeur of france and myself '' ( person ) and `` a decadent , disgusting slob '' ! 
( person ) , but no one can deny that the screen crackle with electricity whenever he be on it . 
soar to stardom along with him , person , a luscious and curvaceously beguiling italian starlet , turn_in a creditable performance as an airplane mechanic . 
the battle of the drib-drool continue , but most of new_york 's knowing sophisticate of abstract_expressionism are stamp their foot impatiently in expectation of v ( for vindication ) day , september first , when person 's first one-man show open at the location . 
we have hear that after see person 's work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity and importance of the whole abstract movement . 
and it is think by many who think_about such thing that person be the logical culmination of a school that start with person , progress through person and the cubist picasso , and blossom just recently in person and person . 
person define his own art as `` the search for what be not there '' . 
`` i paint the nothing '' , he say once to person and myself , `` the nothing that_is behind the something , the inexpressible , unpaintable ' tick ' in the unconscious , the ' spirit ' of the moment rest forever , suspend like a huge balloon , in non time '' . 
it is his relentlessness and unwavering adherence to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enable him to paint such picture as `` the_invasion_of_cuba '' . 
in this work , his use of non color be startling and skillful . 
the sweep of space , the delicate counterbalance of the white mass , the overall completeness and unity , the originality and imagination , all entitle it to be call an authentic masterpiece . 
i ask person recently how he accomplish this , and he reply that he had paint his model `` a beautiful shade of red and_then have her breathe on the canvas '' , which be his typical tongue-in-cheek way of chide me for my lack of sensitivity . 
dear sirs : let me begin by clear_up any possible misconception in your mind , wherever you be . 
the collective by which i address you in the title above be neither patronizing nor jocose but an exact industrial term in_use among professional thief . 
it be , i am reliably give to understand , the technical argot for those who engage in your particular branch of the boost ; i.e. , burglar who rob while the tenant be absent , in contrast to hot slough prowler , those who work while the occupant be home . 
since the latter obviously require an audacity you do not possess , you may perhaps suppose that i am taunt you as socially inferior . 
far from it ; i merely draw an etymological distinction , hope that specialist and busy people like you will welcome such precision in a layman . 
above_all , disabuse yourselves of any thought that i propose to vent moral indignation at your rifle my residence , to whimper over the loss of a_few objet_d'art , or to shame you into rectitude . 
my object , rather , is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the grave implication for you , far beyond the legal sanction society might inflict . 
you have unwittingly set_in_motion force so malign , so vindictive , that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them . 
quite candidly , fellow , i would n't be_in_your_shoes for all the rice in china . 
as you 've doubtless forget the circumstance in the press of more recent depredation , permit me to recapitulate them briefly . 
sometime on saturday evening , august 22nd , while my family and i were dine at the group , in rome , you jimmy a window of our home in location , pennsylvania , and let yourselves into the premises . 
hasten to the attic , the temperature of_which be easily hot than the location , you proceed to mask the window with a fancy wool coverlet , some khaki pants , and the_like , and to ransack the innumerable box and barrel store there . 
what you were look_for ( unless you make a hobby of collect old tennis_racket and fly screen ) elude me , but to judge from phonograph_record scatter about a fumed_oak victrola , you dance two tango and a paso_doble , which must have been fairly enervate in that milieu . 
you then descend one story , glom a television_set from the music room - the only constructive feature of your visit , by_the_way - and , return to the ground_floor , enter the master_bedroom . 
from the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureau beneath , you abstract seventeen ivory , metal , wood , and stone sculpture of oriental and african origin , two snuffbox , and a jade handled magnifying_glass . 
rummage through a stack of drawer nearby , you unearth an antique french chess_set in ivory and sandalwood , which , along with two box_kodak , you add to your haul . 
then , having wrap the lot in an afghan my dog customarily sleep on , you lam out the front_door , considerately leave it open for neighbor to discover . 
so_much_for the tiresome fact , as familiar to you , i'm sure , as to the constable and state trooper who follow in your wake . 
the foregoing , aid by several clue i 'll withhold to keep you on_your_toes , will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of person , but before they close_in , gird yourselves , i repeat , for a vengeance infinitely more pitiless . 
fourteen of the sculpture you take possess property of a most curious and terrifying nature , as you will observe when your limb begin to wither and your hair fall_out in patch . 
in_time , these minor manifestation will multiply and effloresce , riddle you with frambesia , the king's_evil , sheep_rot , and clonic spasm , until your very existence become a burden and you cry_out_for release . 
all this , though , be simply a prelude , a curtain_raiser , for what ensue , and i doubt whether any occidental could accurately forecast it . 
if , however , it would help to intensify your anguish , i can delimit the power of a_few of the divinity you 've affront and describe the punishment they meted_out in one analogous instance . 
hold_on tight . 
first_of_all , the six figure of the buddha you heist - four siamese head , a black obsidian statuette in the earth touch position , and a large brass figure of the dying_buddha on a teakwood base . 
now , you probably share the widespread western belief that the person be the most compassionate of the god , much more so than person and person and the rest . 
' fess up - do n't you ? 
well , ordinarily he be , except ( as the wheel_of_the_law specify ) toward impious folk who steal , disturb , or maltreat the presence . 
very peculiar retribution indeed seem to overtake such joker . 
eight or ten year ago , a_couple_of french hood steal a priceless khmer head from the group , in paris , and a week later crawl into the group with unmistakable symptom of leprosy . 
hell 's own amount of chaulmoogra_oil do nothing to alleviate their torment ; they expire amid indescribable fantods , implore the person to forgive their desecration . 
any reputable french interne can supply you with a dozen similar instance , and i 'll presently recount a case out of my own personal experience , but , for_the_moment , let 's resume our catalogue . 
whether the pair of sudanese ivory carving you lift really possess the juju to turn your liver to lead , as a dealer in khartoum assure me , i be not competent to say . 
likewise the ivory chinese female figure known as a `` doctor lady '' ( provenance location ) ; a friend of mine remove her from the curio cabinet for inspection was fell as if by a hammer , but he had previously drink a quantity of applejack . 
the three indian brass deity , though - person , person , and person - be an altogether different cup_of_tea . 
they hail from location , a state in the subcontinent where person , the goddess of death , is worship . 
have you ever hear of thuggee ? 
nuf sed . 
but it be the wooden sculpture from bali , the one represent two man with their head bend backward and their body interlace by a fish , that i particularly call to your attention . 
oddly_enough , this be an amulet against housebreaker , present to the mem and me by a local rajah in 1949 . 
inscribe around its base be a charm in balinese , a dialect i take it you do n't comprehend . 
neither do i , but the person be good enough to translate , and i 'll do as much for you . 
whosoever violate our rooftree , the legend state , can expect maximal sorrow . 
the tooth will rain from his mouth like pebble , his wife will make him cocu with fishmonger , and a trolley_car will grow in his stomach . 
furthermore - and this , to me , strike an especially warming note - it shall avail the vandal naught to throw_away or dispose of their loot . 
the cycle of disaster start the moment they touch any belongings of ours , and dog them unto the forty-fifth generation . 
sort_of remorseless , is n't it ? 
still , there it be . 
now , you no_doubt regard the preceding as pap ; you 're tool_around full of gage in your hot_rod , gorge yourselves on pizza and play pinball in the tavern and generally behave like ubermensch . 
in that case , listen to what befall another wisenheimer who tangle_with our joss . 
a_couple_of year back , i occupy a location apartment whose outer staircase contain the type of niche called a `` coffin turn '' . 
in it be a stone tibetan buddha i had pick_up in bombay , and occasionally , to make merit , my wife and i garland it with flower or lay a_few penny in its lap . 
after a while , we become aware that the money was disappear as fast as we replenish it . 
our suspicion eventually center_on , by the process of elimination , on a grocer 's boy , a thoroughly bad_hat , who deliver carton to the people overhead . 
the more i probe into this young_man 's activity and character , the less savory i find him . 
i learn , for_example , that he make a practice of yap at dog he encounter and , in winter , of sprinkle salt on the icy pavement to scarify their foot . 
his energy be prodigious ; sometimes he would be up before dawn , clad as a garbage_collector and hurl pail into areaway to exasperate us , and thereafter would hurry to the group to grimace at the lion and press cigar_butt against their paw . 
evening , he was frequently to be see at restaurant like person + person or group drunkenly don lady ' hat and sing `` o_sole_mio '' . 
in_short , and to borrow an arboreal phrase , slash_timber . 
well , the odious little toad go_along chivy animal and human who could n't retaliate , and in_due_course , as be inevitable , overreach himself . 
one morning , we discover not_only that the penny be miss from the idol but that a cigarette had been stub_out in its lap . 
`` now he 's buy_it '' , say my wife contentedly . 
`` no divinity will hold_still_for that . 
he 's really ask for it '' . 
and how right she be . 
the next time we see him , he be a changed person ; he had age thirty year , and his face , the color of tallow , was crisscrossed with wrinkle , as though it had been wrap in chicken wire . 
some sort_of nemesis was haunt his footstep , he tell us in a quavering voice - either an ape specter or person , a process-server , we could n't determine which . 
his eye have the same dreadful rigid stare as person 's when he was find before his open safe wear the speckled band . 
the grocery the youth work for soon tired_of his depressing effect on customer , most of whom be sufficiently neurotic without the threat of incubus , and let him go . 
the beautiful , the satisfying part of his disintegration , however , be the masterly way the buddha polish_off him off . 
reduced to beggary , he at_last get a job as office_boy to a television producer . 
his hubris , deficiency of taste , and sadism carry him straightaway to the top . 
he evolve program that plumb new depth of bathos and besmirch whole network , and quickly supersede his boss . 
not long_ago , i ride down with him in an elevator in group ; he was talk to himself thirteen to the dozen and smoke two cigar at_once , clearly a man in_extremis . 
`` see that guy '' ? the operator ask pityingly . 
`` i would n't be_in_his_shoes for all the rice in china . 
there 's some kind_of a nemesis haunt his footstep '' . 
however one look_at it , therefore , i 'd say that your horoscope for this autumn be the reverse of rosy . 
the inventory you acquire from me is n't going_to be easy to move ; you can't very well sidle up to people on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot person . 
additionally , since you 're going_to be hors_de_combat pretty soon with sprue , yaws , delhi_boil , the granville_wilt , liver_fluke , bilharziasis , and a host of other complication of the hex you 've arouse , you must n't expect to be lionize socially . 
my advice , if you live long enough to continue your vocation , be that the next time you 're attract by the exotic , pass_up it up - it 's nothing but a headache . 
as you can count_on me to do the same . 
compassionately yours , 
person . 
the door of the d train slide shut , and as i drop into a seat and , exhale , look up across the aisle , the whole aviary in my head burst into song . 
she be a living doll and no mistake - the blue-black bang , the wide cheekbone , olive flushed , that betray the cherokee strain in her midwestern lineage , and the mouth whose only fault , in the novelist 's carping phrase , be that the lower lip be a_trifle too voluptuous . 
from what i be able to gauge in a swift , greedy glance , the figure inside the coral colored boucle dress be stupefying . 
your invitation to write_about person to honor his 70th anniversary for the april issue of sovietskaya_muzyka is accept with pleasure , because i admire the music of person ; and with sober purpose , because the development of person personify , in many way , the course of music in the union_of_soviet_socialist_republics . 
the person whom we know in the united_states_of_america be gay , witty , mercurial , full of prank and bonheur - and very capable as a professional musician . 
these quality endear him to both the musician and the social economic haute monde which support the concert world of the post world_war_i , era . 
person 's outlook as a composer pianist conductor in america be , indeed , brilliant . 
person 's classical_symphony was hail as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well trained musician still in his twenties . 
to the traditionalist , it be a brilliant satire on modernism ; to the neo classicist , it be a challenge to the prewar world . 
what be it to person ? 
a tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th century idea ; a trial_balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times ; a brilliant piece_de_resistance ? 
certainly its composer be an ascending star on a new world horizon . 
i hear the classical_symphony for_the_first_time when person conduct it in paris in 1927 . 
all musical paris be there . 
some musician be enthusiastic , some skeptical . 
i myself be one of the skeptic ( 35 year ago ) . 
i remember person in the foyer , shout in his high-pitched voice : `` it may be a tour_de_force , mais_mon_dieu , can anyone take this music seriously '' ? 
the answer be , `` yes '' ! 
certainly , america take person and his classical_symphony seriously , and with a good_deal of pleasure . 
his lifelong friend , person , give unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performance in boston , new_york , and washington , dc , to_which he add broadcasting and recording for the whole nation . 
chicago be also a welcome host : there , in 1921 , person conduct the world_premiere of the love_for_three_oranges , and play the first performance of his third_piano_concerto . 
`` uncle_sam '' be , indeed , a rich uncle to person , in those opulent , postwar victory year of peace and prosperity , bold speculation and extravaganza , enjoyment and pleasure : `` the golden_twenties '' . 
we attend the premiere of his concerto , symphony , and suite ; we study , teach , and perform his piano_sonata , chamber_music , gavotte , and march ; we buy his record and play them in our school and university . 
we unanimously agree that person had win his right as a world citizen to the first rank of twentieth century composer . 
nevertheless , person was much influence by paris during the twenties : the paris which be the artistic center of the western world - the social paris to which russian aristocracy migrate - the chic paris which attract the tourist dollar of rich america - the avant-garde paris of person , stravinsky , person , person , picasso - the laissez-faire paris of dadaism and ultramodern art - the paris sympathique which take young composer to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasm . 
so young person be the darling of success : 
in his motherland ; in the spacious hunting_ground of `` uncle_sam '' ; in the exciting salon of his lovely , brilliant paris - mistress of gaiety - excess and abandon - world theatre of new found freedom in tone , color , dance , design , and thought . 
meanwhile , three great terrible force were coagulate and crystallize . 
in this worldwide conscription of men , mind , and machine , person was recall to his native_land . 
the world explode when fascism challenge all concept of peace and liberty , and the outraged , freedom love people of the capitalist and socialist world combine force to stamp fascist tyranny into cringing submission . 
after this holocaust , a changing world occupy the mind of man ; a world beset with new boundary , new treaty and government , new goal and method , and the age-old fear of aggression and subjugation - hunger and exposure . 
in this changed world , person settle to find himself , and to create for large national purpose . 
here , this happy , rove son of good_fortune prove that he could accept the discipline of a new social economic order fight for its very existence and ideal in a truculent world . 
here , person become a workman in the vineyard of socialism - produce music for the masses . 
it is at this point in his life that the mature person emerge . 
one might have expect that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroy the creative flair of a composer , especially one whose work be so fluent and spontaneous . 
but no : person grow . 
he accept the environment of his destiny - take_root and grow to fulfill the stature of his early promise . 
by 1937 he had clarify his intention to serve his people : `` i have strive for clarity and melodious idiom , but at_the_same_time i have by_no_means attempt to restrict myself to the accepted method of harmony and melody . 
this be precisely what make lucid , straightforward music so difficult to compose - the clarity must be new , not old '' . 
how right he be ; how clearly he see the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism . 
and with what resource did person back_up his credo of words - with torrent of powerful music . 
compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between his neat and witty little classical_symphony and his big , muscular , passionate , and eloquent fifth_symphony ; or the love_for_three_oranges ( gay as it be ) with the wonderful , imaginative , colorful , and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet , the stone_flower . 
this masterpiece have gaiety , too , but it be the gaiety of dancing people : earthy , salty and humorous . 
of_course , these work be not comparable , even though the same brain conceive them . 
the early work were conceive for a sophisticated , international audience ; the late work were conceive to affirm a way_of_life for fellow citizen . 
however , in all of person 's music , young or mature , we find his profile - his `` signature '' - his craftsman 's attitude . 
person never forsake his medium for the cause of experimentation per_se . 
in orchestration , he stretch the limit of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color . 
his sense for rhythmic variety and timing be impeccable . 
his creative development of melodic design of slavic dance tune and love song be captivating : witty , clever , adroit , and subtle . 
his counterpoint be pertinent , skillful , and rarely thick . 
also , it should be note that the polytonal freedom of his melody and harmonic modulation , the brilliant orchestration , the adroitness for evade the heaviness of figured_bass , the skill in florid counterpoint be not lost in his mature output , even in the spectacular historical drama of the stage and cinema , where a large , dramatic canvas of sound be required . 
that person 's harmony and form sometimes seem professionally routine to our ear , may or may not indicate that he be less of an `` original '' than we prefer to believe . 
need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability . 
person might well emerge as a cultural hero , who , by the force of his creative life , help preserve the main stream of tradition , to which the surviving idiom of current experimentalism may be eventually add and integrate . 
at this date , it seem probable that the name of person will appear in the archives of history , as an effective traditionalist , who be fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation , and use it as it serve his purpose ; yet be never caught_up in it - never a slave to its academic dialectic . 
certainly , it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endear him to the western world - not his experimentation . 
so person be able to cultivate his musical talent and harvest a rich reward from them . 
nor can anyone be certain that person would have do better , or even as well , under different circumstance . 
his fellow countryman , person stravinsky , certainly do not . 
why did person expand in stature and fecundity , while stravinsky ( who leap into fame like a young giant ) dwindle in stature and fruitfulness ? 
i think the answer is to be find in person 's own words : 
`` the clarity must be new , not old '' . 
when person forge his new clarity of `` lucid , straightforward music , so difficult to compose '' , he shape his talent to his purpose . 
when stravinsky shape his purpose to the shifting scene of many culture , many salon , many dialectic , many personality , he try to refashion himself into a stylist of many style , determine by many disparate culture . 
person was guide in a consistent direction by the life of his own people - by the compass of their national idea . 
but person was sway by the attitude of whatever culture he was reflect . 
in all his miscalculation , person make the fatal historical blunder of presume that he could transform other composer ' inspiration - represent many people , time_period and style - into his own music by warp the harmony , melody , or form , to verify his own experiment . 
because of the authentic homogeneity of his early nationalistic material , and his flair for orchestration - his brilliant petruchka , his savage sacre_du_printemps , his incisive les_noces - the world keep hope that he could recapture the historical direction for which his native talent be predisposed . 
but time is run_out , and many_of stravinsky 's admirer begin to fear that he will never find terra_firma . 
his various aesthetic postulate remain as landmark of a_house_divided_against_itself : supra_expressionism , neo paganism , neoclassicism , neoromanticism , neo_jazz , neo ecclesiasticism , neo popularism , and most_recently , post serialism - all compete with each other within one composer ! 
what a patchwork of proclamation and renunciation ! 
meager and shabby by-product linger to haunt our memory of a once mighty protagonist ; a maladroit reharmonization of our national_anthem ( the star-spangled_banner ) ; a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto ; a circus polka for elephant ; his hope that the tune from his old music might be use for popular american commercial song ! 
stravinsky , near the age of eighty , be like a lost and frantic bird , flit from one abandoned nest to another , search for a home . 
how differently person 's life unfold . 
person be able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without lose his particular force and direction . 
in the process , his native endowment were stretch , strengthen and discipline to serve their human purpose . 
with a large and circumspect 20th century technique , he weave the material of national hero and event , national folklore and child 's fairytale - slavic dance and love song - into a solid musical literature which serve his people well , and is provide much enjoyment to the world at_large . 
of_course , it must_not be forget that in achieve this historical feat , person have the vast resource of his people behind him ; time and economic security ; symphony_orchestra , opera and ballet_company ; chorus , chamber_music ensemble ; soloist ; recording ; broadcasting ; television ; large and eager audience . 
it must be concede that his native_land provide person with many_of the necessary condition for great creative incentive : 
economic security and cultural opportunity , incisive idiom , social fermentation for a new national ideology - a sympathetic public and a large body of performer especially train to fulfill his purpose . 
thus in person the union_of_soviet_socialist_republics produce one of the great composer of the twentieth century . 
that his mood , even in his early year , be those of his people , do him honor , as his music honor those who inspire it . 
that he master every aspect of his medium according_to his own great talent and contemporary judgment , be a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressure of proclaim and practise the rigor of a new culture ; and perhaps of even greater significance - his music be strong 20th century evidence of the effectiveness of evolution , based on a broad traditionalism for the creative art of music . 
april tenth mark a memorable date in new_york 's musical history - indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern united_states . 
on that date the group , organize to furnish employment for musician unable to obtain engagement during the great_depression and to provide relief for older musician who lose their fortune in the stock_market crash , observe its 30th anniversary . 
person be essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction have a kinship with the english watercolorist of the early nineteenth century , especially the beautifully pattern art of person . 
and like this english master , person realize his subject in large , simplified mass which , though they seem effortless , be in_reality the result of skilled design bear of hard work and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspire them . 
as a boy person begin the long process of extract the goodness of the out-of-doors , its tang of weather , its change of season , its variable mood . 
his father , a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter , take his son on numerous hunting_expedition , and impart to them his knowledge and love of nature . 
out of this background of hunting and fishing , it be only natural that person first paint subject he know best : hunter in the field , fisherman in the stream , duck and goose on_the_wing - almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape . 
it is this subject_matter that has bring person a large and enthusiastic following among sportsman , but it be his exceptional performance with this motif that commend him to artist and discerning collector . 
person had_to earn the privilege of devote himself exclusively to painting . 
like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family_business which , though it be allied to art of a kind - the design and production of engraved seal - bear no relation to the painting of picture . 
but it did teach person the basic technique of commercial_art , and later , for twelve year , he and his sister person conduct an advertising art studio in location . 
on the death of their father , they return to their home in location , new_york . 
after more year of concentrated effort , person and his brother person finally establish a thriving family_business at the old stand . 
during all this time person continue to paint , first only on weekend , and_then , as the family_business permit , for longer period . 
gradually he withdraw from the shop altogether , and for the past thirty year , he has work independently as a painter , except for his continued hunting and fishing expedition . 
but even on these , the palette often take_over while the shotgun cool_off ! 
except for a rich friendship with the painter , person who give him the only professional instruction he ever have - and this was limit to a_few lesson , though the two artist often go on painting trip together - person develop his art by himself . 
in the best tradition , he first teach himself to see , then to draw with accuracy and assurance , and_then to paint . 
he work in oil for year before begin his work in watercolor , and his first public recognition and early honor , include his election to the academy , be for his essay in the heavy medium . 
gradually watercolor claim his greater affection until today it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique . 
it has be my privilege to paint with person on numerous occasion , mostly in the vicinity of location . 
more_often_than_not i have find easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where i could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed , not imitative , painting . 
what i have observe time_and_time_again be a process of integration , integration that begin as abstract design and gradually take_on recognizable form ; color pattern that are make to weave throughout the whole composition ; and that overall , amazing control of large wash which be the person stylemark . 
finally come those little flick of a rigger brush and the job be done . 
inspiring - yes ; instructive - maybe ; duplicable - no ! 
but for the technical fact , we have the artist 's own testimony : 
`` of_late year , i find that i like well to work out_of_doors . 
first i make preliminary watercolor sketch in quarter scale ( approximately * * f inch ) in which i pay particular attention to the design principle of three simple value - the light light , the middle tone , and the dark dark - by reduce the form of my subject to these large pattern . 
if a human figure or wildlife are to be part of the projected final picture , i try to place them in the initial sketch . 
for me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceive in this early stage , though i freely admit that i do not hesitate to add or eliminate figure on the full sheet when it serve my final purpose . 
`` i be thoroughly convinced that most watercolor suffer because the artist expect nature will do his composing for him ; as a result , such picture be only a literal translation of what the artist find in the scene before him . 
just because a tree or other object appear in a certain spot be absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting , unless the position serve the design of the whole composition . 
if the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain unit in his design , often only slightly , fine picture would result . 
out of long experience i have find that incidental figure and other object like tree , log , and bush can be trace from the original sketch and move about in the major area on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which i call ' click ' . 
`` speed in paint a picture be valid only when it impart spontaneity and crispness , but unless the artist have lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution , he would do_well to take these first sketch and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition . 
`` if i have seem to emphasize the structure of the composition , i mean to project equal concern for color . 
often , in work out_of_doors under all condition of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that look favorable in_relation_to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when view indoors in a mat . 
when this occur , i make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor - if i have been work on a full sheet in the field . 
`` when work from one of my sketch i square_up it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal . 
when this linear draft is complete , i dust it down to a faint image . 
from this point , i paint in as direct a manner as possible , by flow on the wash with as pure a color mixture as i can manage . 
however , first i thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the line i have describe . 
then i plan my attack : the part i will finish first , the range of value , the accenting of minor detail - all_in_all , mechanics of produce the finished job with a maximum of crispness . 
the longer i work , the more i be sure that for me , at_least , a workmanlike method be important . 
trial_and_error be better place in the preliminary sketch than in hope for miracle in the final painting . 
`` as for material , i use the best available . 
i work on a watercolor easel in the field , and frequently resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eye from undue strain . 
in my studio i work at a tilt-top_table , but leave the paper unfixed so that i can move it freely to control the wash . 
i have use a variety of heavyweight handmade paper , but prefer an english make , rough surface , in 400 - pound weight . 
after select a sheet and inspect it for flaw ( even the best sometimes have foreign ' nubbin ' on its surface ) , i sponge it thoroughly on both side with clean , cold water . 
then i dry the sheet under mild pressure so that it will lie flat as a board . 
`` in_addition_to the usual tool , i make constant use of cleansing tissue , not_only to wipe my brush , but to mop_up certain area , to soften edge , and to open_up light in dark wash . 
the great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that it be easy to control than a sponge make it an ideal tool for the watercolorist . 
i also use a small electric hand_blower to dry large wash in the studio . 
`` my brush be different from those use by most watercolorist , for i combine the sable and the bristle . 
the red sable be 8 ; two rigger , 6 and 10 ; and a very large , flat wash brush . 
the bristle be a fitch 2 and a one-half inch brush shave to a sharp chisel edge . 
`` my usual palette consist_of top-quality color : 
alizarin_crimson , orange , raw_sienna , raw_umber , burnt_sienna , sepia , cerulean_blue , cobalt_blue , french_ultramarine_blue , windsor_green , hooker's_green 2 , cadmium_yellow pale , yellow_ochre , payne's_gray , charcoal_gray , davy's_gray , and ivory_black '' . 
in analyze the watercolor of person , the first thing that come_to_mind be their essential decorativeness , yet this word have such a varied connotation that it need some elaboration here . 
true , a person watercolor be unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory . 
unlike many decorative pattern that present a static flat convention , this artist 's picture be full of atmosphere and climate . 
long observation has teach person that most landscape can be reduce to three essential plane : a foreground in sharp focus - either a light area with dark accent or a dark one with light ; a middle_distance often contain the major motif ; and a background , usually a silhouette form foil against the sky . 
in follow this general principle , person provide the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth be instantly create . 
when paint , person 's physical eye be half closed , while his mind's_eye be wide-open , and this circumstance account_for in part for the impression he wish to convey . 
he does not insist on tell all he know about any given subject ; rather his picture invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia . 
it is for this reason that person avoid select subject that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment . 
his picture generalize , though they are inspire by a particular locale ; they universalize in_terms_of weather , sky , earth , and people . 
by deal with common landscape in an uncommon way , person has find a particular niche in american landscape art . 
living with his watercolor be a vicarious experience of see nature distill through the eye of a sensitive interpreter , a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the creator of it all . 
the artist be_born in location , new_york , in 1886 , and until two year ago when he and his wife move to california , he live in western new_york , in location . 
when i look_up the actual date of his birth and find it to be march 15th , i realize that person be_born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist : 
the water sign of pisces ( february 18 - march 20 ) . 
and how very often a water plane is feature in his landscape , and how appropriate that he should appear in american_artist again , in his natal month of march ! 
over the year , begin in 1929 , person has been award seventeen major prize include two gold medal ; two ranger_fund_purchase_awards ; the joseph_pennell_memorial_medal ; two american_watercolor_society_prizes ; the blair_purchase_prize for watercolor , location of chicago ; and_others in location , new_york , location , new_haven , location , location , and most_recently , the $ 300 prize for a watercolor at the group , 
he was elect to the group as an associate in the oil class in 1931 ( after receive his first ranger_fund_purchase_prize at the group in 1930 ) , and elevate to academicianship in 1940 . 
other membership include the group , group , group , group , group . 
every taxpayer be well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our reader also realize that a large portion of these expenditure go for military electronics . 
we have note how some electronic technique , develop for the defense effort , have eventually been use in commerce and industry . 
the host of novel application of electronics to medical problem be far more thrilling because of their implication in matter concern our health and vitality . 
when we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect be staggering . 
the author has recently study the field of medical electronics and has been convince that , in this area alone , the application of electronic_equipment have enormous possibility . 
the benefit electronics can bring to biomedicine may be greater by_far than any previous medical discovery . 
we use the term `` biomedicine '' because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research . 
electronics has been apply to medicine for many year in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray_machine , the electrocardiograph , and the diathermy_machine . 
recently many doctor have install ultrasonic vibration machine for deep massage of bruise , contusion , and simple bursitis . 
commonly use electronic_device which are find in practically every hospital be closed_circuit tv and audio_system for internal paging and instruction , along with radiation counter , timer , and similar device . 
in this article we will concentrate_on the advance in the application of electronics in biomedical research laboratory because this be where tomorrow 's commonplace equipment originate . 
from the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic technique perfect in the past few year we have select a_few example which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tool in medical research . 
many cell , bacteria , and other microorganism be transparent to visible_light and must be stain for microscopic investigation . 
this stain often disrupt the normal cell activity or_else color only the outside . 
a completely new insight into living cell and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replace visible_light with ultraviolet_radiation and combine a microscope with a color - television_system to view the result . 
fig 1 be a simplified block_diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system develop at the group of group . 
by combine the talent of a medical_man , person , a biophysicist , person , and an electronics expert , person , this novel technique has been develop which promise to open broad avenue to understand life process . 
three different wavelength of ultraviolet_radiation are select by the variable filter place in_front_of the three mercury xenon light which serve as the ultraviolet source . 
these wavelength are reflect in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror ; the specimen is magnify by the microscope . 
instead of the observer 's eye the image_orthicon in the television_camera do the `` looking '' . 
the microscope and orthicon are both select to operate well into the ultraviolet_spectrum , which mean that all lens must be quartz . 
the video signal is amplify and then switch , in synchronism with the three ultraviolet_light source which are sequence by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of a second only one wavelength , correspond to red , green , or blue , is see . 
( note : 
because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source to another , the light are switch by a commutator like assembly rotate by a synchronous_motor . 
this assembly also supply a 20 - cps switching gate for the electronics circuitry . ) 
this be the same system as was use in the field sequential color_tv system which precede the present simultaneous system . 
three separate amplifier then drive a 21 - inch tricolor tube . 
the result be a color picture of the specimen where the primary color correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelength . 
many_of the cell and microorganism which be transparent to visible_light , absorb or reflect the much short wavelength of the ultraviolet_spectrum . 
different part of these cell sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelength so that it be often possible to see internal portion of cell in a different color . 
where the microscope under visible_light may show only vague shadow or nothing at_all , ultraviolet_illumination and subsequent translation into a color tv picture reveal a wealth of detail . 
at the present time the research team which pioneer this new technique be primarily interested in advance and perfect it . 
the medical title of `` lobar_ventilation_in_man '' by person and person , cover a brief paper which be one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process . 
at the group , the electronics group has develop the `` respiratory_gas_analyzer '' show in fig 3 . 
this unit , affectionately dub `` the_monster '' , can be wheel to any convenient location and provide a wealth of information about the patient 's breathing . 
in the lower center rack an 8 - channel recorder indicate the percentage of carbon_dioxide and nitrogen from the upper and lower lobe of one lung , the total volume of inhalation per breath , the flow of air from both lobe , and the pressure of the two lobe with_respect_to each_other . 
usually the patient breathe into a mouthpiece while walk a treadmill , stand_still , or in some other medically significant position . 
from the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defect with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail . 
the original electrocardiograph primarily indicate irregularity in the heartbeat , but today 's technique allow exact measurement of the flow of blood through the aorta , dimensioning of the heart and its chamber , and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat . 
for many_of these measurement the chest must be open , but the blood_vessel and the heart itself remain undisturbed . 
a group of researcher at the group have give a paper which briefly outline some of these technique . 
one simple method of measure the expansion of the heart be to tie a thin rubber tube , fill with mercury , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretch . 
a balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder be all the electronic instrumentation needed . 
sonar can be use to measure the thickness of the heart by place small crystal transducer at opposite side of the heart or blood_vessel and excite one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy . 
the travel time of sound in tissue be about 1500 meter per second thus it take about 16 | msec. to traverse 25 mm of tissue . 
a sonar or radar type of pulse_generator and time-delay_measuring_system be required for body tissue evaluation . 
in_addition to the heart and aorta , successful measurement of liver and spleen have also been make by this technique . 
the doppler_effect , use ultrasonic signal , can be employ to measure the flow of blood without cut into the blood_vessel . 
a still more sophisticated system has been devise for determine the effective power of the heart itself . 
it use both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carry a thermistor insert into the bloodstream . 
the latter measure the heat carry_away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow . 
it be also possible to utilize a pressure transducer , mounted at the end of a catheter which is insert into the heart 's left_ventricle , to indicate the blood_pressure in the heart itself . 
this pressure measurement may be make at_the_same_time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is make . 
a simplified version of the instrumentation for this procedure is show in fig 2 . 
output of the two system are measure by a pulse_timing_circuit and a resistance bridge , follow by a simple analogue_computer which feed a multichannel_recorder . 
from this doctor can read heart_rate , change in diameter , pressure , and effective heart power . 
several year ago headline were make by a small radio_transmitter capsule which could be swallow by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receiver . 
this original capsule contain a battery and a transistor oscillator and be about 1 cm in diameter . 
battery life limit the use of this `` pill '' to about 8 to 30 hour maximum . 
a refinement of this technique has been describe by person and person and person of the group of the group . 
in this novel arrangement the `` pill '' be much smaller and contain only a resonant circuit in_which the capacitor is form by a pressure sense transducer . 
as show in fig 4 , an external antenna is place over or around the patient and excite 3000 time a second with short 400 - kc burst . 
the energy receive by the `` pill '' cause the resonant circuit to `` ring '' on after the burst and this `` ring '' take_place at the resonant frequency of the `` pill '' . 
these frequency are amplify and detect by the fm receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and , after the `` pill '' has been calibrate , precise internal pressure indication can be obtain . 
one of the advantage of_this method be that the `` pill '' can remain in the patient for several day , permit observation under natural condition . 
application to organ other_than the gastrointestinal tract are plan for future experiment . 
one of the most gratifying application of an important technique of submarine detection be in the exploration of the human_body . 
our reader be familiar with the principle of sonar where sound_wave are send_out in water and the echo then indicate submerged object . 
various method of pulse , scan , and display these sound_wave are use to detect submarine , map ocean_floor , and even communicate under water . 
in medicine the frequency be much high , transducer and the sonar beam themselves be much small , and different scan technique may be use , but the principle involved be the same as in sonar . 
because the body contain so much liquid , transmission of ultrasonic signal proceed fairly well in muscle and blood_vessel . 
bone and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signal . 
base on this phenomenon , a number of investigator have use this method to `` look through '' human organ . 
a good_example of the result obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contain in paper present by person who has explore the human eye . 
he can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional method indicate blindness due_to glaucoma . 
the method use to scan the eye ultrasonically is illustrate in fig 6 . 
the transducer is couple to the body through a water bath , not show . 
for display , person use a portion of an * * f , an airborne radar indicator , and_then photograph the screen to obtain a permanent record . 
a typical `` sonogram '' of a human eye , together with a description of the anatomical part , is show in fig 5 . 
the frequency use for these experiment be 15 mc and the transducer be a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of provide beam diameter small than one millimeter . 
the transducer itself move the beam in a sector scan , just like a radar antenna , while the entire transducer structure is move over a 90 - degree arc in_front_of the eye to `` look_into '' all corner . 
the total picture is only see by the camera which integrate the many sector scan over the entire 90 - degree rotation period . 
person and person at the group have apply the same sonar technique to other area of soft tissue and have obtain extremely good result . 
by submerge the patient in a tub and rotate the transducer while the scan go_on , they have been able to get cross-section view of the neck , as show in fig 7 , as_well_as many other hitherto impossible insight . 
as mention before , bone reflect the sound energy and in fig 7 the portion of the spine show as the black area in the center . 
artery and vein be apparent by their black , blood-filled center and the surrounding white wall . 
a cross_section of a normal lower human leg is show in fig 8 with the various part label . 
person 's boyhood represent a minimal chance of either attain greatness or serve his people so well and over so long a span of life . 
he was bear in the small danish town of location on the island of location in the south-central part of denmark on august fourteenth , 1777 . 
his father person be the village apothecary whose slender income make it difficult to feed his family , let_alone educate them in a town without even a school . 
the two older boy , person and person , his junior by a year , therefore go daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in german ; his wife teach the two boy to read and write danish . 
other brother later join them for instruction with person , the wigmaker , and also arithmetic was add to bible reading , german , and danish in the informal curriculum . 
person 's contribution were soon exhaust and the boy had to turn_to a wide circle of the town 's learned , such_as the pastor , to supplement the simple teaching . 
from the town surveyor , person learn drawing and mathematics and , from a university_student , some academic subject . 
the mayor of the town teach them english and french . 
whatever person or person learn separately they pass_on to each other ; they read every book that they could borrow in the village . 
at 12 , person be sufficiently mature to help his father in the apothecary shop , which help stimulate his interest in medicine and science . 
his early love for literature and history remain with him for his entire life . 
in 1793 the brother decide to enter the group ( found in 1479 ) and the following spring find them at the university prepare to matriculate for the autumn session . 
while person devote himself to the science of medicine , physics , and astronomy , his brother study law . 
the brother continue to help each other during their study , share a joint purse , lodge together in the dormitory and dine together at the home of their aunt . 
they supplement their income by small government assistance , by tutor and economize wherever they could . 
so impressive be those serious year of study at the university that person later write , `` to be perfectly free , the young man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and imagination ; there be a struggle there , in which , if he fall , it be easy for him to rise again , there be freedom of utterance there , which draw after it no irreparable consequence on society . 
i live in this onward driving contest where each day overcome a new difficulty , gain a new truth , or banish a previous error '' . 
he openly proclaim his pleasure in lecture and write_about science . 
in_this third year at the university , person , in 1797 , was award the first important token of recognition , a gold medal for his essay on `` limits_of_poetry_and_prose '' . 
he complete his training in pharmacy also , take his degree with high honor in 1797 , and in 1799 was award the degree of doctor_of_philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine . 
he propose a fresh theory of alkali which later was accept in chemical practice . 
person 's student day be at_a time when europe be in a new intellectual ferment follow the revolution in america and in france , germany and italy were rise from divisive nationalism and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweep the continent . 
the new century open with person begin his professional career in_charge of an apothecary shop in copenhagen and as lecturer at the university . 
he was stir by the announcement of person 's discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately apply the voltaic_pile to experiment with acid and alkali . 
the following year he devote to the customary `` wanderjahr '' , travel in germany , france , and the_netherlands , meet the philosopher person , person , and person . 
he also meet person ( bear person in location . ) who was then serve the person , and the physicist person ; these be person 's main contact in science . 
from location ^ ttingen ( 1801 ) where he stay for 10 day , he write , `` the first question ask everywhere be about galvanism . 
as everybody be curious to see the battery of glass tube i have invent , i have had quite a small one make here of four glass tube ( in copenhagen i use 30 ) and intend to carry it with me '' . 
person join person at location and stay with him for 3 week , continue their correspondence after he leave . 
with person he was expose to the fantastic profusion of idea that storm through his host 's fertile but disorganized mind . 
person remodel person 's note into an essay in french which was submit to the group for its annual prize of 3000 franc . 
the sound discovery of_this quixotic genius were so dilute by those of fantasy that the prize was never award to him . 
in may , 1803 , person , in another flight of fancy , write to person a letter that contain a remarkable prophecy . 
he relate event on earth to periodic celestial phenomenon and indicate that the year of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincide with the year of important electrical discovery . 
thus , 1745 correspond to the invention of the `` leiden_jar '' jar by person , 1764 that of the electrophorus by person , 1782 produce the condenser of person , and 1801 the voltaic_pile . 
person proceed , `` you now emerge into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820 , you will have to reckon . 
this we might well witness '' . 
person die in 1810 and person not_only live to see the event occur but be the author of it . 
in 1803 person return to copenhagen and apply for the university 's chair in physics but was reject because he was probably consider more a philosopher than a physicist . 
however , he continue experiment and lecture , publishing the result of his experiment in german and danish periodical . 
in 1806 his ambition was realize and he become professor of physics at the group , though not realize full professorship ( ordinarius ) until 1817 . 
during person 's attendance at the university , it was poorly equip with physical apparatus for experiment in the science . 
he be , however , fortunate in his contact with person ( 1769 - 1842 ) , teacher of chemistry , who , in_addition to his academic chair , be also proprietor of the `` lion_pharmacy '' in copenhagen where person assist him . 
person maintain a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which be at person 's disposal during and after his graduation . 
in 1800 , person go abroad and person was appoint manager of the lion_pharmacy . 
in february 1801 , person did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and report experiment make with a voltaic_battery of 600 plate of zinc and silver and of later experiment with a battery of 60 plate of zinc and lead . 
in the following year , 1803 , person , simultaneously with person , discover that acid increase the strength of a voltaic_battery more_than did salt . 
eager as he be to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded_down with the management of the pharmacy and lecture in the medical and pharmaceutical faculty at the university that he could devote only sunday afternoon to `` galvanizing '' . 
he assume his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had mark every step in his rise from boyhood . 
the university be the only one in denmark and the status of professor represent the upper social level . 
his broad interest in literary , political , and philosophical movement open many door to him . 
his friend be numerous and their tie to him be strong . 
the year 1812 and 1813 see him in germany and france again , but on this visit to berlin he did not seek_out the philosopher as he had on his first journey . 
in berlin he publish his view of the chemical law_of_nature in german and this was issue in french translation ( paris , 1813 ) under the title recherches_sur_l_'_identite_des_forces_chimiques_et_electriques , a work hold in very high esteem by the new generation of research chemist . 
his interest in find a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicate . 
chapter 8 , is entitle `` on_magnetism '' and in it are include such remark as , `` one has always been tempt to compare the magnetic_force with the electrical force . 
the great resemblance between electrical and magnetic_attraction and repulsion and the similarity of their law necessarily would bring_about this comparison . 
it be true , that nothing has been find comparable_with electricity by communication ; but the phenomenon observe have such a degree of analogy to those depending_on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest difference . 
the form of galvanic activity be halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form . 
there , force be more latent than in electricity , and less than in magnetism . 
but in such an important question , we would be satisfied if the judgment be that the principal objection to the identity of force which produce electricity and magnetism be only a difficulty , and not a thing which be contrary to_it . 
one could also add to these analogy that steel lose its magnetism by heat , which prove that steel become a better conductor through a rise in temperature , just as electrical body do . 
it is also find that magnetism exist in all body of nature , as prove by person and person . 
by that , one feel that magnetic_force be as general as electrical force . 
an attempt should be make to see if electricity , in its most latent stage , have any action on the magnet as_such '' . 
his plan and intent were clearly chart . 
person return in 1814 and resume an active part in university and political discussion . 
in one debate he support the freedom of judgment as_opposed_to dogma , in another he hold that the practice of science be in_fact an act of religious worship . 
he continue as a popular lecturer . 
he devise a detonating_fuse in which a short wire was cause to glow by an electric_current . 
in 1819 under royal command he undertake a very successful geological expedition to location , one of the danish island , be one of three scientist in the expedition . 
it was with the assistance of one of the member of_this expedition , person , that person succeed in produce light by create an electric_discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric_current was make to flow . 
together they also develop a new form of voltaic_cell in which the wooden trough was replace by one of copper , thereby produce strong current . 
person be among those who witness person 's first demonstration of his discovery . 
the association between electric ( both electrostatic and voltaic ) force and magnetic_force had been recognize by investigator for many decade . 
electrical literature contain numerous reference to lightning that had magnetize iron and had alter the polarity of compass needle . 
in the late 1700 's person and person , among others , had magnetize iron by send an electrostatic charge through it . 
person had almost stumble on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a leyden_jar was send transversally through a piece of watch spring steel make its end magnetic . 
the resulting magnetic effect prove strong than when the discharge was make lengthwise . 
the experiment of person and_others have already been note but no one had determine the cause and effect relationship between these two primary force . 
person 's own earlier experiment be unimpressive , possibly because he had , like other experimenter , lay the conducting_wire across the compass needle instead_of parallel with_it . 
the sequence of event lead to his important discovery still remain ambiguous but it seem that one of the advanced student at the university relate that the first direct event that lead to the publication of person 's discovery occur during a private lecture make before a group of other advanced student in the spring of 1820 . 
at this lecture person happen to place the conducting_wire over and parallel to a magnetic_needle . 
know specifically what the many feed additive can do and_how and when to feed them can make a highly competitive business more profitable for beef_man , dairyman , and sheepman . 
the target chart quickly and briefly tell you which additive do what . 
all the additive list here are sanction for use by the group of the federal_government . 
all comment concern effectiveness and use of drug have been carefully review by a veterinary medical officer with group .

additive should not be feed 72 hour before animal are slaughter . 
there be three principal feed_bunk type for dairy_cattle and beef_cattle : ( 1 ) fence_line bunk - cattle eat from one side while feed is put_in from the opposite side of the fence by self unloading wagon ; ( 2 ) mechanized bunk - they sit within the feedlot , are fill by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface ; ( 3 ) special bunk - as discuss here , they permit cattle to eat from all side . 
feed is put_in with an elevator . 
several material or combination of material can be use to construct a satisfactory feed_bunk . 
the selection of material depend_on skill of available labor for installation , cost of material available locally , and your own preference . 
no one material be best for all situation . 
select bunk by economic comparison be usually an individual problem . 
animal eat only from one side , so the fence_line bunk must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk . 
these bunk also serve as a fence , so part of the additional cost must be attribute to the fence . 
because of their location , on the edge of the feedlot , fence_line bunk be not in_the_way_of mechanical manure removal . 
fill these bunk by the same self unloading wagon use to fill silo spread cost of the wagon over more time and operation . 
all-weather road must be provide next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all year . 
this will be a problem in area of heavy snowfall . 
marketing in the new decade will be no picnic - for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experience in the last 20 - 25 yr . 
why ? 
company of all type have make great advance in production capability and efficiency - in modern equipment and new process , enlarged r_+_d facility , fast new product development . 
many company have upgrade their sale manpower and test new selling , distribution , and promotion technique to gain a bigger competitive edge . 
given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problem will your company face in the next 10 yr ? 
based on our experience with client , we see 14 major problem which fall_into three broad group - the marketplace itself , marketing method , and marketing management . 
there has been an intensification of price consciousness in recent year ; there is every indication it will continue . 
frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price consciousness has been foster by manufacturer , distributor , and dealer . 
despite generally good level of income , we see great price pressure than ever before - travel back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer . 
here are some key area to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target : 
has the probable price situation in your field been forecast as a basis for future planning ? 
have cost study been make of every phase of your operation to determine what might be do if thing get worse ? 
have you actually check_out ( not just mentally test ) different selling approach design to counter the price competition problem ? 
average consumer is become more sophisticated regarding product and advertising claim , partly because of widespread criticism of such assertion . 
this problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kind of business . 
have you examine this problem of increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company ? 
need for service be here to stay - and the problem is going_to be tough to solve in the sixties . 
there are two reason for this . 
first , most product tend to become more complex . 
second , in a competitive market , the customer feel his weight and throw it around . 
provide good customer service require as thorough a marketing and general management planning job as the original selling of the product . 
too often it is think_of at the last moment of new product introduction . 
good service start with product design and planning : 
many product seem to be design for a production economy , not for a service one . 
proper follow-through require train your own sale organization , and your distributor organization , not_only in the technique but also in good customer relations . 
have you assess the importance of service and give it proper attention ? 
in spend his money today , the consumer is pull in many direction . 
to the manufacturer of the more convenient type product - the purchase of which can be switch , delay , or put_off entirely - the implication be important . 
your competition be now proportionately greater - you are compete not_only against manufacturer in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturer of other appealing consumer product . 
many industry trade association are develop campaign to protect or enhance the share of the consumer 's dollar being spend on their particular product . 
has your company think through its strategy in this whole `` discretionary buying '' area ? 
the trend have be in_evidence for many year - population_shift to the location and location , and from city to suburb . 
these population_shift will continue in the next 10 yr . 
have you consider the implication of continuing geographic population_shift in_terms_of sales_force allocation , strength of distributor organization , and even plant location ? 
we have already witness great change through merger and acquisition in the food industry - at both the manufacturing and retail end . 
instead of relatively small sale to many account , there are now larger sale to or through fewer account . 
the change may require different product , pricing , packaging , warehousing , salesmanship , advertising and executive attention - practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjust . 
have you examine these trend , forecast the effect , and plan your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing circumstance ? 
in the area of private label competition , it be logical to expect a continuation of trend which have be underway during the first decade . 
as mass dealer and distributor organization grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share_in the manufacturer 's as_well as the distributor 's profits - which be , in_effect , what the sale of private brand tend to do . 
average manufacturer frequently has help build private brand business , deliver largely the same quality and style in private brand merchandise as in branded . 
moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlet and chain_store have insist on high_quality - and the customer seem to have catch_on . 
if you be up_against private brand competition , have you formulate a long-term program for research and strengthen your market position ? 
if private brand competition has n't been feel in your product field as_yet , have you think how you will cope with it if and when it does appear ? 
display merchandising , back by pre selling through advertising and promotion , will continue to make stride in the sixties . 
it have multiple implication and possible headache for your marketing program . 
how can you cash_in_on this fast-growing type of outlet and still maintain relationship with old existing outlet which be still important ? 
if you have a high quality product , how can you make it stand_out - justify its premium price - without the spoken word ? 
salesmanship be still necessary , but it be a different brand of salesmanship . 
have you carefully examine the selling technique which best suit your product ? 
have you study the caliber and sale approach of your sales_force in_relation_to requirement for effective marketing ? 
are you experiment with different selling slant in develop new customer ? 
some distribution cost are keep up by competitive pressure , some by the fact that the customer have come to expect certain nicety and flourish . 
no manufacturer has take the initiative in point_out the cost involved . 
the use of bulk handling is continuously grow . 
computer are being use to keep branch inventory at more workable level . 
`` selective selling '' - concentrate sale on the larger account - has been use effectively by some manufacturer . 
there may be possible economy at any one of a number of link in your marketing and distribution chain . 
do you have a program for scrutinize all these link regularly and carefully - and with some imagination ? 
in your sales_force , will a smaller number of high-priced , high quality salesman serve you best , or can you make_out better with a larger number of low paid salesman ? 
will your trade customer settle for less attention and fewer frills in_return_for some benefit they can share ? 
in one company cover the country with a high quality sales_force of 10 men , the president personally phone each major account every 6 month . 
as a result , distribution_cost were cut , customer relations improve . 
distribution_cost be almost bind to increase in the sixties - and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative way of do the job . 
from the manufacturer 's point_of_view , the increasing cost of advertising and promotion be a very real problem to be face in the sixties . 
it is accentuate by the need for pre selling goods , and private label competition . 
how much fundamental thinking and research has your company do on its advertising program ? 
are you follow competition willy-nilly - try to match dollar for dollar - or are you experiment with new means for reach and influence consumer ? 
have you evaluate the proper place of advertising and all phase of promotion in your total marketing program - from the standpoint of effort , money , and effectiveness ? 
practically all forecast mention new and exciting product on the horizon . 
will you be out in the marketplace with some of these sale building new product ? 
if competition beat you to_it , this exciting new product era can have real headache in_store . 
on_the_other_hand , the process of obsoleting an old product and introduce the new one be usually mighty expensive . 
as market become larger and marketing more complex , the cost of an error become progressively larger . 
is your r_+_d or product development program tuned in to the commercial reality of the market ? 
are there regular communication from the field , or meeting of sale and marketing personnel with r_+_d people ? 
technical knowledge be a wonderful thing , but it be useless unless it eventually feed the cash_register . 
are there individual in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization ; who can develop reliable estimate of sale volume , production , and distribution_cost ; and translate the whole into profit_and_loss and balance_sheet figure which management can act_on with some assurance ? 
we have see good new product shelve because no one have the assignment to develop such fact and plan - and management could n't make_up_one's_mind . 
there is a shortage of salesman today . 
in the future , quantitative demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy , and the qualitative need will be greater still . 
while many company have do fine work in develop sale personnel , much of it has be product rather than sale training . 
nor has the training be enough in_relation_to the need . 
most marketing people agree it is going_to take redoubled effort to satisfy future requirement . 
have you estimate your sale manpower need for the future ( both quantitatively and qualitatively ) ? 
has your company develop selection and training process that are gear to provide the caliber of salesman you will need in the next 10 yr ? 
with the growing complexity of market and intensity of competition , sale management , whether at the district , region or headquarters level , be a tough job today - and it will be tough in_the future . 
men qualified for the broad task of marketing manager be even more scarce due_to the demanding combination of qualification call_for by this type of management work . 
the growth of business has outdistance the available supply , and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties . 
does your company have a program for select and develop sale and marketing management_personnel for the long term ? 
does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep topnotch marketing people ? 
every single problem touch_on thus_far be related to good marketing planning . 
`` hip-pocket '' tactic are going_to be hard to apply . 
many food and beverage company be already on a highly planned basis . 
they have to be . 
with greater investment in plant facility , with automation growing , you can n't switch around , either in volume or in product design , as much as be formerly possible - or at_least not as economically . 
are planning and strategy development emphasize sufficiently in your company ? 
we find too many sale and marketing executive so burdened with detail that they are short-change planning . 
are annual marketing plan review throughout your management group to get the perspective of all individual and get everyone on the marketing team ? 
do you have a long-term ( 5 - or 10 - yr . ) marketing program ? 
the key to effective marketing be wrapped_up in define your company 's marketing problem realistically . 
solution frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problem , whether they be in the market , in marketing method or in marketing management . 
if company will take the time to give objective consideration to their major problem and to the question they provoke , then a long constructive step will have been take toward more effective marketing in next decade . 
how long has it be since you review the objective of your benefit and service program ? 
have you permit it to become a giveaway program rather than one that have the goal of improved employee morale and , consequently , increased productivity ? 
what effort do you make to assess result of your program ? 
do you measure its relation_to reduced absenteeism , turnover , accident , and grievance , and to improved quality and output ? 
have you set specific objective for your employee publication ? 
is it reach these goal ? 
be it larger or fancy than you really need ? 
are you use the most economical printing method , paper , etc. . 
be there other , cheap communication technique that could be substitute ? 
has your attitude toward employee benefit encourage an excess of free `` government '' work in your plant ? 
is your purchasing_agent offer too_much free buying service for employee ? 
when improvement are recommend in working condition - such_as lighting , restroom , eating facility , air-conditioning - do you try to set a measure of their effectiveness on productivity ? 
when negotiate with your union , do you make sure employee have a choice between new benefit and their cent per hour cost in wage . 
can you consider restrict any additional employee benefit to those pay for by profit_sharing money , such_as was do in the union contract recently sign by group ? 
do your employee understand all the benefit to which your insurance entitle them ? 
are they encourage to take_advantage full legal advantage of these benefit ? 
have you publicize the cent per hour value of the company 's share of insurance_premium ? 
when did you last compare your present premium cost with the cost of insurance from other source ? 
can your insurance_company aid you in reduce administrative cost ? 
do you try to maintain the principle of employee contribute ( as oppose to fully company paid ) program ? 
do you protect your holiday privilege with an attendance requirement both before and after the holiday ? 
do you plan to limit additional holiday to area and / or industrial pattern ? 
have you investigate the possibility of move midweek holiday forward to monday or back to friday in_order to have an uninterrupted work week ? 
are you carefully police washup time and rest period to be certain that all other time be productive ? 
are you watch work schedule for boiler operator , guard , and other 24 - hour day , 7 - day week operation in_order to minimize overtime ? 
are you careful to restrict the number of people on_leave at_one_time so that your total employment obligation be minimized ? 
have you consider use vending equipment to replace or reduce the number of cafeteria employee ? 
what be the possibility for operate your cafeteria for a single shift only and rely_upon vending_machine or prepackaged sandwich for the second - and third shift operation ? 
have you check the cost of subcontract your cafeteria operation in_order to save administrative cost ? 
are there possibility of having cafeteria help work part-time on custodial or other job ? 
can stagger lunch period relieve the capacity strain on your feeding facility ? 
would it be feasible to limit the menu in_order to reduce feeding cost ? 
have you consider gradual withdrawal of subsidy to your in plant feeding operation ? 
are you utilize cafeteria space for company meeting or discussion ? 
are your expense in this area commensurate with the number of employee who benefit from your program ? 
have you audit your program recently to weed_out those phase that draw least participation ? 
do employee contribute their share of money to recreational_facility ? 
have you consider delegate operational responsibility to your employee association and carefully restrict your plant 's financial contribution ? 
could an employee 's garden club take_over partial care of plant grounds ? 
would a camera club be useful in take picture pertinent to plant safety ? 
are you spending too much money on team uniform that benefit only a_few employee ? 
are you underwrite expensive team trip ? 
are you utilize vending_machine proceeds to help pay for your program ? 
do you know the trend in your cost of maintain access_road and parking_lot ? 
if you use parking attendant , can they be replace by automatic parking gate ? 
will your local bus_company erect and / or maintain the bus_stop at your plant ? 
if you provide inter plant transportation , can this be replace by available public transportation ? 
if you use company transportation to meet train or to haul visitor , would taxi be cheap ? 
how efficient and necessary be your intra company vehicle ? 
can they be reschedule ? 
can part-time driver be assign to other productive work ? 
which be more economical for your plant - a vacation shutdown or spaced vacation that require extra employee for vacation fill-in ? 
can vacation be space throughout the 12 month to minimize the number of employee fill-in ? 
do you insist that unneeded salary employee take their vacation during plant shutdown ? 
what can your sale and purchasing_department do to curtail order , shipment , and receipt during vacation shutdown period ? 
is an arbitrary retirement age of 65 actually cost your plant money ? 
what sort of effort do you make to assure that old or disabled worker be fully productive ? 
would early retirement of nonproductive , disabled employee reduce the number of make-work job ? 
will your union accept seniority concession in assign work for old or disabled employee ? 
can you share medical facility and staff with neighboring plant ? 
if you have a full-time doctor now , can he be replace with a part-time doctor or one who serve on a fee per case basis only ? 
can your plant nurse be replace by a trained first_aid man who work full-time on some_other assignment ? 
do you rigidly distinguish between job - and non job connected health_problem and avoid treat the latter ? 
are you indiscriminately offer unnecessary medical services - flu shot , sun lamp treatment , etc. ? 
if you have an annual or regular physical examination program , be it worth what it is cost you ? 
consider what you can afford to spend and what your goal be before set_up or revamp your employee benefit program . 
too many plant official be all_too eager to buy a package program from an insurance_company simply because it work for another plant . 
but even if that other plant employ the same number of worker and make the same product , there be other fact to consider . 
how old be your working force ? 
what 's your profit_margin ? 
in what section of the country be you located ? 
be you in a rural or urban_area ? 
these factor can make the difference between waste and efficiency in any benefit program . 
above_all , do n't set_up extravagant fringe_benefit just to buy employee good_will . 
union stress fringe_benefit , but the individual hourly worker prefer cash every time . 
aim to balance your employee benefit package . 
some plant go overboard on one type of fringe - say a liberal retirement plan - and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere . 
they 're ask_for union trouble . 
if you want credit for your employee services program , let your worker know what they 're entitle to . 
encourage them to exercise their benefit . 
this can be do by story in your house_organ , poster , special publication , letter to worker ' home as_well_as by_word_of_mouth through your chain of command . 
some company find a little imagination helpful . 
group , kansas_city , missouri , have a do-it-yourself quiz game called `` benefit_bafflers '' , which it distribute to employee . 
group , columbus , give all its worker a facsimile checkbook - each check show the amount the company spend on a particular fringe . 
group , new_york , pass out a form itemize the value of benefit . 
the blue-collar worker thus know his insurance package , for_example , cost $ 227.72 . 
have the insurance_company or your own accounting department break_down the cost of your insurance package periodically . 
you may find certain coverage cost much more_than be economically feasible , thereby alert you to desirable revision . 
check to see if some of your benefit - such_as on_the_job disability pay - can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a saving to you . 
use deductible insurance wherever feasible . 
it can put an end to marginal claim which play havoc with your insurance rate . 
also , beware of open-ended policy , especially in the medical field . 
this will mean that every time there 's an increase in hospital rate your cost will go_up in like manner . 
put a dollar and cent limit on benefit . 
do n't go overboard on insurance that pay benefit only upon death . 
generally , your employee will greatly appreciate benefit that protect him during his working life or during retirement . 
in grant bereavement leave , specify the maximum time_off and list what the worker 's relation to the deceased must be to qualify . 
thus , you avoid headache when an employee want off for his fourth cousin 's funeral . 
also , reserve the right to demand proof of death despite the fact that you 'll probably never use it . 
coffee_break can be a real headache if not regulated . 
vending_machine can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting waste of production time . 
if coffee is sell at the cafeteria , let a_few worker in each department get it for the whole group . 
consider install supplemental serve line in production area . 
make sure milk for the coffee is place in dispenser rather than in container , if you are supply the coffee . 
otherwise , you may be saddle with a good size milk bill by milk drinker . 
keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsman such_as tool and die maker can be keep on_the_job for the convenience of the company . 
and so deadhead on the payroll can be ease out at the earliest possible age . 
make sure you have minimum age and time on_the_job requirement tie into your pension plan . 
young men usually do n't think_of pension as an important job benefit factor anyhow and they be liable to change job several time before settle_down . 
choose carefully between contributory or non contributory pension plan . 
there be two side of a coin for this decision . 
worker usually think_of more of a plan they contribute to . 
and they can at_least collect the money they put_in , plus interest , when they leave the company . 
a non contributory plan usually won n't pay_off for the worker until he retire . 
thus , there be an added incentive to stay on_the_job . 
make sure you do n't pay for holiday that occur when an employee would not otherwise be work . 
these include : 
leave_of_absence , illness , and layoff . 
consider adopt a system of holiday in which time_off is grant with an eye to minimum inconvenience to the operation of the plant . 
it 's usually not too hard to sell worker on this as it give them longer holiday period . 
for_example , the friday after thanksgiving can be substitute for washington 's birthday . 
this reduce the number of expensive plant shutdown and startup . 
require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay . 
this cut the absentee_rate . 
consider use vending_machine rather than subsidize cafeteria . 
latest model serve hot meal at reasonable price , and at a profit to you . 
if a concessionaire run the cafeteria , keep_an_eye_on an eye out for quality and price . 
if the soup taste like dishwater , your employee won n't blame the concessionaire . 
you 'll take the rap . 
check your cafeteria location to make sure it be convenient for most employee . 
you may save valuable production minute with a change . 
spread your vacation period over the wide possible span of time or shut_down the plant down for two_weeks . 
this will cut the expense of vacation replacement . 
and with the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who get the choice vacation date . 
also make sure you have reasonable requirement as to hours work before a production employee be entitled to a vacation . 
you might try provide standard vacation time_off but make the vacation pay depend_on the number of hours work in the previous year . 
the long and ever increasing column of sportsman is now move_into a new era . 
modern_times have change the world beyond recognition . 
the early year of the twentieth century seem very faraway . 
but with all the change in philosophy , dress and terrain - a_few thing remain constant , include the devotion of american to the great field_sport , hunting and fishing . 
as the generation move_on , clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sport . 
sporting firearm change , markedly for the better . 
just as modern transportation has outmode the early studebaker covered_wagon , the demand of today 's sportsman and sportswoman has necessitate change in their equipment . 
the american firearm and ammunition manufacturer through diligent research and technical development have replace the muzzle_loader and slow fire single shot arm with modern fast fire autoloader , extremely accurate bolt , lever , and slide_action firearm . 
and millions of round of entirely new and modern small-arm ammunition , design for today 's hunting and target shooting . 
and due_to modern resource use and game management practice , there be still game to shoot , even with the ever expanding encroachment on land and water . 
present conservation practice regard wildlife , not as an expendable natural_resource , but as an annual harvest to be sow and also reap . 
unlimited game bag be possible and legal in more_than 40 state , on shooting_preserve ( one of the new phase of modern game management ) for five and six month each_year . 
close to two million game_bird were harvest on 1500 commercial and private shooting_preserve , and on group controlled upland game area during the 1960 - 61 season . 
the shooting development program of the group has successfully publish these fact in all major outdoor magazine , many national weekly and the trade paper . 
the most effective way to develop more place for more sportsman to shoot be to encourage properly manage shooting_preserve . 
this has be the aim of the director of the shooting development program , the new_york staff of the group , and the group shooting_preserve field consultant since the start of the program in 1954 . 
follow the kickoff of group 's shooting development program in 1954 , a most interesting meeting take_place in washington , district_of_columbia . 
the group known_as the group ( a division of the group ) initiate a conference which bring_together representative of the group , group and the group . 
this meeting was call to determine how these group might cooperate to launch what be known_as the outdoor_education_project . 
the outdoor_education_project take cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activity stress in most school program have little or no relationship to the physical and mental need and interest of later life . 
the various team sport assuredly have their place in every school , and they be important to proper physical development . 
but with the exception of professional athlete , few contact_sport and physical_education activity in our school have any carry-over in the adult life of the average american man or woman . 
follow a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by oep director person , today thousand of secondary_school , college and university have shooting and hunting education in their physical_education and recreation program . 
group 's financial support since 1955 has contribute to the success of this project in education . 
personnel assign through the shooting development program have proudly participate in over 53 state and regional workshop , at which hundred of school administrator , teacher , professor , and recreational leader have been introduce to outdoor education . 
consider that the current school age potential be 23 million youth , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many_more to reach . 
in 1959 group 's shooting development program announce a new activity design to expose thousand of teenage boy and girl to the healthy fun enjoy through the participation in the shooting sport . 
this program is now nationally known_as `` teen hunter club '' . 
teen hunter club were initially sponsor by affiliated member of the group . 
the first program was sponsor by group , location , new_york , under the direction of special event director person . 
other pilot_program were conduct by group , location , new_york ; group , detroit ; group , pittsburgh . 
other group activity follow , conduct by shopping_center , department_store , recreation equipment dealer , radio - tv station , newspaper , and other organization interested in the need exist to acquaint youngster with the proper use of sporting firearm and the development of correct attitude and appreciation related_to hunting and wise use of our natural_resources . 
group 's field men have serve as consultant and / or have participate in 75 teen hunter club activity which have reach over 40000 enthusiastic young american . 
through the effort of group 's shooting development program these shooting activity , and many others , include assist in the development of public and privately financed shoot park , trap and skeet league , rifle and pistol marksmanship program have been promote , to mention only a_few . 
the continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be make aware of the ever growing need for shooting facility and activity for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand . 
while individual sportsman be aware of this situation , too many_of our political , social , educational and even religious leader too often forget it . 
help be needed from dealer , at the grassroots level . 
the american gun and ammunition producer sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association . 
since group 's conception in 1926 , and more specifically since the adoption of the shooting development program in 1954 , millions of dollar and promotional man_hour have go_into the development of more place to_shoot for more youth and adult . 
we trust that you , as a gun and ammunition dealer , have benefit through additional sale of equipment . 
are you get top dollar from the shooting sport ? 
are you look ahead to the exploding market of millions of american boy and girl , who will grow_up to enjoy a traditional american way_of_life - range the field with a fine american gun and uniformly excellent ammunition ? 
be your sporting firearm and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizon ? 
would you like to organize teen hunter club , shooting program , and have information on season include six month of hunting with unlimited game bag on shooting_preserve ? 
ask person . 
we were camp a_few week ago on location in that land of pirate , seagull and bluefish on north_carolina 's famed location . 
this beach campground with no tree or hill present a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in_use actual use . 
with the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelter in which american are camp now . 
there were umbrella_tent , wall_tent , cottage_tent , station_wagon tent , pup_tent , pop_tent , baker tent , tent with exterior frame , camper_trailer , travel_trailers , and even a_few surplus parachute serve as sunshade over entire family camp . 
move around camp we see all kind of camp stove , lantern , cooler , bedding , game , fishing_tackle , windbreak and sunshade . 
we see similar display in the other three campground in this 70 mile long national_seashore_recreation_area . 
dealer would do_well to visit such a campground often , look at the equipment and talk with the camper . 
here you begin to appreciate the scope of the challenge and possibility face the industry . 
camping be big and get big . 
no one know where it will stop . 
almost every official who reflect on_it think this movement of american to canvas dwelling open one of the most promising of all outdoor market . 
you read various guess on how many american are camp . 
the number depend_on who is talk at the moment . 
the figure range as high as 15 million family . 
i 've hear 10 million mention often , but i be more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million family camping . 
seven million family would total 30 million american or more . 
consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather , to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable . 
harassed state park official often have more camper than they know what to do with . 
they are struggle to meet the demand for camping space , but family are being turn_away , especially on holiday weekend . 
the national_park , always popular camping place , are face the same pressure . 
the national_park_service hope by 1966 to have 30000 campsite available for 100000 camper a day - almost twice what there are at_present . 
the group care for hundred of thousand of camper in its 149 national forest and is increase its facility steadily . 
but the camper still come . 
they bring their family and tent and camp kitchen and bedding . 
they bring their fishing_rod and binoculars and bathing_suit . 
they come prepared for family fun because american in ever growing number are learn that here be the way to a fine economical vacation that become a family experience of lasting importance . 
there are a half_dozen reason help to account_for the migration to the campground . 
among them , according to the u.s. department_of_commerce , be : ( 1 ) short workweek , ( 2 ) high pay , ( 3 ) long paid_vacation , ( 4 ) better transportation , ( 5 ) early retirement , and ( 6 ) more education . 
the more people learn about their country , the more they want to learn . 
camping be family fun , and it is help more american see more of the country than they ever see before . 
but make no mistake about it , the first reason people turn_to camping be one of economy . 
here be the promise of a vacation trip they can afford . 
the group , compute the cost for two people to vacation by automobile , come_up with an average daily expenditure figure of $ 29 . 
the group then split it down this way : $ 10.50 for meal , $ 9.50 for lodging , $ 7 for gas and oil , and $ 2 for tip and miscellaneous . 
what does the camping couple do to this set of figure ? 
the $ 9.50 for lodging they save . 
because they prepare their own meal they also keep in their pocket a good portion of that $ 10.50 food bill along with most_of the tip money . 
the automobile expense be about the only vacationing cost they can n't either eliminate or pare_down drastically by camp along the way . 
where american used_to think_of a single vacation each summer , they now think_about how many vacation they can have . 
long weekend enable many to get_away from home for three or four day several time a year . 
and even if they stay in resort part of the time , they might , if the right salesman get them in tow , develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip into the wide open space . 
it would be a mistake to sell those thousand of beginning camper on the idea they 're buy the comforts of home . 
they 're not . 
home be the place to find the comforts of home . 
they 're buy fun and adventure and family experience . 
but it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable camping has become . 
this be no_longer a way_of_life for the bearded logger and the wandering cowboy . 
today 's camper want comforts , and they have them . 
and this help explain why so many people are now going camp . 
it be fun , and it be easy - so easy that there be time left after cooking , and tent keep , for the woman to get_out and enjoy outdoor fun with their family . 
camp meal be no great problem . 
neither be bed , thanks to air_mattress and sleeping_bag . 
neither be shelter , because there be one to meet the need of every camper or prospective camper . 
but there be still the sometimes complex problem of help camper choose the best equipment for their individual need . 
in tradition and in poetry , the marriage_bed be a place of unity and harmony . 
the partner each bring to it unselfish love , and each take_away an equal share of pleasure and joy . 
at its most ecstatic moment , husband and wife are elevate far above worldly care . 
everything else is close away . 
this be the ideal . 
but marriage expert say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieve . 
instead one partner or the other dominate the sexual_relationship . 
in the past , it has be the husband who has be dominant and the wife passive . 
but today there be sign that these role are being reverse . 
in a growing number of american home , marriage counselor report , the wife is take a commanding role in sexual_relationship . 
it be she who decide the time , the place , the surroundings , and the frequency of the sexual act . 
it be she who say aye or nay to the intimate question of sexual technique and mechanics - not the husband . 
the whole act is tailor to her pleasure , and not to theirs . 
beyond a certain point , of_course , no woman can be dominant - nature has see to that . 
but there be little doubt that in many marriage the wife be boss of the marital bed . 
of_course , there remain many `` old-fashioned '' marriage in which the husband maintain his supremacy . 
yet even in these marriage , psychologist say , wife are assert_oneself themselves more strongly . 
the meek , most submissive wife of today be a tiger by her mother 's or grandmother 's standard . 
to many expert , this trend be inevitable . 
they consider it simply a sign of our times . 
our society has `` emancipate '' the woman , give her new independence and new authority . 
it be only natural that she assert_oneself herself in the sexual role . 
`` the sexual_relationship does not exist in a vacuum '' , declare person , medical director of the group and author of the recent book , release from sexual tensions . 
`` it reflect what is go_on in other area of the marriage and in society itself . 
a world in which wife have take a more active role be likely to produce sexual_relationship in which wife be more self-assertive , too '' . 
yet many psychologist and marriage counselor agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous . 
it can , in_fact , wreck a marriage . 
when a husband be sexually selfish and heedless of his wife 's desire , she is cheat of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intend for her . 
and she begin to regard him as savage , bestial and unworthy . 
on_the_other_hand , wifely supremacy demean the husband , sap his self-respect , and rob him of his masculinity . 
he be a target of ridicule to his wife , and often - since private affairs rarely remain private - to the outside world as_well . 
`` a marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband 's maleness '' , declare person . 
this opinion is support by one of the nation 's leading psychiatrist , person , director of the group of the group . 
`` when the role of husband and wife are reverse , so that the wife become leader and the husband follower '' , person say , `` the effect on their whole relationship , sexual and otherwise , can be disastrous '' . 
in one extreme case , cite by a pittsburgh psychologist , an office worker 's wife refuse to have sexual_relation with her husband unless he buy her the luxury she demand . 
to win her favor , her husband first take an additional job , then desperately begin to embezzle from his employer . 
catch at_last , he was sentence to prison . 
while he be in custody his wife divorce him . 
more typical be the case of a suburban long_island housewife describe by a marriage counselor . 
this woman repeatedly complain she be `` too tired '' for marital relation . 
to please her , her husband assume some of the domestic chore . 
finally , he was cook , wash dish , bathing the child , and even iron - and still his wife refuse to have relation as often as he desire them . 
one wife , describe by a new_york psychologist , so dominate her husband that she actually placed their sexual_relationship on a schedule , write_down it down right between the weekly group meeting and the thursday night neighborhood card party . 
another put sex on a dollar and cent basis . 
after every money argument , she rebuff her husband 's overture until the matter was settle in her favor . 
expert say the partner in marriage like these can almost be type . 
the wife be likely to be young , sophisticated , smart_as_a_whip - often a girl who has sacrifice a promising career for marriage . 
she know the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband . 
the husband be usually a well-educated professional , preoccupy with his job - often an organization man whose motto for get_ahead be : `` do n't rock_the_boat '' . 
sometimes this lead to his become demandingly dominant in marriage . 
hem_in on the job and unable to assert_oneself himself , he use the sex_act so he can be supreme in at_least one area . 
more often , though , he be so accustomed to submit to authority on the job without argument that he live by the same rule at home . 
some psychologist , in_fact , suggest that career bound husband often be more to blame for topsy-turvy marriage than their wife . 
the wife 's attempt at control , these psychologist contend , be sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job . 
naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative . 
unless her husband also desire sex , the act cannot be consummate . 
generally , however , in such marriage as those cite , the husband be at his wife 's mercy . 
`` the pattern '' , say person , psychologist at new_york 's group , `` be for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly , virtually tremble in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight be the night '' . 
no one seriously contend , of_course , that the domineer wife be , sexually speak , a new character in our world . 
after_all , the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife be a comic figure of long standing , in literature and on the stage , as person point_out . 
there be no evidence that these milquetoast become suddenly emboldened when they cross the threshold of the master_bedroom . 
furthermore , person say , a certain number of docile , retiring man always have be around . 
they be n't `` frigid '' and they be n't homosexual ; they 're just restrained in all of life . 
they like to be dominate . 
one such man once confide to person , new_york psychiatrist , that he prefer to have his wife the sexual aggressor . 
ask why , he reply primly : 
`` because that 's no activity for a gentleman '' . 
but such case be , in the past , unusual . 
society here and abroad has been build around the dominating male - even the bible appear to endorse the concept . 
family survival on our own western frontier , for_example , could quite literally depend_on a man 's strength and ability to bring_home_the_bacon ; and the dependent wife seldom question his judgment about anything , include the marriage bed . 
this carry_over into the more urbanized late 19 th and early 20 th century , when the man rule the roost in the best bull_roaring life_with_father manner . 
in those day , a wife have mighty few right in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere . 
`` grandma was n't expect to like it '' , person , the late toronto gynecologist , once sum_up the attitude of the ' 90 s . 
wife of the period shamefacedly think_of themselves as `` used '' by their husband - and , history indicate , they often quite literally were . 
when be the turning_point ? 
when did woman begin to assert_oneself themselves sexually ? 
some date it from woman suffrage , others from when woman first begin to challenge man in the marketplace , still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub_gin . 
virtually everyone agree , however , that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerate with the postwar rush to the suburb . 
leave alone while her husband be mile away in the city , the modern wife assume more and more duty normally reserve for the male . 
circumstances give her almost undisputed sway over child rearing , money handling and home maintenance . 
she find she could cope_with all kind of problem for which she was once consider too helpless . 
she like this taste of authority and independence , and , with darkness , was not likely to give_up it up . 
`` very few wife '' , say person , `` who balance the checkbook , fix the car , choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesman , are suddenly going_to become submissive where sex is concern . 
a woman who dominate other family affairs will dominate the sexual_relationship as_well '' . 
and an additional factor was help to make woman more sexually self-assertive - the comparatively recent discovery of the true depth of female desire and response . 
marriage manual and woman 's magazine_article begin to stress the importance of the female climax . 
they begin to describe in_detail the woman 's capacity for response . 
in_fact , the noted psychologist and sex researcher , person , has declare flatly that woman be `` sexually superior '' to man . 
according to person , the average 20 - year old american woman be capable of far greater sexual_arousal than her partner . 
not surprisingly , person say , some recently enlightened wife be out_to claim these capability . 
yet , paradoxically , according to person , many wife despise their husband for not stand_up to them . 
an aggressive woman want a man to demand , not knuckle_under . 
`` when the husband become passive in_the_face_of his wife 's aggressiveness '' , person say , `` the wife , in_turn , find him inadequate . 
often she fail to gain sexual satisfaction '' . 
one such wife , person say , become disgusted with her weak husband and flurry through a series of extramarital affair in the hope of find a strong man . 
but her personality be such_that each affair last only until that lover , too , had been conquer and reduce to passivity . 
then the wife bed_hop to the next on the list . 
in some case , however , domination of the sex_act by one partner can be temporary , trigger by a passing but urgent emotional need . 
thus a man who is butting_a_stone_wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed - the one place he can still be champion . 
if his on_the_job problem work_out , he may return to his old pattern . 
sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep_over a man - or his wife - because he or she feel age creep_up . 
on_the_other_hand , a husband who always has be vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive - ask , psychologist say , for reassurance that his wife still find him desirable . 
or a wife may make sudden demand that she be court , flatter or coax , simply because she need her ego lift . 
in_any_case , person remark , such problem be a couple 's own affair , and can n't always be measure by a general yardstick . 
`` as_long_as the couple be in_agreement in their approach to sex , it make little difference if one or the other dominate '' , person declare . 
`` the important point be that both be satisfied with the adjustment '' . 
other expert say , however , that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exist for longer than a brief period , it be likely to shake the marriage . 
and just as domination today often begin with the wife , so the cure generally must lie with the husband . 
`` to get a marriage back where it belong '' , comment person of the group , `` the husband must take some very basic step . 
he must begin , paradoxically , by become more selfish . 
he must become more expressive of his own desire , more demanding and less ' understanding '' ' . 
too many husband , person continue , worry about `` how well they 're do '' , and fear that their success depend_on some trick or technique of sexual play . 
farming be confining . 
the farmer 's life must be arrange to meet the demand of crop and livestock . 
livestock must be tend every_day , routinely . 
a slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cow or chicken . 
even if there be no livestock , the farmer cannot leave the farm for long period , particularly during the growing_season . 
the worker who live on a farm cannot change job readily . 
he cannot leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice ; such a move may mean a loss of capital . 
hard physical labor and undesirable hours be a part of farm life . 
the farmer must get_up early , and , at_times , work late at night . 
frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain . 
no_matter how well work is plan , bad_weather or unexpected setback can cause extra work that must be catch_up . 
it may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the laborsaving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably . 
production may fall far below expectation . 
drought , hail , disease , and insect take their toll of crop . 
sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner 's earnings , even into his capital . 
return for money and labor invest may be small even in a good year . 
the high cost of land , supplies , and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis . 
land within commute distance of a growing city be usually high in price , high if it have subdivision possibility . 
part-time farmer generally must pay high price for supplies than full-time farmer because they buy in small quantity . 
if the farm be in an industrial area where wage be high , farm labor cost will also be high . 
a part-time farmer need unusual skill to get as high production per hen , per cow , or per acre as can be obtain by a competent full-time farmer . 
it will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment . 
he may have_to depend_on custom service for specialized operation , such_as spraying or threshing , and for these , he may have_to wait his turn . 
there will be loss cause by emergency that arise while he be away at his off farm job . 
the farm may be an additional burden if the main job is lose . 
this may be true whether the farm is own or rent . 
if the farm is rent , the rent must be pay . 
if it is own , tax must be pay , and if the place be not free_of mortgage , there will be interest and payment on the principal to take_care of . 
a farm provide a wholesome and healthful environment for child . 
it give them room to play and plenty of fresh air . 
the child can do chore adapt to their age and ability . 
care for a calf , a pig , or some chicken develop in child a sense_of_responsibility for work . 
part-time farming give a measure of security if the regular job is lose , provide the farm is own free_of debt and furnish enough income to meet fixed expense and minimum live cost . 
for some retired_person , part-time farming be a good way to supplement retirement income . 
it be particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out_of_doors for their health . 
generally , the same level of living cost less in the country than in the city . 
the saving be not as great , however , as is sometime suppose . 
usually , the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and utility somewhat more . 
where school , fire and police protection , and similar municipal services be of equal quality in city and country , real_estate tax be usually about the same . 
a part-time farmer and his family can use their spare_time profitably . 
some person consider the work on a farm recreational . 
for some white-collar worker it be a welcome change from the regular job , and a physical conditioner . 
part-time farming can take comparatively little land , labor , and equipment - or a great_deal . 
it depend_on the kind and the scale of the farming operation . 
general requirement for land , labor , and equipment are discuss below . 
specific requirement for each of various type of enterprise are discuss on page 8 to 14 . 
three quarter to 1 acre of good land be enough for raise fruit and vegetable for home use , and for a small flock of chicken , a cow , and two pig . 
you could not , of_course , raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small . 
if you want_to raise feed or carry_out some enterprise on a larger scale , you 'll need more land . 
in decide how much land you want , take_into_account the amount you 'll need to bring_in the income you expect . 
but consider also how much you and your family can keep_up along with your other work . 
the cost of land and the prospect for appreciation in value may influence your decision . 
some part-time farmer buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development . 
this be a highly speculative venture . 
sometimes a desired acreage is offer only as part of a larger tract . 
when surplus land be not expensive to buy or to keep_up , it be usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining property might impair the residential value of the farm . 
if you have a year-round , full-time job you can n't expect to grow much more than your family use - unless other member of the family do a good_deal of the work or you hire help . 
as a rule , part-time farmer hire little help . 
in decide on the enterprise to be manage by family labor , compare the amount of labor that can be supply by the family with the labor need of various enterprise list in table 1 . 
list the number of hour the family can be expect to work each_month . 
you may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one . 
do not include all your spare_time or all your family 's spare_time - only what you be willing to use for farm work . 
if you are going_to produce for home use only , you will need only hand_tool . 
you will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing , however . 
for larger planting , you 'll need some kind of power for plow , harrow , disk , and cultivate . 
if you have a planting of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor ( available for $ 300 to $ 500 with attachment , 1960 price ) . 
these tractor be not entirely satisfactory for plow , particularly on heavy soil , so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing . 
cost of power and machinery be often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer . 
if you are going_to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investment when you choose among farm enterprise . 
you can keep_down your machinery investment down by buy good secondhand machinery , by share the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor , and by hire someone with machinery to do certain job . 
if an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is need - such_as a spray rig , a combine , or a binder - it be better to pay someone with a machine to do the work . 
before you look_for a farm you 'll need_to know ( 1 ) the kind and scale of farming you want_to undertake ; and ( 2 ) whether you want_to buy or rent . 
information on page 8 to 14 may help you in decide on the kind and scale of your farming venture . 
if you be not well acquainted_with the area in which you wish_to locate , or if you be not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming , usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy . 
discuss below be some of the main thing to look_for when you select a part-time farm . 
choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunity . 
then if you change job you won n't necessarily have_to sell the farm . 
the presence of alternative job opportunity also will make the place easy to sell if that should become desirable . 
obviously the farm should be on an all weather road . 
if you grow anything to sell you will need market nearby . 
if you plan to sell fresh vegetable or whole milk , for_example , you should be close to a town or city . 
look_for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept home . 
there be slum in the country as_well as in the city . 
few rural_area are protect by zoning . 
a tavern , filling_station , junkyard , render plant , or some other business may go_up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value . 
check on the school in the area , the quality of teaching , and the provision for transportation to and from them . 
find_out whether fire protection , sewage_system , gas , water_main , and electrical line be available in the locality . 
if these facility be not at the door , get them may cost more_than you expect . 
you may have_to provide them yourself or get_along without them . 
you cannot get_along without an adequate supply of pure water . 
if you are consider a part-time farm where the water must be provide by a well , find_out if there be a good well on the farm or the probable cost of having one drill . 
a pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden . 
pond water can be filter for human use , but most part-time farmer would not want to go to so_much trouble . 
the following amount of water are need per day for livestock and domestic use . 
is the land suit to the crop you intend to raise ? 
if you can n't tell , get help from your county agricultural_agent or other local specialist . 
soil type , drainage , or degree of slope can make the difference between good crop and poor ones . 
small area that be n't right for a certain crop may lie next to area that be well suited to that crop . 
will the house on any part-time farm you are consider make a satisfactory full-time residence ? 
how much will it cost to do any necessary modernize and redecorate ? 
if the house be not wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central_heating system must be instal , check_into the cost of make these improvement . 
its worth as a place to live . 
the value of the product you can raise on it . 
the possibility of sell the property later_on for suburban subdivision . 
decide first what the place be worth to you and your family as a home in comparison with what it would cost to live in town . 
take_into_account the difference in city and county tax , insurance rate , utility rate , and the cost of travel to work . 
next , estimate the value of possible earnings of the farm . 
to do this , set_up a plan on_paper for operate the farm . 
list the kind and quantity of things the farm can be expect to produce in an average year . 
estimate the value of the produce at normal price . 
the total be the probable gross income from farming . 
to find estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming expenditure from probable gross income from farming . 
include as expenditure an allowance for depreciation of farm_building and equipment . 
also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contribute by the family . 
it may be hard to decide what this labor be worth , but charge something for it . 
otherwise , you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor . 
to figure the value of the farm in_terms_of investment income , divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invest in some other way . 
everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had_to be give his day in court as in some vast collective dirge . 
for almost two month , the defendant and the world hear from individual escape from the grave about father and mother , graybeard , adolescent , baby , starve , beat to death , strangle , machine_gun , gas , burn . 
one who had be a boy in location had_to tell how child had been select by height for the gas_chamber . 
the gruesome humor of the nazi was not forget - the gas_chamber with a sign on it with the name of a jewish foundation and bear a copper star_of_david - nor the gratuitous sadism of group officer . 
public_relations strategist everywhere , watch the reaction of the german press , the liberal press , the lunatic fringe press , listen to their neighbor , study interview with man and woman on the street , cry_out : too_much , too_much - the mind of the audience is become dulled , the horror are lose their effect . 
and still another witness , one who had crawl out from under a heap of corpse , had_to tell how the victim had been force to lie themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shoot . 
most_of this testimony may have be legally admissible as bear_on the corpus_delicti of the total nazi crime but seem subject_to question when not tie to the part in it of the defendant 's group . 
counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allow himself to be sweep by the current of dreadful recollection , rarely raise an objection . 
would not the emotional catharsis eventually bring_on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client 's chance ? 
those who fear `` emotionalism '' at the trial show less understanding than person of the route by which man achieve the distance necessary for fairness toward enemy . 
interruption come largely from the bench , which numerous time rebuke the attorney_general for let his witness run on , though it , too , make no serious effort to choke_off the flow . 
but there be a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the trial in jerusalem and those in moscow and new_york . 
in each of the last , the trial mark the beginning of a new course : in moscow the liquidation of the old bolshevik and the tightening of stalin 's dictatorship ; in the united_states the initiation of militant anti communism , with the repentant ex communist in the vanguard . 
these trial were properly term `` political case '' in_that the trial itself be a political act produce political consequence . 
but what could the person trial initiate ? 
of what new course could it mark the beginning ? 
the person case look_to the past , not to the future . 
it be the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection , and of refine the recollection , that will last as_long_as there be jew . 
as_such , it be beyond politics and have no need of justification by a `` message '' . 
`` it be not an individual that be in the dock at this historical trial '' - say person , `` and not the nazi regime alone - but anti-semitism throughout history '' . 
how could supply person with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of jew without be an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-semitism ? 
and if it be not an individual who be in the dock , why be the trial , as we shall observe later , all_but scuttle in the attempt to prove person a `` fiend '' ? 
these question touch the root of confusion in the prosecution 's case . 
it might be contend , of_course , that person in stubbornly deny anti-semitic feeling was lie or insist on a private definition of anti-semitism . 
but in either event he be the wrong man for the kind of case outline by person and set_forth in the indictment . 
in such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have_to be tie to the issue by argument . 
one who could be link to anti-semitism only by overcome his objection be scarcely a good specimen of the jew-baiter throughout the age . 
shout at person though he might , the prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsify the way he feel about jews or that what he did feel fall_into the generally recognized category of anti-semitism . 
yes , he believe that the jew be `` enemy of the reich '' , and such a belief be , of_course , typical of `` patriotic '' anti-semite ; but he believe in the jew as enemy in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a member of a cult speculate on the nature of thing . 
the real question be how one pass from anti-semitism of_this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be find in anti-semitism itself . 
in regard_to person , it was to be find in the nazi outlook , which contain a principle separate from and far worse than anti-semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-semitism itself was make more virulent . 
perhaps under the guidance of_this nazi principle one could , as person declare , feel personally friendly toward the jew and still be their murderer . 
not through fear of disobey order , as person keep try to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that begin in a half acceptance of the vicious absurdity contain in the nazi interpretation of history and grow with each of hitler 's victory into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that be able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , `` well , let 's try it '' . 
at_any_rate , the substance of person 's testimony be that all his action flow_from his membership in the party and the group , and though the prosecutor do his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of jew , his success on this score be doubtful and the anti-semitic lesson weakened to_that_extent . 
but if the trial did not expose the special nazi mania so deadly to jew as_well_as to anyone upon whom it happen to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-semitism of which the nazi make such effective use in germany and wherever else they could find it . 
if anti-semitism be on_trial in jerusalem , why was it not identify , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activity of person 's group , as exemplify by the betrayal and murder of jew by non police and nonparty anti-semite in germany , as_well_as in poland , czechoslovakia , hungary ? 
the infamous wansee_conference call by person in january 1942 , to organize the material and technical means to put_to_death the eleven million jew spread throughout the nation of europe , was attend by representative of major organ of the german state , include the person , the person in_charge of the four_year_plan , the person , the person . 
the measure for annihilation propose and accept at the conference affect industry , transportation , civilian agency of government . 
person , in open the conference , follow the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issue earlier by person which authorize the final_solution as `` a complement to '' previous `` solution '' for eliminate the jew from german living_space through violence , economic_strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation . 
in_other_words , the promulgator of the murder plan make clear that physically exterminate the jew be but an extension of the anti-semitic measure already operate in every phase of german life , and that the new conspiracy count_on the general anti-semitism that had make those measure effective , as a readiness for murder . 
this , in_fact , it turn_out to be . 
since the magnitude of the plan make secrecy impossible , once the wheels had begin to turn , person control german industry , social institution , and armed_forces become , through their anti-semitism or their tolerance of_it , conscious accomplice of hitler 's crime ; whether in the last degree or a lesser one be a matter to be determine individually . 
what more could be ask for a trial intend to warn the world against anti-semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable anti-semite and the concentration_camp brute ? 
not in person 's anti-semitism but in the anti-semitism of the sober german man_of_affairs lie the potential warning of the trial . 
no_doubt many_of the citizen of the third_reich had conceive their anti-semitism as an `` innocent '' dislike of jew , as do others like them today . 
the final_solution prove that the jew-baiter of any variety expose himself as be implicated in the criminality and madness of others . 
ought not an edifying trial have make every effort to demonstrate this once_and_for_all by show how representative type of `` mere '' anti-semite were draw step_by_step into the program of skull bash and gassing ? 
the prosecutor in his opening remark did refer to `` the germ of anti-semitism '' among the german which hitler `` stimulate and transform '' . 
but if there be evidence at the trial that aim over person 's head at his collaborator in the society where he function , the press seem to have miss it . 
nor did the trial devote much attention to expose the usefulness of anti-semitism to the nazi , both in build their own power and in destroy that of rival organization and state . 
certainly , one of the best way of warn the world against anti-semitism be to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon . 
person himself be a model of how the myth of the enemy jew can be use to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbor . 
do patriot everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the jew in germany and later in the occupied country contribute to terrorize the population , split apart individual and group , arouse the mean and most dishonest impulse , pulverize trust and personal dignity , and finally force people to follow their master into the abyss by make them partner in unspeakable crime ? 
the career of person make the trial a potential showcase for anti-semitic demoralization : 
fearful of being mistake for a jew , he seek protection in his nazi uniform ; cling to the enemy jew idea , he is force to overcome habit of politeness and neighborliness ; once in power he begin to give_vent to a criminal opportunism that cause him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him . 
`` is this the type of citizen you desire '' ? the trial should have ask the nation . 
but though this characterization in_no_way diminish person 's guilt , the prosecutor , more deeply involve in the tactic of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of_it . 
finally , if the mission of the trial be to convict anti-semitism , how could it have fail to post before the world the contrasting fate of the country in which the final_solution was aid by native jew hater - i.e. , germany , poland , hungary , czechoslovakia - and those in which it meet the obstacle of human solidarity - denmark , holland , italy , bulgaria , france ? 
should not everyone have been awaken to_it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nation poison by anti-semitism prove less fortunate in regard_to their own freedom than those whose citizen save their jewish compatriot from the transport ? 
was n't this meaning of person 's experience in various country worth highlight ? 
as the first collective confrontation of the nazi outrage , the trial of person represent a recovery of the jew from the shock of the death camp , a recovery that take fifteen year and which be still by_no_means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hasten by silence ) . 
only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin . 
it be already difficult to recall how little we know before the trial of what had been done to the jew of europe . 
it be not that the fact of the persecution be unavailable ; most_of the information elicit in jerusalem had been bring to the surface by the numerous war_crime tribunal and investigating commission , and by report , memoir , and survivor ' account . 
in location , location , in 1952 , a roman_catholic hospital present seven protestant physician with an ultimatum to quit the group or to resign from the hospital staff . 
three agree , but four decline and were suspend . 
after a flood of protest , they were reinstate at the beginning of 1953 . 
the peace of the community was badly disturb , and people across_the_nation , read of the incident , feel uneasy . 
in new_york_city in 1958 , the city 's commissioner of hospital refuse to permit a physician to provide a protestant mother with a contraceptive_device . 
he thereby precipitate a bitter controversy involve protestant , jew and roman_catholic that continue for two month , until the city 's board of hospital lift the ban on birth_control therapy . 
a year later in albany , location , a roman_catholic hospital bar an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the group . 
immediately , the religious group of the city were embroil in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man 's right to freedom of religious_belief and conscience . 
these incident , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decade has cause more tension , rancor and strife among religious group in this country than the birth_control issue . 
it has flare_up periodically on the front page of newspaper in community divided over birth prevention regulation in municipal hospital and health and family welfare agency . 
it has erupt on the national level in the matter of include birth_control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped country . 
where it is not actually erupt , it rumble and smolder in sullen resentment like a volcano , ready to explode at any moment . 
the time has come for citizen of all faith to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation . 
the first_step toward the goal be the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good_will and friendly communication on other_than the polemical level . 
instead of emotional recrimination , loaded phrase and sloganeering , we need a dispassionate study of the fact , a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the area of agreement until a solution is reach . 
`` all_too frequently '' , point_out person , managing_editor of commonweal , `` catholic run_roughshod over protestant sensibility in this matter , by failure to consider the reasoning behind the protestant position and , particularly , by their jibe at the fact that protestant opinion on birth_control has change in recent decade '' . 
all_too often our language be unduly harsh . 
the second step be to recognize the substantial agreement - frequently blur by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting - already exist between catholic and non-catholic concern the overall objective of family_planning . 
instead of catholic ' be obliged or even encourage to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many non-catholic imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stress . 
family_planning is encourage , so that parent will be able to provide properly for their offspring . 
person , declare in 1951 that it be possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long_time and even for the whole duration of married life , if there be serious reason , such_as those often mention in the so-called medical , eugenic , economic and social `` indication '' . 
this mean that such factor as the health of the parent , particularly the mother , their ability to provide their child with the necessity of life , the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facility may legitimately be take into consideration in determine the number of offspring . 
these be substantially the same factor consider by non-catholic in family_planning . 
the law of many state permit birth_control only for medical reason . 
the roman_catholic_church , however , sanction a much more liberal policy on family_planning . 
catholic , protestant and jew be in_agreement over the objective of family_planning , but disagree over the method to be use . 
the roman_catholic_church sanction only abstention or the rhythm_method , also_known_as the use of the infertile or safe period . 
the roman_catholic_church consider this to be the method provide by nature and its divine author : it involve no frustration of nature 's law , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them . 
with the exception of the roman_catholic_church and the orthodox_catholic_church , most church make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptive , allow the couple free choice . 
here be a difference in theological belief where there seem little chance of agreement . 
the ground for the roman_catholic_church 's position be scriptural ( old_testament ) , the teaching of the father and doctor of the early roman_catholic_church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen century , the decision of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural_law . 
the latter play a prominent role in roman_catholic theology and is consider decisive , entirely apart from scripture , in determine the ethical character of birth_prevention method . 
the roman_catholic natural_law tradition regard as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act be procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouse be the secondary and subjective end . 
this conclusion is base on two proposition : that man by the use of his reason can ascertain god 's purpose in the universe and that god make known his purpose by certain `` given '' physical arrangement . 
thus , man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act be procreation , the propagation of the human_race . 
moreover , man may_not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangement establish by god , who through the law of rhythm has provide a natural method for the control of conception . 
believe that god be the author of this law and of all law_of_nature , roman_catholic believe that they be obliged to obey those law , not frustrate or mock them . 
let it be granted then that the theological difference in this area between protestant and roman_catholic appear to be irreconcilable . 
but people differ in their religious_belief on scores of doctrine , without take_up_arms against those who disagree with them . 
why be it so different in regard_to birth_control ? 
it be because each side has seek to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief , or at_least the practical consequence thereof , upon others . 
it be always a temptation for a religious organization , especially a powerful or dominant one , to impose through the clenched_fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others . 
both roman_catholic and protestant have succumb to this temptation in the past . 
consider what happen during world_war_1 , , when the protestant church unite to push the prohibition law through congress . 
many_of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree be intrinsically evil and sinful . 
with over four million american man away at war , protestant force their distinctive theological belief upon the general public . 
with the return of our soldier , it soon become apparent that the belief was not share by the great majority of citizen . 
the attempt to enforce that belief usher_in a reign of bootlegger , racketeer , hijacker and gangster that lead to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history . 
the so-called `` noble experiment '' come to an inglorious end . 
that tumultuous , painful and costly experience show clearly that a law express a moral judgment cannot be enforce when it have little correspondence with the general view of society . 
that experience hold a lesson for us all in regard_to birth_control today . 
up_to the turn_of_the_century , contraception was condemn by all christian_church as immoral , unnatural and contrary to divine_law . 
this was generally reflect in the civil_law of christian country . 
today , the roman_catholic_church and orthodox_church stand virtually alone in hold that conviction . 
the various lambeth_conferences , express the anglican viewpoint , mirror the gradual change that has take_place among protestant generally . 
in 1920 , the lambeth_conference repeat its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issue `` an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together_with the grave danger - physical , moral , and religious - thereby incur , and against the evil which the extension of such use threaten the human_race '' . 
denounce the view that the sexual_union be an end in itself , the conference declare : `` we steadfastly uphold what must always be regard_as the governing consideration of christian marriage . 
one be the primary purpose for which marriage exist , namely , the continuance of the human_race through the gift and heritage of child ; the other be the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control '' . 
the conference call_for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptive . 
in 1930 , the lambeth_conference again affirm the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of child , but concede that , in certain limited circumstance , contraception might be morally legitimate . 
in 1958 , the conference endorse birth_control as the responsibility lay by god on parent everywhere . 
many other protestant_denomination precede the anglican in such action . 
in march , 1931 , 22 out of 28 member of a committee of the group ratify artificial method of birth_control . 
`` as_to the necessity '' , the committee declare , `` for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of child , and consequently of control of conception , there can be no question . 
there be general_agreement also that sex union between husband and wife as an expression of mutual_affection without relation_to procreation be right '' . 
since then , many protestant_denomination have made separate pronouncement , in which they not_only approve birth_control , but declare it at_times to be a religious duty . 
what determine the morality , they state , be not the means use , but the motive . 
in_general , the means ( exclude abortion ) that prove most effective are consider the most ethical . 
this development is reflect in the action take in february , 1961 , by the general board of the group , the largest protestant organization in the us . 
the board approve and commend the use of birth_control device as a part of christian responsibility in family_planning . 
it call_for opposition to law and institutional practice restrict the information or availability of contraceptive . 
the general board declare : `` most_of the protestant church hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motive be right . 
the general protestant conviction be that motive , rather than method , form the primary moral issue , provided the method are limit to the prevention of conception '' . 
an action once universally condemn by all christian_church and forbid by the civil_law is now not_only approve by the overwhelming majority of protestant_denomination , but also deem , at certain time , to be a positive religious duty . 
this viewpoint has now been translate into action by the majority of people in this country . 
repeated poll have disclose that most married_couple are now use contraceptive in the practice of birth_control . 
for all concerned with social_welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habit of the vast majority of the american people be clear , profound and far reach . 
to try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasion by the ill-starred prohibition experiment . 
this bring us to the fact that the reality we are deal with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : they be moral judgment and matter of theological belief . 
conscience and religion be concerned with private sin : the civil_law be concerned with public crime . 
only confusion , failure and anarchy result when the effort is make to impose upon the civil_authority the impossible task of police private home to preclude the possibility of sin . 
among the chief victim of such an ill-conceived imposition would be religion itself . 
on april 17th , 1610 , the sturdy little three masted bark , discovery , weigh_anchor in location , london , and float down the location toward_the_sea . 
she carry , besides her captain , a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the arctic water of north_america . 
seventeen month later , on september 6th , 1611 , an irish fishing_boat sight the discovery limp eastward outside location . 
when she reach port , she was find to have onboard only eight men , all near starvation . 
the captain be gone , and the mate was gone . 
the man who now command her had start the voyage as an ordinary seaman . 
what disaster strike the discovery during those seventeen month ? 
what happen to the fourteen missing men ? 
these question have remain one of the great sea mystery of_all_time . 
for hundred of year , the evidence available consist_of ( 1 ) the captain 's fragmentary journal , ( 2 ) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivor , ( 3 ) a note find in a dead man 's desk onboard , and ( 4 ) several secondhand report . 
all_told , they offer a highly confused picture . 
but since 1927 , researcher dig_into ancient court record and legal file have be able to find illuminating piece of information . 
not enough to do away with all doubt , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the event of the voyage . 
historian have have two reason for persist so long in their investigation . 
first , they want to clarify a tantalizing , bizarre enigma . 
second , they believe it important to determine the fate of the captain - a man whose name is permanently stamp on our map , on american town and county , on a great american river , and on half a_million square_mile of arctic sea . 
the name : person . 
this be the story of his last tragic voyage , as_nearly_as we be able - or ever , probably , will be able - to determine : 
the sailing in the spring of 1610 be person 's fourth in four year . 
each time his objective had be the same - a direct water passage from western europe to the far_east . 
in 1607 and 1608 , the english group had send him northward to look_for a route over the north_pole or across the top of russia . 
twice he had fail , and the group indicate it would not back him again . 
in 1609 , the group hire person , give him two learned geographer , fit_out him out with a ship called the half_moon , and supply him with dutch sailor . 
this time he turn westward , to the middle_atlantic coast of north_america . 
his chief discovery be important - the location ( later , the hudson ) river - but it produce no northwest passage . 
when the half_moon put in at location , england , in the fall of 1609 , word of person 's finding leak_out , and english interest in him revive . 
the government forbid person to return to amsterdam with his ship . 
he thereupon go to london and spend the winter talk to man of wealth . 
by springtime , he was support by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of person , prince_of_wales . 
he had obtain and provision a veteran ship called the discovery and had recruit a crew of twenty-one , the large he had ever command . 
the purpose of this fourth voyage be clear . 
a century of exploration had establish that a great landmass , north and south america , lie between europe and the_indies . 
one_by_one , the opening in the coast that promise a passage through had been explore and discard . 
in_fact , person 's sail up the great_north_river had dispose of one of the last hope . 
but there remain one mysterious , unexplored gap , far to_the_north . 
nearly twenty-five year before , person had note , as he sail near the arctic_circle , `` a very great gulf , the water whirl and roar , as_it_were the meeting of tide '' . 
he name this opening , between baffin_island and labrador , the `` location '' . 
( later , it was to be call location . ) 
in 1602 , person , in the same little discovery that person now command , had sail 300 mile up the strait before his frightened men turn the ship back . 
person now propose to sail all_the_way through and test the sea beyond for the long sought waterway . 
even person , experienced in arctic sailing and determined as he be , must have have qualm as he slide down the location . 
ahead be perilous , ice filled water . 
on previous voyage , it had be in precisely such dangerous situation that he had fail as a leader and captain . 
on the second voyage , he had turn_back at the frozen island of location and meekly give the crew a certificate state that he did so of his own free_will - which be obviously not the case . 
on the third voyage , a near mutiny rise from a quarrel between dutch and english crew_member on the half_moon had almost force him to head the ship back to amsterdam in middle atlantic . 
worse , his present crew include five man who had sail with him before . 
of only one could he be sure - young person , his second son . 
the mate , person , who had keep the journal on the half_moon , be experienced - but he be a bitter old_man , ready to complain or desert at any opportunity . 
person , the ship 's carpenter , be a good worker , but perversely independent . 
person and person be like the rest - lukewarm , ready to swing against person in a crisis . 
but man willing to sail at_all into water where wooden ship could be crush like eggs be hard to find . 
person know he have to use these man as_long_as he remain an explorer . 
and he refuse to be anything else . 
it is believe that person be related to other seafaring man of the group and was train on company ship . 
he be a londoner , married , with three son . 
( the common misconception that he be dutch and that his first_name be person stem from dutch document of his third voyage . ) 
in 1610 , person be probably in his early forties , a good navigator , a stubborn voyager , but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession . 
person 's first error of the fourth voyage occur only a_few mile down the location . 
there at the river 's edge wait one person , whom person list as a `` clerk '' . 
person be in actuality a young ruffian from kent , who had break_with his parent in_order to keep_company the company he prefer - pimp , pander and whore . 
he be not the sort of sailor person want his backer to see onboard and he had person wait at location , where the discovery pick_up him up . 
for the first three week , the ship skirt up the east coast of great_britain , then turn westward . 
on may 11th , she reach iceland . 
poor wind and fog lock_up her up in a harbor the crew call `` location '' . 
the subsequent two_weeks wait make the crew quarrelsome . 
with person look_on , his protege person pick a fight with the ship 's surgeon , person . 
the issue was settle onshore , person win and person remain ashore , determined to catch the next fishing_boat back to england . 
with difficulty , person persuade him to rejoin the ship , and they sail from iceland . 
early in june , the discovery pass `` location '' ( southern greenland ) and in mid-june enter the `` location '' . 
floating ice bear_down from the north and west . 
fog hang over the route constantly . 
turbulent tide rise as_much_as fifty foot . 
the ship 's compass be useless because of the nearness of the magnetic north_pole . 
as the berg grow large , person was force to turn south into what be now location , an inlet of the great strait . 
after find that its coast lead nowhere , however , he turn north again , toward the main , ice filled passageway - and the crew , at_first uneasy , then frightened , rebel . 
the trouble be at_least partly person 's doing . 
for week he had been say that person 's idea of sail through to java be absurd . 
the great , crushing ice mass come into view make him sound like the voice of pure reason . 
a group of sailor announce to person that they would sail no far . 
instead of quell the dissension , as many captain of the era would have do ( person lop_off a man 's head off under similar circumstance ) , person decide to be reasonable . 
he go_to his cabin and emerge carry a large chart , which he set_up in_view of the crew . 
patiently , he explain what he know about their course and their objective . 
when person had finish , the `` town_meeting '' break_down into a general , wordy argument . 
one man remark that if he have a_hundred pound , he would give ninety of them to be back in england . 
up speak carpenter person , who say he would n't give ten pound to be home . 
the statement be effective . 
the meeting break_up . 
person be free to sail on . 
all through july the discovery pick her way along the 450 - mile long strait , avoid ice and rocky island . 
on august 3rd , two massive headland rear out of the mist - great gateway never before , so_far as person know , see by european . 
to starboard be a cape a_thousand foot high , patch with ice and snow , populate by thousand of screaming sea_bird . 
to port be a point 200 foot high rise behind to a precipice of 2000 foot . 
person name the cape person and person , for two of his backer . 
person point the discovery down the east coast of the newly discovered sea ( now called hudson_bay ) , confident he be on_the_way to the warm water of the pacific . 
after three week ' swift sailing , however , the ship enter an area of shallow marsh and river delta . 
the ship halt . 
the great `` sea to the westwards '' be a dead_end . 
this must have be person 's black discovery . 
for he seem to sense at_once that before him be no south_sea , but the solid bulk of the north-american continent . 
this was the bitter_end , and person seem to know he was destine to failure . 
feverishly , he try to brush away this intuition . 
north and south , east and west , back_and_forth he sail in the landlocked bay , plow furiously forward until land appear , then turn to repeat the process , day_after_day , week_after_week . 
hundred of mile to_the_north , the route back to england through the `` location '' was again fill with ice . 
the men be at_first puzzle , then anger by the aimless tack . 
once_more , person 's complaint be the loud . 
person 's reply be to accuse the mate of disloyalty . 
person demand that person prove his charge in an open trial . 
the trial was hold september tenth . 
person , preside , hear person 's defense , then call_for testimony from crew_member . 
person had make plentiful enemy , several man step_forward . 
hand on bible , seaman person and carpenter person swear that person had try to persuade them to keep musket and sword in their cabin . 
person say person had predict bloodshed on the ship . 
others add that person had want to turn the ship homeward . 
person depose person and cut his pay . 
the new mate be person , talented but inexperienced . 
there be other shift and pay_cut according to the way individual had conduct themselves . 
the important result , however , be that person and person , the deposed boatswain , become person 's sworn enemy . 
as person resume his desperate crisscross of the little bay , every incident lessen the crew 's respect for him . 
once , after the discovery lie for a week in rough weather , person order the anchor raise before the sea had calm . 
just as it was being haul inboard , a sea hit the ship . 
person and person were throw off the capstan and badly injure . 
the anchor cable would have be lost overboard , but person be on_hand to sever it with his axe . 
person , fifth earl of location , a noble humanitarian scot concerned with the plight of the crofter of his native location , conceive a plan to settle them in the valley of the red_river of the north . 
since the land he desire lie within the great northern empire of the group , he purchase great block of the group stock with the view to control its policy . 
having achieve this end , he be able to buy 116000 square_mile in the valley of the red and location river . 
the grant , which stretch southward to location - the headwaters of the red - was make in may , 1811 , and by october of that year a small group of scot was settle for the winter at location on hudson_bay . 
thus at the same time that person was prepare to pacify the aborigine of location and win fame at the battle of location , anglo-saxon settlement make a great leap into the center of the north-american continent to the west of the american agricultural frontier . 
seven hundred mile south of location , at `` the location '' of the red and the location , twenty-three man locate a settlement in august 1812 . 
by october the little colony about location ( present-day winnipeg ) number 100 . 
within a_few year the scot , engage in break the thick sod and stir the rich soil of the valley , were join by a group called person . 
the latter , member of two regiment of swiss mercenary transport by great_britain to canada to fight the american in the war_of_1812 , had settle in montreal and location at the close of the war in 1815 . 
person persuade eighty man and four officer to go_to red_river where they were to serve as a military_force to protect his settler from the hostile group which resent the intrusion of farmer into the fur trader ' empire . 
the mercenary be little interested in farming and add nothing to the output of the farm plot on which all work be still do with hoe as late as 1818 . 
it was the low yield of the person plot and the ravage of grasshopper in 1818 that lead to the dispersal of the settlement southward . 
when late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assess , all but fifty of the scot , swiss and metis move up the red to the mouth of the location river . 
here they build hut and a stockade named location after person barony in scotland . 
the new site be somewhat warm than location and much close to the great herd of buffalo on which the settlement must depend_on for food . 
the person settler had been anticipate in their move southward by british fur trader . 
for many year the group have its southern headquarters at location on the mississippi_river , some 300 mile southeast of present-day st._paul , minnesota . 
when in 1816 an act of congress force the foreign firm out of the united_states , its british born employee , now become american citizen - person , person and person - continue in the fur business . 
on location near the headwaters of the red_river , person , superintendent of the western group of canada , have a trading_post and plan in 1818 to build a fort to be defend by twenty man and two small artillery piece . 
his trading goods come from canada to the fork of red_river and from person settlement he bring them south in cart . 
these cart be of a type devise in location in the day of person the younger about a decade before the person colony was begin . 
in 1802 person refer to `` our new cart '' as be about four foot off the ground and carry five times as much_as a horse could pack . 
they were hold together by peg and withe and in later time draw by a single ox in thill . 
it was person who suggest to person that he return to the atlantic coast by way of the united_states . 
in september 1817 at location ( location ) person meet the noble lord whom , with the help of a band of sioux , he escort to location . 
during the trip person decide that the route through illinois territory to indiana and the eastern united_states be the best route for goods from england to reach red_river and that the united_states be a better source of supply for many goods than either canada or england . 
upon arrive_at baltimore , person on december 22 write to person , secretary_of_state at washington , inquire about law cover trade with `` location and location '' . 
this traffic , he declare prophetically , `` tho ' it might be of small account at_first , would increase with the progress of our settlement '' . 
the route which he had travel and which he believe might develop_into a trade_route was follow by his settler earlier than he might have expect . 
in 1819 grasshopper again destroy the crop at `` the fork '' ( location ) and in december 1819 , twenty man leave location for the most northerly american outpost at location . 
it be a three month journey in the dead of winter follow by three month of labor on mackinac boat . 
with these completed and ice gone from the location ( present-day minnesota river ) their 250 bushel of wheat , 100 bushel of oat and barley and 30 bushel of pea and some chicken were load onto the flat-bottomed boat and row up the river to location , across into location , and down the red . 
they reach location in june 1820 . 
this epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost person 1040 . 
nevertheless so short be the supply of seed that the settler were force to retreat to location for food . 
thereafter seed and food become more plentiful and the colony remain in the north the year round . 
activity by british trader and the presence of a colony on the red prompt the united_states war_department in 1819 to send person from detroit to put a post 300 mile northwest of location , until then the most advanced united_states post . 
in september 1822 two company of infantry arrive_at the mouth of the location , the head of navigation on the mississippi , and begin construction of location which , upon completion , was rename in_honor_of its commander , person . 
it was from the american outpost that red_river shortage of livestock were to be make good . 
person , fur trader and merchant at location , contract to supply person 's people with some 300 head of cattle , and person and person were hire as drover . 
person , after leave location in august 1821 , was force to leave some of the cattle at the group post on location `` in the location '' and reach location , as the person group center was now called , late in the fall . 
he set_out on his 700 - mile return journey with five family of discontented and disappoint swiss who turn their eye toward the united_states . 
observe their distressing condition , person allow these half starved immigrant to settle on the military reservation . 
as these swiss were move from the person settlement to become the first civilian resident of minnesota , person of location , michigan , and location was travel_to red_river to open a trade in merchandise . 
early in 1822 he be at location offer to bring_in pork , flour , liquor and tobacco . 
person , governor of location , and person , a chief factor of the group , order such `` sundry article '' to a value of 4500 . 
for its part the group was trouble by the approach of american settlement . 
as the time draw_near for the draw of the british american frontier by term of the agreement of 1818 , the company suspect that the group - its own post and group - be on american territory . 
accordingly person 's agent order the settler to move north , and by october , person had tear_down both post , float the timber to `` the location '' in raft . 
`` i have do everything '' , he write , `` to break_up the whole of that unfortunate establishment '' . 
despite group threat , duly carry_through , to cut_off supplies of powder , ball , and thread for fishing_net , about 350 person stay in the village . 
they would attempt to bring supplies from st._louis or location at `` great expense as well as danger '' . 
at location some of the_swiss also decide to cast their lot with the united_states , and in 1823 several family pay guide to take them to location . 
the disaster of 1825 - 1826 cause more to leave . 
after heavy rain and an onslaught of mouse , snow fall on october 15th , 1825 , and remain on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the red be five foot thick . 
in april come a rapid thaw that produce high water which did not recede until mid-june . 
on june 24th more than 400 family start the three month trip across the plain to the mississippi . 
by fall , 443 survivor of this arduous journey were cluster about location , but most_of them were send_on to location and st._louis , with a few go as far as location , indiana , a notable swiss center in the united_states . 
in 1837 , 157 red_river people with more than 200 cattle were live on the reservation at location . 
below the fort , high bluff extend uninterruptedly for six mile along the mississippi_river . 
at the point where they end , another settlement grow up around a chapel build at the boat landing by person in 1840 . 
its people , include person and other group employee and the refugee from location , were join by the remaining scot and swiss from location when person expel them from the reservation in may 1840 . 
the resultant town , plat in 1847 and name for the patron_saint of person 's mission , person , was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take_on a new interest for those selkirkers who remain at red_river . 
while population at location increase rapidly , from 2417 in 1831 to 4369 in 1840 , economic opportunity did not increase at a similar rate . 
accordingly , though the practice violate the no trade provision of the person charter which reserve all such activity in merchandise and fur to the group , some settler go into trade . 
the group maintain a store at which product of england could be purchase and bring_in goods for the new merchant on the understanding that they refrain_from trade in fur . 
despite this prohibition , by 1844 some of the location merchant were trade with the indian for fur . 
in june 1845 , the governor and council of location impose a 20 percent duty on import via location which were view_as aim at the `` very vitals of the group 's trade and power '' . 
to reduce further the flow of goods from england , the group 's local official ask that its london authorities refrain_from forwarding any more trade goods to these man . 
with their customary source of supply cut_off , the location free_trader engage three man to cart goods to them from the mississippi country . 
others carry pemmican from `` the location '' to st._paul and goods from st._paul to red_river , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , person , transport twenty barrel of whisky to the british settlement . 
this trade be subject to a tariff of 7.5 percent after february 1835 , but much was smuggle into location with the result that the duty was reduce by 1841 to 4 percent on the initiative of the london committee . 
the trade in a_few commodity note above was to grow in volume as a result of change both north and south of the 49 th parallel . 
the letter of the common_soldier be rich_in humor . 
indeed , no rich humor is to be find in the whole of american literature than in the letter of the semiliterate man who wear the blue and the gray . 
some of their figure_of_speech be colorful and expressive . 
a confederate observe that the yankee be : `` thick than louse on a hen and a dam site ornraier '' . 
another report that his comrade be `` in fine spirit pitch around like a blind dog in a meat_house '' . 
a third write that it was `` rain like pour pea on a rawhide '' . 
yank be equally adept at figurative expression . 
one write : `` [ i be so hungry ] i could eat a rider off his horse + snap_at the stirrup '' . 
a second report that the dilapidated house in virginia `` look_like the latter end of original_sin and hard_times '' . 
a third remark of slowness of southerner : `` they move about from corner to corner , as uneasy as a litter of hungry leech on the neck of a wooden god '' . 
still another , annoyed by the brevity of a recently receive missive , write : `` yore letter be short_and_sweet , jist like a roasted maggot '' . 
a yankee sergeant give the following description of his sweetheart : `` my girl be none of your one-horse girl . 
she be a regular stub_and_twister , double_geered . 
she be well-educated and refined , all wildcat and fur , and union from the muzzle to the crupper '' . 
humor find many mode of expression . 
a texan write to a male companion at home : `` what has become of person and person ? 
when you see them again give them my love - not best respects now , but love by god '' . 
person , an admirable georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserve in the group , like to tease his wife in his letter . 
after he had be away from home about a year he write : `` [ dear wife ] if i did not write and receive letter from you i believe that i would forget that i be married i do n't feel much like a married man but i never forget it sofar_as to court enny other lady but if i should you must forgive me as i be so forgetful '' . 
a yank , disturb by his increasing corpulence , write : `` i am grow so fat i be a burden 2 myself '' . 
another yank parody the familiar bedtime prayer : 
`` now i lie_down me down to sleep , the grayback o ' er my body creep ; if they should bite before i wake , i pray the lord their jaw to break '' `` . 
person , a splendid georgia soldier , differ from most_of his comrade in the rank in that he be the owner of a large plantation , well-educated , and nearly fifty year of_age . 
but he be very_much_like his associate in his hatred of camp routine . 
near the end of his service he write that when the war be over he was going to buy two pup , name one of them `` fall-in '' and the other `` close-up '' , and_then shoot them both , `` and that will be the end of ' fall-in ' and ' close-up '' ' . 
the soldier who comprise the rank_and_file of the civil_war army be an earthy people . 
they talk and write much about the elemental bodily_function of the body . 
one of the most common of camp malady be diarrhoea . 
man of more delicate sensibility refer to this condition as `` looseness_of_the_bowels '' ; but a much more common designation be `` the_shits '' . 
a michigan soldier station in georgia write in 1864 : `` i expect to be tough as a knot as_soon_as i get_over the georgia the_shits '' . 
johnny_reb from the deep_south who were plague with diarrhoea after transfer to the virginia front often inform their family that they were suffer from the `` the virginia quickstep '' . 
a georgia soldier give his wife the following description of the cause and consequence of diarrhoea : `` i have be a_little sick with diarrhea two or three day . 
i eat too_much eggs and pork it sour [ on ] my stomach and turn loose on me '' . 
a michigan soldier write his brother : `` i be well at_present with the exception i have get the diarrhea and i hope thease few line find you the same '' . 
the letter which pour forth from camp were usually write under adverse circumstance . 
save for brief period in garrison or winter quarters , soldier rarely enjoy the luxury of a writing_desk or table . 
most_of the letter were write in the hubbub of camp , on stump , piece of bark , drumhead , or the knee . 
in the south , after the first year of the war , paper and ink be very poor . 
scarcity of paper cause many southerner to adopt the practice of cross writing , i.e. , after write from left to right of the page in the usual manner , they give the sheet a half turn and write from end to end across the line previously written . 
sometimes soldier write letter while bullet were whiz about their head . 
a yank write from location , may twenty-eighth , 1863 , state `` not less_than 50 ball have pass_over me since i commence write . 
i could tell you of plenty narrow_escape , but we take no notice of them now '' . 
a reb station near location inform his mother : `` i need not tell you that i dodge pretty often , for you can see that very plainly by the blot in this letter . 
just count each blot a dodge and add in a_few for i do n't dodge every time '' . 
another reb write under similar circumstance before atlanta report : `` the yankee keep shoot so i be afraid they will knock_over my ink , so i will close '' . 
the most common type of letter be that of soldier husband to their wife . 
but father often address communication to their small child ; and these , full of homely advice , be among the most human and revealing of civil_war letter . 
reb who own slave occasionally would include in their letter admonition or greeting to member of the negro community . 
occasionally they would write to the slave . 
early in the war it be not uncommon for planter ' son to retain in camp negro `` body_servant '' to perform the menial chore such_as cooking , foraging , cleaning the quarters , shining shoe , and laundering clothes . 
sometimes these servant write or dictate for enclosure with the letter of their soldier master message to their relative and to member of their owner ' family . 
unmarried soldier carry_on correspondence with sweetheart at home . 
owing to the restrained usage characteristic of 19th century america , these letter usually be stereotyped and reveal little depth of feeling . 
occasionally gay young blade would write vividly to boon companion at home about their amorous exploit in richmond , location , washington , or nashville . 
but these comment be hardly printable . 
an alabama soldier whose feminine association be of the more admirable type write boastfully of his achievement among the virginia belle : `` they think i be a saint . 
i tell them some sweet lie and they believe it all . 
i would tell them i get a letter from home state that five of my negro had run_away and ten of papa but i wold say i reckon he did not mind it for he have a plenty more left and_then they would lean to me like a sore-eyed kitten to a basin of milk '' . 
some of the letter be pungently expressive . 
an ohio soldier who , from a comrade just return from leave , receive an unfavorable comment on the conduct of his sister , take pen in hand and delivered himself thus : `` [ dear sis ] person say he hear that you and person was a runing together all_the_time and he think he wod gust quit have any thing mor to doo with you for he think it be no_more use . 
i think you make a damn good choice to turn_off as nice a fellow as person and let that ornery thieving , drunkard , damned card-playing son_of_a_bitch come to see you , the goddamned thief and lop-eared pigeon-toed hellion , he be too ornery for hell . 
i will shoot him as_shore_as i see him '' . 
initiation into combat sometimes elicit from soldier correspondent choice comment about their experience and reaction . 
a federal infantryman write to his father shortly after his first skirmish in virginia : `` dear pa . 
go_out a scouting yesterday . 
we get to one house where there be five secessionist they break + run and person holler_out to shoot the ornery son_of_a_bitch and we all let_go at them . 
thay may say what they please but godamit pa it be fun '' . 
some of the choice remark make by soldier in their letter be in disparagement of unpopular officer . 
a mississippi soldier write : `` our person be a vain , stuck-up , illiterate ass '' . 
an alabamian write : `` person be [ an ignoramus ] fit for nothing higher than the cultivation of corn '' . 
a floridian state that his officer be `` not fit to tote_guts_to_a_bear '' . 
on december ninth , 1862 , person , an unusual louisianan who hold ab and ma degree from harvard_university and who before the war be headmaster of a private_school for boy in louisiana , write his wife : 
`` i see person and he be the most insignificant puke i ever see . 
his head cannot contain enough sense to command a regiment , much less a corps . 
person run first and his cavalry be well drilled to follow their leader . 
he be not worth shucks . 
but he be a group graduate and therefore must be born to command '' . 
similar comment about officer are to be find in the letter of northern soldier . 
a massachusetts soldier , who seem to have be a civil_war version of person , write : `` the officer consider themselves as make of a different material from the lowly fellow in the rank . 
they get all the glory and most_of the pay and do n't earn ten cent apiece on_the_average , the drunken rascal '' . 
private person of pennsylvania write : `` i be well convinced in my own mind that had it not been for officer this war would have end long ago '' . 
another yankee become so disgust as to state : `` i wish to god one-half of our officer were knock in the head by slinging them against [ the other half ] '' . 
no group of officer come_in_for more spirited denunciation than the doctor . 
one federal_soldier write : `` the doctor be no-account . 
hell will be fill with doctor and officer when this war be over '' . 
shortly after the beginning of person 's georgia campaign , an ailing yank write his homefolk : `` the surgeon insist on sending me to the hospital for treatment . 
i insist on take_the_field and prevail - think that i had_better die by rebel bullet than [ by ] union quackery '' . 
the attitude which the reb and yank take toward each other be very_much the same and range over the same gamut of feeling , from friendliness to extreme hatred . 
the reb be , to a massachusetts corporal , `` fighting madman or not man at_all but whiskey + gunpowder put into a human frame '' . 
a pennsylvania soldier write that `` they be the hard looking set of man that ever i see they look as if they had been feed on vinegar and shaving '' . 
private person of the group write in his diary : `` i stroll among the alabaman on the right , find some of the green specimen of humanity i think in the universe their ignorance be little less_than the slave they despise with as imperfect a dialect ' they reckon as how you ' uns all would be a heap worse to we ' uns all '' ' . 
in a similar vein , but write from the opposite side , person , a private in the 6th group , in a letter to his wife , state : `` you know that my heart be with you but i never could have be satisfied to have stay at home when my country is invade by a thieving foe by a set of cowardly skunk whose motto be booty . 
as part of the same arrangement , person had , in the spirit of peace and good_will , and in exchange for armed support in the april election campaign , bestow upon person a third share in the group proceeds and a cut in the person beer trade . 
the coalition was to prove inadvisable . 
person be a complex and frightening man , whose bright_blue eye stare with a kind_of frozen candour into others ' . 
he have a round , frank irish face , crease in a jovial grin that stay_in_place bleakly in_place even when he was pump bullet into someone 's body . 
he carry three gun - one in the right trouser pocket , one under his left armpit , one in the left outside coat pocket - and be equally lethal with both hand . 
he kill accurately , freely , and dispassionately . 
the police credit him with twenty-five murder but he was never bring to trial for one of them . 
like a fair number of bootlegger he dislike alcohol . 
he be an expert florist , tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquet and wreath . 
he have no apparent comprehension of morality ; he divide humanity into `` right guy '' and `` wrong guy '' , and the wrong ones he be always willing to kill and trample under . 
he have what was describe by a psychologist as a `` sunny brutality '' . 
he walk with a heavy list to the right , as that leg be four inch short than the other , but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his gun . 
person think him `` just a superior sort of plug-ugly '' but he be , in_fact , with his aggression and hostility , and nerveless indifference to risk or administer pain , a casebook psychopath . 
he be also at this time , although not so interweave in high politics and the racket as person and person , the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the chicago underworld , the roughneck king . 
person was bear in poverty , the son of an immigrant irish plasterer , in the location 's location , close by the sicilian quarter and location . 
he had be a choirboy at the group and also serve as an acolyte to person . 
the influence of mass be less pervasive than that of the congested , slum tenement among the bawdyhouse , honkytonk , and sawdust_saloon of his birthplace ; he run wild with the child gang of the neighbourhood , and go_through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving , police dodging , and housebreaking . 
at the age of ten , when he was work as a newsboy in the location , he was knock_down by a streetcar which result in his permanently shortened leg . 
because of this he be known_as person ( but , as with person and his nickname of person , never in his presence ) . 
in his teens person was enroll in the vicious location gang and he become a singing waiter in group , a notoriously low and rowdy dive in location , where befuddled customer were methodically loot of their money by the singing waiter before being throw_out . 
he then get a job with the group as a circulation_slugger , a rough fighter employ to see that his paper 's news pitch were not trespass upon by rival vendor . 
he was also at_the_same_time gain practical experience as a safebreaker and highwayman , and learn how to shoot to kill from a neanderthal convicted murderer name person , later commit to group as a homicidal maniac , but whose eye mist with tear when the young person sing a ballad about an irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor . 
person 's first conflict with the police come in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was commit to group for three month for burglary ; two year later he serve another three month for assault . 
those be his only interlude behind bar , although he collect four more charge on his police record in 1921 and 1922 , three for burglary and one for robbery . 
but by now person 's political pull was begin to be effective . 
on the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $ 10000 bond was furnish by an alderman , and the charge was nolle_prossed . 
on one of his 1921 venture he was actually come_upon by a person down on his knee with a tool embed in a labour office safe in the location ; the jury want better evidence than that and he was acquit , at a cost of $ 30000 in bribe , it was estimate . 
as promptly as person , person jump into bootlegging . 
he conduct it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous violence than the sicilian , but he have his huge location portion to exploit and he make a great_deal of money . 
unlike the sicilian , he additionally conduct holdup , robbery , and safe cracking expedition , and refuse to touch prostitution . 
he be also personally active in ward politics , and by 1924 person had acquire sufficient political might to be able to state : `` i always deliver my borough as per requirement '' . 
but whose requirement ? 
until 1924 person pistoleer and knuckle_duster bullyboy had keep his location domain solidly democratic . 
there was a question and answer gag that go_around at that time : q. `` who 'll carry the forty-second and forty-third ward '' ? 
a. `` person , in his pistol pocket '' . 
but as november 1924 draw close the democratic hierarchy was sorely trouble by grapevine report that person was being woo by the opposition , and was meet and confer with important republican . 
to forestall any change of allegiance , the democrat hastily organise a testimonial banquet for person , as public reward for his past service and as a reminder of where his loyalty lie . 
the reception was hold in a private dining_room of the location on location . 
it be an interesting fraternisation of ex convict , union racketeer , ward-heeler , sold-out official , and gunman . 
the guest list be in itself a little parable of the state of american civic life at this time . 
it include the top person men and person . 
when person hear of the banquet he summon person for an explanation of why he had been dishonour the police_department by consort with these felon and fixer . 
person say that he had understand the party was to be in honour of person , the proprietor of a location gambling_house . 
`` but when i arrive and recognize a number of notorious character i had throw into the detective bureau basement half_a_dozen time , i know i had been frame , and withdraw almost at_once '' . 
in_fact , person was honour during the ceremony with the presentation of a $ 2500 diamond stickpin . 
there was a brief interruption while one of person 's men jerk out both his gun and threaten to shoot a waiter who was pester him for a tip . 
then person was present with a platinum watch set with ruby and diamond . 
this dinner be the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gang and the politician , which , prior to 1924 , say person , `` had been maintain with more_or_less stealth '' , but which henceforth was mark by these ostentatious gathering , denounce by a clergyman as `` belshazzar feast '' , at which `` politician fraternize cheek_by_jowl with gangster , openly , in the big downtown hotel '' . 
person continue : `` they become an institution of the chicago scene and mark the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county government in 1928_-_29 '' . 
however , this inaugural feast do_good its sponsor no good whatever . 
person accept his platinum watch and the tribute to his loyalty , and proceed with the bigger and better republican deal . 
on election_day - november fourth - he energetically marshal his force of bludgeon man , briber , and expert in forge repeat vote . 
the result be a landslide for the republican candidate . 
this further demonstration of person 's ballooning power did not please person and person . 
in the past year there had be too many example of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement for their liking . 
he behave publicly with a cocky , swaggering truculence that offend their vulpine latin mind , and behave towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enrage them beneath their blandness . 
they were disturb by his idiotic bravado - as , when his bodyguard , person , complain that he had been snub by person , a prizefight referee , chieftain of a jewish gang and one of four brother of tough reputation , who be person , a gambler politician in loose beer run league with person and person , person , a policeman , and person , the young . 
to settle this slight , person go down to the group in the location , where , he had learn , person was attend the opening of a musical_comedy . 
at the end of the performance , person and person come_out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first-nighter . 
person draw his gun and fire at person , severely wound him in the stomach . 
a second bullet ricochet off person 's belt_buckle , leave him unhurt but in some distress . 
person tuck away his gun and walk out of the theatre ; he was neither prosecute nor even arrest . 
that sort of braggadocio , for that sort of reason , in the view of person and person , be a nonsense . 
a further example of the incompatible difference in personality be when two policeman hold_up a person beer convoy on a location street and demand $ 300 to let it through . 
one of the beer runner telephone person - on a line tap by the detective bureau - and report the situation . 
person 's reaction be : 
`` three_hundred dollar ! 
to them bum ? 
why , i can get them knock_off for half that_much '' . 
upon which the detective bureau despatch rifle squad to prevent trouble if person should send his gunman out to deal with the hijacking policeman . 
but in_the_meantime the beer runner , unhappy with this solution , telephone person and return to person with the message : `` say , person , i just been talk to person , and he say to let them cop have the three_hundred . 
he say he do n't want no trouble '' . 
but person and person have grave cause to hate and distrust the irishman . 
for three year , since the liquor territorial conference , person had , with his elastic patience , and because he know that retaliation could cause only violent warfare and disaster to business , tolerate person 's impudent double-crossing . 
they had suffer , in sulky silence , the sight of his sharp practice in location . 
when , as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunman in the april election , person had give person a slice of location , the profits from that district had be $ 20000 a month . 
in six month person had boost the profits to $ 100000 a month - mainly by bring_to_bear pressure to bear on fifty chicago speakeasy proprietor to shift out to the suburb . 
these booze customer had until then been buy their supplies from the person , person , and person gang , and now they were compete for trade with the person saloon ; once_again person 's brash recklessness had cause a proliferation of ill_will . 
the revenue from person 's location territory go_up still high , until the yield be more_than the person takings from the far bigger trade area of chicago 's location and location . 
but he still show no intention of share with the syndicate . 
at_last , even the controlled person be unable to hold still , and he tentatively suggest that person should take a percentage in the location brothel in_return for one from his location beer concession . 
person 's reply be a raucous laugh and a flat refusal . 
still more jealous bitterness was engender by the person gang 's seizure from a location marshalling_yard of a freight_car load of canadian whisky worth $ 100000 and by one of the big coup of the prohibition_era - the location warehouse robbery , which become famous for the cool brazenness of the operation . 
here was store $ 1000000 worth of bonded whisky . 
these 1750 case were cart_off in a one night operation by the person men , who leave in their stead the same number of barrel fill with water . 
a tsunami may be start by a sea_bottom slide , an earthquake or a volcanic_eruption . 
the most infamous of all was launch by the explosion of the island of location in 1883 ; it race across the pacific at 300 mile an hour , devastate the coast of java and sumatra with wave 100 to 130 foot high , and pound the shore as faraway as san_francisco . 
the ancient greek record several catastrophic inundation by huge wave . 
whether or not plato 's tale of the lost continent of location be true , skeptic concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient time . 
indeed , a tremendously destructive tsunami that arise in the arabian_sea in 1945 has even revive the interest of geologist and archaeologist in the biblical story of the flood . 
one of the most damaging tsunami on record follow the famous lisbon earthquake of november 1st , 1755 ; its wave persist for a week and were feel as faraway as the english coast . 
tsunami be rare , however , in the atlantic_ocean ; they be far more common in the pacific . 
japan has have 15 destructive ones ( eight of them disastrous ) since 1596 . 
the hawaiian_islands are strike severely an average of once every 25 year . 
in 1707 an earthquake in japan generate wave so huge that they pile into the location ; one wave swamp more than 1000 ship and boat in location . 
a tsunami in the hawaiian_islands in 1869 wash away an entire town ( location ) , leave only two forlorn tree stand where the community had be . 
in 1896 a japanese tsunami kill 27000 people and sweep_away 10000 home . 
the dimension of these wave dwarf all our usual standard_of_measurement . 
an ordinary sea wave be rarely more than a_few hundred foot long from crest to crest - no long than 320 foot in the atlantic or 1000 foot in the pacific . 
but a tsunami often extend more than 100 mile and sometimes as much as 600 mile from crest to crest . 
while a wind wave never travel at more than 60 miles_per_hour , the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be reckon in hundred of miles_per_hour . 
the great the depth of the water , the great be the speed of the wave ; person 's law say that its velocity be equal to the square_root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due_to gravity . 
in the deep water of the pacific these wave reach a speed of 500 miles_per_hour . 
tsunami be so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they be hardly detectable . 
their amplitude sometimes be as little as two foot from trough to crest . 
usually it be only_when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build_up to their terrifying height . 
on the fateful day in 1896 when the great wave approach japan , fisherman at_sea notice no unusual swell . 
not until they sail home at the end of the day , through a sea strewn with body and the wreckage of house , be they aware of what had happen . 
the seemingly quiet ocean had crash a wall of water from 10 to 100 foot high upon beach crowded with bather , drown thousand of them and flatten village along the shore . 
the giant wave be more dangerous on flat shore than on steep ones . 
they usually range from 20 to 60 foot in_height , but when they pour into a v shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportion . 
generally the first salvo of a tsunami be a rather sharp swell , not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observer . 
this is follow by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore as the first great trough arrive . 
reef are leave high-and-dry , and the beach are cover with stranded fish . 
at location large_number of people run out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach . 
many_of them pay for their curiosity with their life , for some minute later the first giant wave roar over the shore . 
after an earthquake in japan in 1793 people on the coast at location be so terrified by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurry to high ground . 
when a second quake come , they dash back to the beach , fear that they might be bury under landslide . 
just as they reach the shore , the first huge wave crash upon them . 
a tsunami be not a single wave but a series . 
the wave are separate by interval of 15_minutes to an hour or more ( because of their great length ) , and this has often lull people into think after the first great wave has crash that it be all_over . 
the wave may keep come for many hour . 
usually the third to the eighth wave in the series be the biggest . 
among the observer of the 1946 tsunami at location be person of the group , one of the world 's foremost marine geologist . 
he be able to make a detailed inspection of the wave . 
their onrush and retreat , he report , was accompany by a great hissing , roaring and rattling . 
the third and fourth wave seem to be the high . 
on some of the island ' beach the wave come_in gently ; they be steep on the shore face the direction of the seaquake from which the wave had come . 
in location they be from 21 to 26 foot high . 
the high wave , 55 foot , occur at location . 
scientist and fisherman have occasionally see strange by-product of the phenomenon . 
during a 1933 tsunami in japan the sea glow brilliantly at night . 
the luminosity of the water is now believe to have been cause by the stimulation of vast number of the luminescent organism noctiluca_miliaris by the turbulence of the sea . 
japanese fisherman have sometimes observe that sardine haul up in their net during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomach ; the fish have swallow vast number of bottom living diatom , raise to the surface by the disturbance . 
the wave of a 1923 tsunami in location bring to the surface and batter to death huge number of fish that normally live at a depth of 3000 foot . 
gratified fisherman haul them in by the thousand . 
the tsunami warning system develop since the 1946 disaster in hawaii rely_on mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devise by person of the group staff . 
it consist_of a series of pipe and a pressure measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface . 
ordinary water tide are disregard . 
but when wave with a period of between 10 and 40 minute begin to roll over the ocean , they set_in_motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which close an electric_circuit . 
this in_turn set_off an alarm , notify the observer at the station that a tsunami be in progress . 
such equipment has been install at location , location , location and location . 
the moment the alarm go_off , information is immediately forward to honolulu , which be the center of the warning system . 
this center also receive prompt report on earthquake from four group station in the pacific which are equip with seismograph . 
its staff makes a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alert tide station near the epicenter for a tsunami . 
by means of chart show wave travel time and depth in the ocean at various location , it be possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time_of_arrival at hawaii of a tsunami get underway at any spot in the pacific . 
the civil and military authority are then advise of the danger , and they issue warning and take all necessary protective step . 
all_of these activity are gear to a top priority communication_system , and practice test have been hold to assure that everything will work smoothly . 
since the 1946 disaster there have be 15 tsunami in the pacific , but only one be of any consequence . 
on november 4th , 1952 , an earthquake occur under the sea off the kamchatka_peninsula . 
at 17_:_07 that afternoon ( greenwich_time ) the shock was record by the seismograph alarm in honolulu . 
the warning system immediately go into action . 
within about an hour with the help of report from seismic station in alaska , arizona and california , the quake 's epicenter was place at 51 degree north latitude and 158 degree east longitude . 
while account of the progress of the tsunami come_in from various point in the pacific ( location report it was cover with nine foot of water ) , the hawaiian station made its calculation and notify the military_service and the police that the first big wave would arrive_at honolulu at 23_:_30 greenwich_time . 
it turn_out that the wave be not so high as in 1946 . 
they hurl a cement barge against a freighter in location , knock_down telephone_line , maroon automobile , flood lawn , kill six cows . 
but not a single human life was lose , and property damage in the hawaiian_islands did not exceed $ 800000 . 
there is little doubt that the warning system save life and reduce the damage . 
but it be plain that a warning system , however efficient , be not enough . 
in the vulnerable area of the pacific there should be restriction against build home on exposed coast , or at_least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or anchor strongly against wave . 
the key to the world of geology be change ; nothing remain the same . 
life has evolve from simple combination of molecule in the sea to complex combination in man . 
the land , too , is change , and earthquake be daily reminder of_this . 
earthquake result when movement in the earth twist rock until they break . 
sometimes this is accompany by visible shift of the ground surface ; often the shift cannot be see , but they be there ; and everywhere can be find scar of earlier break once deeply buried . 
today 's earthquake be most numerous in belt where the earth 's restlessness be presently concentrated , but scar of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not have them . 
the effect of earthquake on civilization have been widely publicize , even overemphasize . 
the role of an earthquake in start the destruction of whole city be tremendously frightening , but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular disaster . 
superstition has often blend with fact to color report . 
we have learn from earthquake much of_what we now know about the earth 's interior , for they send wave through the earth which emerge with information about the material through which they have travel . 
these wave have show that 1800 mile below the surface a liquid core begin , and that it , in_turn , have a solid inner core . 
earthquake originate as far as 400 mile below the surface , but they do not occur at greater depth . 
two unsolved mystery are base on these fact . 
( 1 ) as far down as 400 mile below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting force by sluggish flow rather than by break , as rigid surface rock do . 
( 2 ) if earthquake do occur at such depth , why not deeply ? 
knowledge gain from study earthquake wave has been apply in various field . 
in the search for oil and gas , we make similar wave under controlled condition with dynamite and learn from them where there be buried rock structure favorable to the accumulation of these resource . 
we have also develop technique for recognize and locate underground nuclear test through the wave in the ground which they generate . 
the following discussion of_this subject has been adapt from the book causes_of_catastrophe by person . 
at twelve minute after five on the morning of wednesday , april 18th , 1906 , san_francisco was shake by a severe earthquake . 
a sharp tremor was follow by a jerky roll . 
in ireland 's location , near the location , there be a quiet little suburb by the name of location , which mean `` garden of person '' . 
undoubtedly none of the resident realize the influence their town has have on american military history , or the deed of valor that have been do in its name . 
the battle_cry `` location '' ! 
burst from the lip of a charge cavalry trooper be the last sound hear on this earth by untold number of cheyenne , sioux and apache , mexican banditos under person , japanese in the location , and chinese and north_korean communist in korea . 
location be the battle_cry of the group , `` the group '' . 
today a battle_cry may seem an anachronism , for in the modern army , esprit_de_corps has been sacrifice to organizational chart and table . 
but do n't tell that to a veteran of the group , especially in a saloon on saturday night . 
of all the thousand of man who have serve in the 7_th_cav , perhaps no one know its spirit better than person . 
wiry and burr-headed , with steel_blue eye and a chest splattered with medal , person be the epitome of the old-time trooper . 
the truth be , however , that when person first report to the regiment the only steed he had ever ride be a swivel_chair and the only weapon he had ever wield be a pencil . 
person had been commission in the group and was serve as a personnel officer for the group when he decide that if he was going_to make the army his career , he want to be in the fighting part of it . 
though he know no more about military science and tactics than any other desk_officer , he manage to get transfer to the combat force . 
the next thing he know he was report for duty as commanding_officer of group , 7_th_cavalry , in_the_middle of corps maneuver in japan . 
outside of combat , he could n't have land in a tough spot . 
first_of_all , no unit like to have a new commanding_officer bring_in from the outside , especially when he be an armchair trooper . 
second , if there be ever a perfect time to pull_the_rug_out_from_under him , it be on maneuver . 
in combat , help your commanding_officer make a fool of himself might mean get yourself kill . 
but in maneuver , with the top brass watch him all_the_time , it be easy . 
person understand this and expect the worst . 
but his first few day with group be full of surprise , begin with person . 
person had expect a tough old trooper with a gravel voice . 
instead person be quiet , sharp and confident . 
he had enlist in the army straight out of high_school and had immediately set_about learn his new trade . 
there be no weapon person could not take_apart and reassemble blindfolded . 
he could lead a patrol and he know his paperwork . 
further , he had take_advantage full advantage of the army 's correspondence_course . 
he not_only know soldiering , but mathematics , history and literature as_well . 
but for all his erudite confidence , person be right out of the location mold . 
he be filled with the spirit of the group . 
that save person . 
person let the new commanding_officer know just how lucky he be to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the united_states army . 
he feed the captain bit of history about the troops and the regiment . 
for_example , it be a battalion of the group under person that had been wiped_out at the battle_of_the_little_big_horn . 
it did n't take person long to realize that he have to carry a heavy load of tradition on his shoulder as commander of group . 
but what make the load light be the realization that every officer , noncom and trooper be ready and willing to help him carry it , for the good of the troop and the regiment . 
maneuver over , the group return to garrison duty in tokyo , person still with them . 
it be the group whose trooper were charge with guard the location . 
but still person be not completely convinced that man would really die for a four syllable word , `` location '' . 
the final proof be a small incident . 
it happen at the st._patrick 's_day party , a big affair for a regiment which had go_into battle for over three quarter of a century to the strain of an irish march . 
in_the_middle of the party person look up to see four smiling face bear_down upon him , each beam above the big , green shamrock he had ever see . 
the face belong_to person , his wife and their two child . 
and when the singing begin , it be the person who sing the old irish song the best . 
though there be an occasional good-natured chuckle about person , the jewish officer from chicago , sing tearfully about the old sod , no_one really think it be strange . 
for person , like person , the bugler boy who carry person 's last message , or person , the one-man army on leyte , be a location , through and through . 
it be no coincidence that person be one of the most beloved platoon leader in the regiment . 
and so person get the spirit of location . 
he set_out to keep group the best troop in the best regiment . 
one of his innovation be to see_to_it that every man - cook and clerk as_well_as rifleman - qualify with every weapon in the troop . 
even the mess sergeant , person , a dapper , cocky transfer from an airborne division , go_out on the range . 
the troop receive a new leader , person , fresh out of rotc and buck for regular_army status . 
person be sharp and military , but he be up against tough competition for that group berth , and he want to play it cool . 
so person set_out to sell him on the spirit of location , just as he himself had been sell a short time before . 
when the korean_war begin , on june 25 , 1950 , the anniversary of the day person had go_down fight at the location and the day the regiment had assault the beachhead of leyte during world_war_2 , , the group be not in the best fighting condition . 
its entire complement of noncommissioned officer on the platoon level had depart as cadre for another unit , and its vehicle be still those used in the drive across location in world_war_2 , . 
just a month after the korean_war break_out , the group was move_into the line , ready for combat . 
from then on the group be in the thick of the bitter fighting in korea . 
one night on the location , person call_on that fabled esprit_de_corps . 
the regiment was dig_in on the east_side of the river and the north_korean were steadily build_up a concentration of crack troop on the other side . 
the trooper know an attack be coming , but they did n't know when , and they did n't know where . 
at 6_o_'_clock on the morning of august 12 , they be in doubt no_longer . 
then it come , against group . 
the enemy had filter across the river during the night and a full force of 1000 man , armed with russian machine_gun , attack the position hold by person 's man . 
they come in wave . 
first come the cannon_fodder , white clad civilian being drive into death as a massive human battering_ram . 
they were follow by crack north_korean troop , who mount one charge after another . 
they overrun the group 's forward machine_gun position through sheer weight of number , over pile of_their_own dead . 
another force flank the company and take_up a position on a hill to the rear . 
person see that it was build_up strength . 
he assemble a group of 25 man , composed of wounded trooper await evacuation , the company clerk , supply man , cook and driver , and lead them to the hill . 
one of the more seriously wounded be person , the young officer buck for the regular_army . 
person leave person at the bottom of the hill to direct any reinforcement he could find to the fight . 
then person start up the hill . 
he take one step , two , break_into a trot and_then into a run . 
the first thing he know the word `` location '' ! burst from his throat . 
his follower shout the old battle_cry after him and charge the hill , fire as they run . 
the korean fall_back , but regroup at the top of the hill and pin down the cavalryman with a screen of fire . 
person , look_to right and left to see how his man were fare , suddenly see another figure bound up the hill , hurl grenade and holler the battle_cry as he run . 
it be person , who had suddenly find himself imbued with the spirit of location . 
he had form his own task_force of three straggler and lead them up the hill in a person charge . 
because of this diversionary_attack the main group that had been pin down on the hill be able to surge forward again . 
but an enemy grenade hit person in the head and detonate simultaneously . 
he go_down like a wet rag and the attacker hit_the_dirt in the face of the withering enemy fire . 
enemy reinforcement come pour down , seek a soft_spot . 
they find it at the junction between group , and prepare to counterattack . 
person see what was happen . 
he turn_to his platoon . 
`` okay , man '' , he say . 
`` follow me '' . 
person leap to his foot and start forward , `` location '' ! on his lip , his man follow . 
but the bullet whack home before he finish his battle_cry and person fall dead . 
for an instant his man hesitate , unable to believe that their lieutenant , the most popular officer in the regiment , be dead . 
then they let_out a bellow of anguish and rage and , curse , scream and holler `` location '' ! they charge into the enemy like wild_man . 
that finish the job that person and person had begin . 
person 's platoon push_back the enemy soldier and break_up the timing of the entire enemy attack . 
reinforcement come_up quickly to take_advantage of the opening make by person 's platoon . 
the north_korean throw_away their gun and flee across the rice_paddy . 
artillery and air strike were call_in to kill them by the hundred . 
though person seem to have had his head practically blow_off by the explode grenade , he live . 
today he be a major - in the regular_army . 
so fill be person with the spirit of location that after korea be over , he take_on the job of write the complete history of the regiment . 
after year of digging , night and weekend , he put_together the big , profusely illustrated book , of_garryowen_and_glory , which be probably the most complete history of any military_unit . 
the battle of the location be just one example of how the battle_cry and the spirit of the group have pay_off . 
for nearly a century the battle_cry has never fail to rally the fighting man of the regiment . 
take the case of person , who survive the battle_of_the_little_big_horn in 1876 . 
from the enlisted_man he pistol-whip to the subordinate officer whose wife he try to rape , a lot of man have plenty of reason heartily to dislike person . 
many_of his fellow officer refuse to speak_to him . 
but when a board of inquiry was call to look_into the charge of cowardice make against him , the man who had see person leave the battlefield and the officer who had hear person suggest that the wounded be leave to be torture by the sioux , refuse to say a harsh word against him . 
he be a member of the group . 
although it be at the battle_of_the_little_horn , about which more word have been write than any other battle in american history , that the group first make its mark in history , the regiment be ten year old by then . 
person be the regiment 's first permanent commander and , like such general as person and person in their rise to military prominence , person be a believer in blood-and-guts warfare . 
during the civil_war , person , who achieve a brilliant record , was make brigadier_general at the age of 23 . 
he finish the war as a major-general , command a full division , and at 25 be the young major-general in the history of the u.s. army . 
i do not mean to suggest that these assumption be self-evident , in the sense that everyone agree with them . 
if they be , person would be write the same column as person , and person would have nothing to draw cartoon about . 
i do mean , however , that i take_for_granted them for granted , and that everything i shall be say would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumption . 
the ultimate objective of american policy be to help establish a world in which there be the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity ; and in_particular - since this be our special responsibility - that these condition be enjoy by the people of the united_states . 
i speak_of `` the large possible measure '' because any person who suppose that these condition can be universally and perfectly achieve - ever - reckon without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human_being , and be therefore a dangerous man to have around . 
these condition be unobtainable - be not even approachable in the qualified sense i have indicate - without the prior defeat of world communism . 
this be true for two reason : because communism be both doctrinally , and in_practice , antithetical to these condition ; and because communist have the will and , as long as soviet power remain intact , the capacity to prevent their realization . 
moreover , as communist power increase , the enjoyment of these condition throughout the world diminish pro_rata and the possibility of their restoration become increasingly remote . 
it follow that victory over communism be the dominant , proximate goal of american policy . 
proximate in the sense that there be more distant , more `` positive '' end we seek , to which victory over communism be but a means . 
but dominant in the sense that every other objective , no_matter how worthy intrinsically , must defer to it . 
peace be a worthy objective ; but if we must choose between peace and keep the communist out of berlin , then we must fight . 
freedom , in the sense of self-determination , be a worthy objective ; but if grant self-determination to the algerian person entail sweep that area into the location orbit , then algerian freedom must be postpone . 
justice be a worthy objective ; but if justice for bantus entail drive the government of the south_africa away from the west , then the bantus must be prepared to carry their identification card yet a while longer . 
prosperity be a worthy objective ; but if provide high standard_of_living get in the way of produce sufficient gun to resist communist aggression , then material sacrifice and denial will have to be make . 
it may be , of_course , that such objective can be pursue consistently with a policy design to overthrow communism ; my point be that where conflict arise they must always be resolve in_favor_of achieve the indispensable condition for a tolerant world - the absence of soviet communist power . 
this much having been say , the question remain whether we have the resource for the job we have to do - defeat communism - and , if so , how those resource ought to be use . 
this bring us squarely to the problem of power , and the use a nation make of power . 
i submit that this be the key problem of international relations , that it always has be , that it always will be . 
and i suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we be in has be the failure of american policy_maker , ever since we assume free_world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously . 
in the recent political_campaign two charge were level affect the question of power , and i think we might begin by try to put them into proper focus . 
one be demonstrably false ; the other , for_the_most_part , true . 
the first be that america had become - or was in_danger_of become - a second-rate military power . 
i know i do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention . 
you may have misgiving about certain aspect of our military establishment - i certainly do - but you know any comparison of overall american strength with overall soviet strength find the united_states not_only superior , but so superior both in present weapon and in the development of new ones that our advantage promise to be a permanent feature of u.s. - soviet relations for the foreseeable future . 
i have often search for a graphic way of impress our superiority on those americans who have doubt , and i think person has do it well in his new book american_might_and_soviet_myth . 
suppose , he say , that the turn_the_tables , and we be in the soviets ' position : `` there would be more_than 2000 modern soviet fighter , all better than ours , station at 250 base in mexico and the caribbean . 
overwhelming russian naval power would always be within a_few hundred mile of our coast . 
half of the population of the u.s. would be need to work_on arms just to feed the people '' . 
add this to the unrest in the country around us where oppressed people would be ready to turn_on us at the first opportunity . 
add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep_abreast of the soviets even in the missile field which is repute to be our main strength . 
if we look_at the situation this way , we can get an idea of person 's nightmarish worry - or , at_least , of the worry he might have if his enemy were dispose to exploit their advantage . 
the other charge be that america 's political position in the world has progressively deteriorate in recent years . 
the contention needs to be formulate with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign , but once that has been do , i fail to see how any serious student of world_affairs can quarrel with it . 
the argument was typically advance in_terms_of u.s. `` prestige '' . 
prestige , however , be only a minor part of the problem ; and even then , it be a concept that can be highly misleading . 
prestige be a measure of how other people think_of you , well or ill . 
but contrary to what was imply during the campaign , prestige be surely not important for its own sake . 
only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign people are not as impress by our strength as they ought to be . 
the thing to lose sleep over be what people , having conclude that we be weak than we are , be likely to do about it . 
the evidence suggest that foreign people believe the united_states be weak than the soviet_union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the year ahead . 
this ignorant estimate , i repeat , be not of any interest in itself ; but it become very important if foreign people react the way human_being typically do - namely , by take step to end_up on what appear to be the winning side . 
to the extent , then , that declining u.s. prestige mean that other nation will be tempt to place their bet on an ultimate american defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to soviet intimidation , there be reason for concern . 
still , these guess about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the soviet_union and ourselves . 
here i do not speak_of military power where our advantage be obvious and overwhelming but of political power - of influence , if you will - about which the relevant question be : 
be soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it be ten year ago ? 
and be western influence greater or less than it used to be ? 
in answer these question , we need to ask not merely whether communist troops have cross over into territory they did not occupy before , and not merely whether disciplined agent of the cominform be in control of government from which they were formerly exclude : 
the success of communism 's war against the west does not depend_on such spectacular and definitive conquest . 
success may mean merely the displacement of western influence . 
communist political warfare , we must remember , is wage insidiously and in deliberate stage . 
fearful of invite a military showdown with the west which they could not win , the communist seek to undermine western power where the nuclear might of the west be irrelevant - in backwoods guerrilla skirmish , in mob uprising in the street , in parliament , in clandestine meeting of undercover conspirator , at the united_nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conference - preferably at the high level . 
the soviets understand , moreover , that the first_step in turn a country toward communism be to turn it against the west . 
thus , typically , the first stage of a communist takeover be to `` neutralize '' a country . 
the second stage be to retain the nominal classification of `` neutralist '' , while in_fact turn the country into an active advocate and adherent of soviet policy . 
and this may be as far as the process will go . 
the group 's goal be the isolation and capture , not of ghana , but of the united_states - and this purpose may be serve very well by country that masquerade under a `` neutralist '' mask , yet in_fact be dependable auxiliary of the soviet foreign_office . 
to recite the particular of recent soviet success be hardly reassuring . 
six year ago location , though in trouble , be in the western camp . 
today location be overtly communist ; laos is teeter between communism and pro communist neutralism ; cambodia be , for_all_practical_purposes , neutralist . 
indonesia , in the early_days of the republic , lean toward the west . 
today person 's government is heavily besiege by avowed communist , and for all_of its `` neutralist '' pretension , it be a firm ally of soviet policy . 
ceylon has move from a pro western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the west . 
in the middle_east , iraq , syria and egypt be , a short while ago , in the western camp . 
today the group and group government be adamantly hostile to the west , be dependent for their military power on soviet equipment and personnel ; in almost every particular follow the group 's foreign_policy line . 
a short time ago all africa be a western preserve . 
never_mind whether the kikiyus and the bantus enjoy wilsonian self-determination : the point be that in the struggle for the world that vast landmass be under the domination and influence of the west . 
today , africa is swerve violently away from the west and plunging , it would seem , into the soviet orbit . 
latin_america be once an area as `` safe '' for the west as nebraska be for person . 
today it be up_for_grabs . 
one latin-american country , cuba , has become a soviet bridgehead ninety mile off our coast . 
in some country the trend has go far than others : 
mexico , panama , and venezuela are display open sympathy for castroism , and there be no country - save the dominican_republic whose funeral service we recently arrange - where castroism and anti americanism does not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espouse the american cause . 
only in europe have our line remain_firm - and there only on the surface . 
the strain of neutralism are run strong , notably in england , and even in germany . 
what have we to show by_way_of counter success ? 
we have have opportunity - clear invitation to plant our influence on the other side of the iron_curtain . 
there be the hungarian revolution which we praise and mourn , but do nothing about . 
there be the polish revolution which we misunderstand and then help guide along a course favorable to soviet interest . 
there be the revolution in tibet which we pretend did not exist . 
only in one instance have we move purposely and effectively to dislodge existing communist power : 
in guatemala . 
and contrary to what has been say recently , we did not wait for `` outside pressure '' and `` world opinion '' to bring_down that communist government ; we move decisively to effect an anti communist coup . 
we serve our national interest , and by so doing we save the guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery . 
the first rattle of the machine_gun , at 7 : 10 in the evening , roused around me the varied voice and face of fear . 
`` sound exactly like last time '' . 
the young_man speak steadily enough , but all_at_once he look grotesquely unshaven . 
the middle-aged man say over_and_over , `` why did i come here , why did i come here '' . 
then he be sick . 
amid the crackle of small-arm and automatic weapon , i hear the thumping of mortar . 
then the light go_out . 
this be my second day in vientiane , the administrative capital of laos , and my thought be none too brave . 
where be my flashlight ? 
where should i go ? 
to my room ? 
better stay in the hotel lobby , where the wall look good and thick . 
chinese and indian merchant across the street were slam their steel shutter . 
hotel attendant pull parked bicycle into the lobby . 
a woman with a small boy slip in between them . 
`` please '' , she say , `` please '' . 
she hold_out her hand to show that she have money . 
the american newspaperman worry about get to the cable office . 
but what be the story ? 
had the communist led group finally come this far ? 
or be it another revolt inside vientiane ? 
`` let 's play hero '' , i say . 
`` let 's go to the roof and see '' . 
by 7 : 50 the answer be plain . 
there had be an eclipse of the moon . 
a traditional lao explanation be that the moon was being swallow by a toad , and the remedy be to make all possible noise , ideally with firearm . 
the din be successful , too , for just before the moon disappear , the frightened toad had begin to spit_out it out again , which mean good_luck all around . 
how quaint it all seem the next day . 
a restaurant post a reminder to patron `` who become excited and leave without pay their check '' . 
but everyone i meet had seek cover first and ask question later . 
and no wonder , for vientiane , the old city of location , had become the city of bullet_hole . 
i see hole in plane at the airport and in car in the street . 
along the main thoroughfare hardly_a house had not been pepper . 
in place of the police_headquarters be a new square fill with rubble . 
mortar had demolish the defense ministry and set fire to the american embassy next_door . 
what had be the ambassador 's suite be now jagged wall of blackened brick . 
this damage had been do in the battle of vientiane , fight less_than three month earlier when four successive government had rule here in three day ( december 9 - 11 , 1960 ) . 
and now , in march , all laos suffer a state of siege . 
the group force hold two northern province and openly take the offensive in three more . 
throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorist spread fear of ambush and death . 
`` and it be all the more tragic because it be so little deserved '' , say person , a belgian official of the group group . 
we talk after i hail his jeep mark with the group flag . 
practically all the people of laos , he explain - about two million of them - be rice farmer , and the means and motive of modern war be as strange to them as clock and steel plow . 
they look_after their field and child and water_buffalo in ten or eleven thousand village , with an average of 200 soul . 
nobody can tell more closely how many village there be . 
they spread over an area no larger than oregon ; yet they include people as different from one another as person be from person . 
`` what matter here be family loyalty ; faith in the_buddha and stay at peace with the phis , the spirit ; and to live in harmony with nature '' . 
harmony in laos ? 
`` precisely '' , say person . 
he speak_of the season of dryness and dust , bring by the monsoon from the northeast , in_harmony with the season of rain and mud , bring by the monsoon from the southwest . 
the slim pirogue in_harmony with the majestically meandering mekong_river . 
shy , slender-waisted girl at the loom in_harmony with the frangipani by the wayside . 
even life in_harmony with death . 
for so_long_as death be not violent , it be natural and to be welcome , make a funeral a feast . 
to many_a frenchman - they come 95 year ago , colonize , and stay until laos become independent in 1953 - the land had be even more delightfully tranquil than tahiti . 
yet laos be now one of the most explosive headache of statesman around the globe . 
the group , stiffen by communist veteran from neighboring north viet_nam , were supply by soviet aircraft . 
the group , on_the other hand , was pay and equip with american fund . 
in six year , u.s. aid had amount to more_than $ 1.60 for each american - a total of three hundred million dollar . 
we be there at a moment when the situation in laos threaten to ignite another war among the world 's giant . 
even if it did not , how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenade and submachine_gun ? 
to find_out , we travel throughout that part of laos still nominally control , in the daytime at_least , by the group : from location , the city of buffalo dung in the southeast , to location , the city of lion in the northwest , close to communist_china ( map , page 250 ) . 
we ride over road so rough that our jeep come to rest atop the soil between rut , all four wheel spin uselessly . 
we fly in rickety plane so overloaded that we wonder why they did n't crash . 
in_the_end we run_into communist artillery_fire . 
`` we '' be person of the group group , whose three camera and eight lens make him look as formidable as any fighting man we meet ; person , our interpreter ; and myself . 
person - the name mean one who have a boun , a celebration , and be therefore lucky - be born in location , the border of paradise . 
he had attend three university in the united_states . 
but he had never see the mountainous half of his native_land north of vientiane , include the royal capital , location . 
before the airplane come , he say , travel in laos be just_about impossible . 
alas , so it almost prove for us , too . 
to go outside the few city require permit . 
and get them seem a life 's work . 
nobody want american to be hurt or capture , and few soldier could be spare as escort . 
we were tell that to the group , a kidnaped american be worth at_least $ 750 , a fortune in laos . 
everyone had hear of the american contractor who had spurn an escort . 
now group propagandist were report march him barefoot from village to village , as evidence of evil american intervention . 
although we enjoy our round of the government_office in vientiane , with official offer tea and pleasing conversation in french , we were get nowhere . 
we had nearly decide that all the tale of lao lethargy must be true , when we were invite to take a trip with the prime_minister . 
could we be ready in 15_minutes ? 
his highness had decide only two hour ago to go_out of town , and he be eager to be off . 
and so , after a flight southeast to location , we find ourselves bounce along in a jeep right behind the landrover of person of location , a tall man of churchillian mien in a bush_jacket and a ten-gallon_hat from texas . 
from his shoulder_bag peeked the seven inch barrel of a luger . 
the temperature rise to 105 ` . 
with our company of soldier , we make one long column of reddish dust . 
in location , the city of silkworm , the prime_minister buy fried chicken and fried cicada , and two notebook for me . 
then we drive on , until there be no more road and we traverse dry rice field , bounce across their squat earth wall . 
it was a spleen crushing day . 
an hour of bouncing , a brief stop in a village to inspect a new school or dispensary . 
more bouncing , another stop , a new house for teacher , a new well . 
then off again , rush to keep_up . 
we be miserable . 
but our two jeep mate - person from location and person from location , pennsylvania - were beam under their coating of dust . 
together they had probably do more than any other man to help push laos toward the 20th th century - constructively . 
person , once a diplomat in paris and washington , be person . 
person , an engineer and anthropologist with a doctorate from the group , head the rural development division of group , the group administer u.s. aid . 
`` what you see be self-help project '' , person say . 
`` we ask the people what they want , and they supply the labor . 
we send shovel , cement , nail , and corrugated_iron for roof . 
that way they have an infirmary for $ 400 . 
we have 2500 such project , and they add_up to a_lot more_than just road and well and school . 
ask person '' . 
person agree . 
`` our people have been used_to accept thing as they find them '' , he say . 
`` where there was no road , they live without one . 
now they learn that man can change their surroundings , through their traditional village elder , without violence . 
that be a big step toward a modern state . 
you might say we be in the nation building business '' . 
in the village people line_up to give us flower . 
then come coconut , eggs , and rice wine . 
the prime_minister pay his respects to the buddhist monk , stride rapidly among the house , joke with the local soldiery , and make a speech . 
the soldier are fight and the american are help , he say , but in the fight against the group the key factor be the villager himself . 
then we be off again . 
we did it for three day . 
but our stumping tour of the south be n't all misery . 
cross the 4000 - foot width of the mekong at location , on a raft with an outboard_motor , we take_off our dusty shirt and enjoy a veritable ocean breeze . 
then we hang overboard in the water . 
briefly we roll over a paved road up_to location , on the cool location . 
the prince visit the hospital of operation brotherhood , support by the group of the philippines , and feed rice to two pet elephant he keep at his residence at location . 
in the village of location , which mean `` peaceful '' , we have a baci . 
this be the most endearing of lao ceremony . 
it take_place in the household , a rite of well-wishing for myriad occasion - for the traveler , a wedding , a newborn child , the sick , the new year , for any good purpose . 
the preparation be elaborate : flower , candle , incense stick , rice wine , dozens of delicacy , and piece of white cotton string . 
the string be draped around flower in tall silver bowl ( page 261 ) . 
the candle be lighted , and we sit on split bamboo mat among the village notable . 
i be careful to keep my foot , the seat of the least worthy spirit , from point at anyone 's head , where the worthy spirit reside . 
now a distinguished old_man call_on nine divinity to come and join us . 
next he address himself to our soul . 
a man have 32 soul , one for each part of the body . 
those soul like to wander off , and must be call back . 
with the divinity present and our soul in_place , we were wish health , happiness , and power . 
then , one_after_another , the villager tie the waiting cotton string around our wrist . 
these were to be keep on , to hold_in the 32 soul . 
as we step_out into the sunlight , a man come_up_to person and silently show him his hand . 
it have a festering hole as big as a silver_dollar . 
we could see maggot move . 
person say : `` i have some antiseptic salve with me , but it be too late for that '' . 
my interview with teenager confirm this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bond . 
jewish identity was often confuse with social and economic striving . 
`` be jewish give you tremendous drive '' , a boy remark . 
`` it mean that you have_to get_ahead '' . 
when i press for a purely religious definition , i encounter the familiar blend of liberal piety , interfaith good_will , and a small residue of ethnic loyalty . 
`` i like the tradition '' , a girl say . 
`` i like to follow the holiday when they come_along . 
but you do n't have_to worship in the traditional way . 
you can communicate in your own way . 
as i see it , there 's no real difference between be jewish , catholic , or protestant '' . 
another teenager remark : `` most jew do n't believe_in god , but they believe_in people - in help people '' . 
still another boy assert : `` to be a good jew be to do no wrong ; it be to be a good_person '' . 
when ask how this be different from be a good protestant , the boy answer , `` it be the same thing '' . 
this accord with the study by person and person . 
they discover that , although 42 percent of a sample of catholic student and 15 percent of the protestant believe it important to live in accordance with the teaching of their religion , only 8 percent of the jewish student have this conviction . 
the most important aim of the jewish student be as_follows : to make the world a better place to live in - 30 percent ; to get happiness for yourself - 28 percent ; and financial independence - 21 percent . 
nevertheless , most_of the teenager i interview believe_in maintain their jewish identity and even envision join a synagogue or temple . 
however , they be hostile to jewish orthodoxy , profess to believe_in judaism `` but in a moderate way '' . 
one boy say querulously about orthodox jew : `` it 's the twentieth century , and they do n't have_to wear beard '' . 
the reason offer for cling to the ancestral faith lack force and authority even in the teenager ' mind . 
`` we were bring_up that way '' be one statement which win general assent . 
`` i want to show respect for my parent ' religion '' be the way in_which a boy justify his inhabiting_a_halfway_house of judaism . 
still another suggest that he would join a temple `` for social reason , since i 'll be live in a suburb '' . 
intermarriage , which is generally regard_as a threat to jewish survival , was regard not with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild , clinical disapproval . 
most_of the teenager i interview reject it on pragmatic ground . 
`` when you marry , you want to have thing in common '' , a girl say , `` and it 's hard when you do n't marry someone with your own background '' . 
a fourteen year old girl from the middle_west observe wryly that , in her community , religion inconveniently interfere with religious activity - at_least with the peripheral activity that many middle-class jew now regard_as religious . 
it appear that an orthodox girl in the community disrupt plan for an outing sponsor by one of the jewish service group because she would not travel on saturday and , in_addition , require kosher food . 
another girl from a relatively large midwestern city describe herself as `` the only orthodox girl in town '' . 
this be , no_doubt , inaccurate , but it does convey how isolated she feel among the vast army of the nonobservant . 
one of the significant thing about jewish culture in the old teen years be that it be largely college oriented . 
sixty_five percent of the jewish teenager of college age attend institution of higher learning . 
this be substantially high than the figure for the american population at_large - 45.6 percent for male and 29.2 percent for female . 
this may help explain a phenomenon describe by a small_town jewish boy . 
in their first two year in high_school , jewish boy in this town make strenuous exertion to win position on the school team . 
however , in their junior and senior year , they generally forego their athletic pursuit , presumably in the interest of better academic achievement . 
it be significant , too , that the old teenager i interview believe , unlike the young ones , that jewish student tend to do better academically than their gentile counterpart . 
the percentage of jewish girl who attend college be almost as high as that of boy . 
the motivation for both sex , to_be_sure , be different . 
the vocational motive be the dominant one for boy , while jewish girl attend college for social reason and to become culturally developed . 
one of the significant development in american jewish life be that the cultural consumer be largely the woman . 
it be they who read - and make - jewish best_seller and then persuade their husband to read them . 
in upper teen jewish life , the non college group tend to have a sense of marginality . 
`` people automatically assume that i be in college '' , a nineteen year old machinist observe irritably . 
however , among the girl , there are some morale enhance compensation for not go_to college . 
the jewish working_girl almost invariably work in an office - in contradistinction to gentile factory_worker - and , buttressed by a respectable income , she be likely to dress better and live more expansively than the college_student . 
she be even prone to regard_as the college_girl as immature . 
one of the reason for the high percentage of jewish teenager in college be that a great many urban jew are enable to attend local college at modest cost . 
this be particularly true in large center of jewish population like new_york , chicago , and philadelphia . 
what be noteworthy about this large group of teenager be that , although their attitude hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterpart , they actually lead their life in a vast self-enclosed jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non jewish world . 
perhaps the jewish student at group - constitute 85 percent of those who attend the day session - can serve as a paradigm of the urban , lower-middle-class jewish student . 
there is , to begin , an important sex difference . 
typically , in a lower-middle-class jewish family , a son will be send to an out-of-town school , if financial resource warrant it , while the daughter will attend the local college . 
there are two reason for this . 
first , the girl 's education have a lower priority than the son 's . 
second , the attitude in jewish family be far more protective toward the daughter than toward the son . 
most jewish mother be determined to exercise vigilance over the social and sexual life of their daughter by keep them home . 
the consequence of this be that the girl at group outnumber the boy and do somewhat better academically . 
one can assume that some of the bright boy be out of town . 
group student have an ambivalent attitude toward their school . 
on_the_one_hand , there is a sense of not having move beyond the ambiance of their high_school . 
this be particularly acute for those who attend group directly across the street from group . 
they have a sense of marginality at being deny that special badge of status , the out-of-town school . 
at_the_same_time , there is a good_deal of self congratulation at attend a good college - they be even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtue - and they express pleasure at the cozy ingroup feeling that the college generate . 
`` it 's people of your own kind '' , a girl remark . 
`` you do n't have_to watch what you say . 
of_course , i would like to go_to an out-of-town school where there are all kind of people , but i would want lots of jewish kid there '' . 
for most group student , college be at_once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachment and a breaking_away from the cage of neighborhood and family . 
group be unequivocally jewish in tone , and effort to detribalize the college by bring_in unimpeachably midwestern type on the faculty have be unavailing . 
however , a growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitude impart by course in psychology and anthropology make the student increasingly critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parent . 
and the rebellion of these third generation jew be not the traditional conflict of culture but , rather , a protest against a culture that they view_as softly and insidiously enveloping . 
`` as_long_as i be home , i 'll never grow_up '' , a nineteen year old boy observe sadly . 
`` they do n't like it if i do anything away from home . 
it be so much trouble , i do n't usually bother '' . 
for girl , the overprotection be far more pervasive . 
parent will drive on friday night to pick_up their daughter after a sorority or house plan meeting . 
a freshman girl 's father not too long_ago call a dean at group and demand the `` low-down '' on a boy who was go_out with his daughter . 
the domestic tentacle even extend to the choice of a major field . 
under pressure from parent , the majority of group girl major in education since that coordinate best with marriage plan - limited graduate study requirement and convenient working hours . 
this mean that a great many academically talented girl are discourage from pursue graduate work of a more demanding nature . 
a kind of double_standard exist here for jewish boy and girl as it does in the realm of sex . 
the breaking_away from the prison_house of brooklyn be gradual . 
first , the student train on his hapless parent the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological and sociological insight . 
then , with the new affluence , there is actually a sallying_forth into the wide , wide world beyond the precinct of new_york . 
it be significant that the location , which used_to be the summer playground for old teenager , a kind of summer suburb of new_york , no_longer attract them in great number - except for those who work there as waiter , busboy , or counselor in the day_camp . 
the great world beyond beckon . 
but it should be point_out that some of the new watering_place - location , location , location , long_island , for_example - tend to be homogeneously jewish . 
although group does not_yet have a junior year abroad program , a good number of student spend summer in europe . 
in_general , however , the timetable of travel lag considerably behind that of the student at harvard or group . 
and acculturation into the world at_large be likely to occur for the group student after college rather_than during the four school_year . 
group be person territory , as much_as the_bronx or location . 
there are horde of nubile young_woman there who , prod by their impatient mother , be determined to marry . 
it be interesting that , although the percentage of married student be not appreciably high at group than elsewhere - about 30 percent of the woman and 25 percent of the man in the graduating_class - the anxiety of the unmarried has puff_up the estimate . 
`` almost everybody in the senior_class be married '' , student say dogmatically . 
and the school newspaper sell space to jubilant fraternity , sorority , and house ( in the group ) that have good news to impart . 
these announcement be , in_effect , advertisement for themselves as thriving marriage_mart . 
there are boxed proclamation in the newspaper of watching , pinning , ringing , engagement , and marriage in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity . 
`` group happily announce the engagement of person to person of group '' . 
the group student show some striking departure from prevailing collegiate model . 
the group enjoy no easy dominion here , and the boy be as likely to dress in rather foppish continental fashion , or even in nondescript working-class manner , as they be in the restrained , button-down group way . 
the girl be prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterpart out of town , and eyeshadow , mascara , and elaborate bouffant hairdo - despite the admonition of cautious guidance personnel - be not unknown even in early morning class . 
among the boy , there is very little bravado about drinking . 
group be distinctive for not have an official drinking place . 
the location encampment for drinking be foreign to most group boy . 
in a_few school district one find a link between school and job . 
in those vocational_program organize with group money , there may be a close tie between the labor_union and a local employer on_the_one_hand and the vocational teacher on the other . 
in these case a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program , save a year because of his vocational course in grade 11 and 12 . 
the apprentice program will involve further education on a part-time basis , usually at night , perhaps use some of the same equipment of the high_school . 
these opportunity are to be find in certain city in such_as craft as auto_mechanics , carpentry , drafting , electrical_work , tool-and-die_work , and sheet_metal work . 
formally organized vocational_program support by federal funds allow high_school student to gain experience in a field of work which be likely to lead to a full-time job on graduation . 
the `` diversified occupation '' program be a part-time trade preparatory program conduct over two school_year on a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business employer . 
the `` distributive education '' program operate in_a_similar_way , with arrangement between the school and employer in merchandising field . 
in both case the student attend school half-time and work in a regular job the other half . 
he receive remuneration for his work . 
in a_few place cooperative program between school and employer in clerical work have show the same possibility for allow the student , while still in school , to develop skill which be immediately marketable upon graduation . 
adult_education course , work-study_program of various sort - these be all evidence of a continuing interest of the school in further educational opportunity for out-of-school youth . 
in_general , however , it may be say that when a boy or a girl leave the high_school , the school authority play little or no part in the decision of what happen next . 
if the student drop_out of high_school , the break with the school be even more complete . 
when there be employment opportunity for youth , this arrangement - or lack of arrangement - work_out quite well . 
indeed , in some period of our history and in some neighborhood the job opportunity have be so good that undoubtedly a great many boy who be potential member of the profession quit school at an early age and went to work . 
statistically this has represent a loss to the nation , although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have be a wise one . 
i make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high_school and be highly successful in the business which he enter . 
he may or may_not be `` better_off '' than his classmate who go_on to a college and professional school . 
but in the next decade the nation needs_to educate for the profession all the potential professional talent . 
in a later chapter deal with the suburban school , i shall discuss the importance of arrange a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any high_school where he is find . 
in the negro neighborhood and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhood the problem may be one of identification and motivation . 
high motivation towards higher_education must start early enough so_that by the time the boy or girl reach grade 9 he or she has at_least develop those basic skill which be essential for academic work . 
undoubtedly far more can be do in the lower grade in this regard in the negro school . 
however , the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family be anti-intellectual . 
and the fact remain that there be today few shining example of negro in position of intellectual leadership . 
this be not due_to any policy of discrimination on_the_part_of the northern university . 
quite the contrary , as i can testify from personal experience as a former university president . 
rather we see here another vicious_circle . 
the absence of successful negro in the world of scholarship and science has tend to tamp_down enthusiasm among negro youth for academic career . 
i believe the situation is improve , but the success story need_to be heavily publicize . 
here again we run_into the roadblock that negro do not like to be designate as negro in the press . 
how can the vicious_circle be break ? 
this be a problem to which leader of opinion , both negro and white , should devote far more attention . 
it be at_least as important as the more dramatic attempt to break_down barrier of inequality in the south . 
i should_like to underline four point i made in my first report with respect_to vocational education . 
first_and_foremost , vocational course should not replace course which be essential part of the required academic_program for graduation . 
second , vocational course should be provide in grade 11 and 12 and not require more_than half the student 's time in those year ; however , for slow learner and prospective dropout these course ought_to begin earlier . 
third , the significance of the vocational course be that those enrolled be keenly interested in the work ; they realize the relevance of what they are learn to their future career , and this sense of purpose is carry_over to the academic course which they are study at_the_same_time . 
fourth , the type of vocational training_program should be related to the employment opportunity in the general locality . 
this last point be important because if high_school pupil be aware that few , if any , graduate who have choose a certain vocational_program have obtain a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappear . 
vocational training which hold no hope that the skill develop will be in_fact a marketable skill become just another school `` chore '' for those whose interest in their study has begin to falter . 
those who , because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employer to train their own employee , would limit vocational education to general rather_than specific skill ought_to bear_in_mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience . 
i have been use the word `` vocational '' as a layman would at_first_sight think it should be use . 
i intend to include under the term all the practical course open to boy and girl . 
these course develop skill other_than those we think_of when we use the adjective `` academic '' . 
practically all_of these practical skill be of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtain in high_school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at_once on the basis of the skill . 
they be in this sense skill marketable immediately on graduation from high_school . 
to_be_sure , in tool-and-die_work and in the building trade , the first job must be often on an apprentice basis , but two year of half-time vocational training enable the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status . 
similarly , a girl who graduate with a good working knowledge of stenography and the use of clerical machine and who be able to get a job at_once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community_college or secretarial_school . 
of_course , it can be argue that an ability to write english correctly and with some degree of elegance be a marketable skill . 
so , too , be the mathematical competence of a college graduate who has major in mathematics . 
in_a_sense almost all high_school and college course could be consider as vocational to the extent that later in life the student in his vocation ( which may be a profession ) will be call_upon to use some of the skill develop and the competence obtain . 
in_spite_of the shading of one type of course into another , i believe it be useful to talk_about vocational course as apart from academic course . 
perhaps a course in typewriting might be regard_as the exception which prove the rule . 
today many college bound student try to take a course in personal typing , as they feel a certain degree of mastery of this skill be almost essential for one who propose to do academic work in college and a professional school . 
most_of our largest city have one or more separate vocational or technical high_school . 
in this respect , public education in the large city differ from education in the smaller city and consolidated school district . 
the neighborhood high_school be not , strictly_speaking , comprehensive school , because some of the boy and girl may be attend a vocational or technical high_school instead of the local school . 
indeed , one school_superintendent in a large city object to the use of the term comprehensive high_school for the senior_high_school in his city , because these school do not offer strictly vocational_program . 
he prefer to designate such school as `` general '' high_school . 
the suburban high_school , it be worth note , also be not a widely comprehensive high_school because of the absence of vocational_program . 
the reason be that there be a lack of interest on the part of the community . 
therefore employment and education in all the school in a metropolitan area be related in different way from those which be characteristic of the comprehensive high_school describe in my first report . 
the separate vocational or technical high_school in the large city must be reckon as permanent institution . 
by_and_large their program be satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the reality of the apprentice system . 
it is not often realize to_what_degree certain trade be in many community closed area of employment , except for a lucky few . 
one has_to talk confidentially with some of the director of vocational high_school to realize that a boy cannot just say , `` i want to be a plumber '' , and then , by do good work , find a job . 
it be far more difficult in many community to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involve union approval than to get_into the most selective medical_school in the nation . 
two story will illustrate what i have_in_mind . 
one vocational instructor in a city vocational_school , speak of his course in a certain field , say he have no difficulty place all student in job outside of the city . 
in the city , he say , the waiting_list for those who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy have an inside_track he can n't get_in . 
in a far distant part of the united_states , i was talk to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade was do special work . 
`` what does he have_in_mind to do when he graduate '' ? 
`` oh , he 'll be a plumber '' , come the answer . 
`` but is n't it almost impossible to get_into the union '' ? 
i ask . 
`` he 'll have no difficulty '' , i was tell . 
`` he have very good connection '' . 
in my view , there should be a school which offer significant vocational_program for boy within easy reach of every family in a city . 
ideally these school should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical course be at the highest . 
an excellent example of a successful location of a new vocational high_school be the group in chicago . 
located in a bad slum_area now undergo redevelopment , this school and its program are especially tailor to the vocational aim of its student . 
hardly_a window has been break since group first was open ( and vandalism in school be a major problem in many slum_area ) . 
i discover in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupil be negro . 
they were learn trade as diverse as shoe_repairing , bricklaying , carpentry , cabinet making , auto_mechanics , and airplane_mechanics . 
the physical facility at group be impressive , but more impressive be the attitude of the pupil . 
in_general , religious interest seem to exist in all part of the metropolis ; congregational membership , however , be another thing . 
a congregation survive only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership ; that_is , when it can preserve economic integration . 
religious faith can be consider a necessary condition of membership in a congregation , since the decision to join a worshiping group require some motive force , but faith be not a sufficient condition for join ; the presence of other member of similar social and economic level be the sufficient condition . 
the breakdown of social homogeneity in inner_city area and the spread of inner_city blight account_for the decline of central_city church . 
central_city reveal two adverse feature for the major denomination : 
( 1 ) central_city tend to be area of residence for lower social_class ; ( 2 ) central_city tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition . 
the central_city area , in_other_words , exhibit the two characteristic which violate the life_principle of congregation of the major denomination : they have too few middle-class people ; they mix middle-class people with lower-class resident . 
central_city area have become progressively poor locale for the major denomination since the exodus of middle-class people from most central_city . 
with few exception , the major denomination are rapidly lose their hold on the central_city . 
the key to protestant development , therefore , be economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation . 
member of high and lower social_status often cluster around this nucleus , so_that protestant figure on social_class give the impression of spread over all social_class ; but this be deceptive , for the core of membership be concentrated in a single social and economic stratum . 
the congregation perish when it is no_longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood ; moreover , residential mobility be so high in metropolitan area that church have_to recruit constantly in their core stratum in_order to survive ; they can lose high - and lower status member from the church without collapse , but they need adequate recruit for the core stratum in_order to preserve economic integration . 
the congregation be first_and_foremost an economic peer_group ; it be secondarily a believe and worshiping fellowship . 
if it be primarily a believe fellowship , it would recruit believer from all social and economic rank , something which most congregation of the new protestantism ( with a_few notable exception ) have not be able to do . 
they survive only when they can recruit social and economic peer . 
the vulnerability of protestant congregation to social difference has often been attribute to the `` folksy spirit '' of protestant religious life ; in_fact , a contrast is often draw in this regard with the `` impersonal '' roman_catholic parish . 
we have see that the folksy spirit is confine to economic peer ; consequently , the vulnerability to social difference should not be attribute to the stress on personal community in protestant congregation ; actually , there be little evidence of such personal community in protestant congregation , as we shall see in another connection . 
the vulnerability of protestantism to social difference stem from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation be a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform_to , therefore , to the principle of economic integration . 
this fact be evident in the recruitment of new member . 
the rule of economic integration in congregational life can be see in the missionary outreach of the major denomination . 
there be much talk in theological circle about the `` church as mission '' and the `` church 's mission '' ; theologian have been stress the fact that the church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world . 
a crucial question , therefore , be what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan protestantism . 
if economic integration really shape congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extend economic integration . 
the task of a congregation would be define , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opt individual and family of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation . 
( co-optation mean to choose by joint action in_order to fill a vacancy ; it can also mean the assimilation of center of power from an environment in_order to strengthen an organization . ) 
in a mobile society , congregational health depend_on a constant process of recruitment ; this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather_than proclamation - like element will have_to be assimilate . 
evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully study in the church ; one study in pittsburgh , however , has illuminate the situation . 
in a sample of new member of pittsburgh church , almost 60 percent were recruit by initial `` contact with friendly member '' . 
if we add to these contact with friendly member the `` contact with an organization of the church '' ( 11.2 percent of the case ) , then a substantial two third of all recruitment be through friendly contact . 
on the surface , this seem a sound approach to christian mission : member of the congregation show by their friendly attitude that they care_for new people ; the new people respond in_kind by join the church . 
missionary outreach by friendly contact look somewhat different when one reflect on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhood ; the majority of such contact be with people of similar social and economic position ; association by level of achievement be the dominant principle of informal relations . 
this mean that the antenna of the congregation are extend into the community , pick_up the wavelength of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation ; the mission of the church be actually a process of informal co-optation ; the lay ministry be a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social_class nucleus of the congregation . 
church can be strengthen through this process of co-optation so_long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration ; once the pool of recruit diminish , the congregation be helpless - friendly contact no_longer keep it go . 
the transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicate by the insignificance of educational_activity , worship , preaching , and publicity in reach new member . 
the proclamation of the church is almost totally confine to pastoral contact by the clergy ( 17.3 percent of new member ) and friendly contact by member ( over two third if organizational activity are include ) . 
publicity account_for 1.1 percent of the initial contact with new member . 
in_general , friendly contact with a member follow by contact with a clergyman will account_for a major share of recruitment by the church , make it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation be the principal form of mission in the contemporary church ; economic integration and co-optation be the two method by which protestant associate with and recruit from the neighborhood . 
the inner life of congregation will prosper so_long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together ; the outer life of congregation - the suitability of the environment to their survival - will be propitious so_long as the people in the area be of the same social and economic level as the membership . 
economic integration cease when the social and economic status in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation . 
in a rapidly changing society congregation will run_into difficulty repeatedly , since such nice balance of economic integration be hard to sustain in the metropolis for more_than a single generation . 
the fact that metropolitan church of the major denomination have move approximately every generation for the last hundred year become somewhat more intelligible in the light of_this struggle to maintain economic balance . 
the expense of_this type of organization in religious life , when one recall the number of city church which deteriorate beyond repair before being abandon , raise fundamental question about the principle of protestant survival in a mobile society ; nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregation illumine the nature of the protestant development . 
it was observe in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trend - expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal grouping . 
these trend seem to be work at cross-purpose in the metropolis . 
residential association struggle to insulate themselves against intrusion . 
the motif of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential community have polarize ; the schism between central_city and suburb , negro and white , blue-collar and white-collar can be view_as symptomatic_of this deep polarization of trend in the metropolis . 
it now become evident that the denominational church is intimately involved_with the economy of middle-class culture , for it serve to crystallize the social_class identity of middle-class residential grouping . 
the accelerated pace of metropolitan change has accentuate the drive to conformity in congregation of the major denomination . 
this conformity represent a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment . 
more_than creature of metropolitan force , the church have take the lead in counteract the interdependence of metropolitan life , crystallize and perpetuate the stratification of people , give form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous people . 
since american life be committed above_all to productivity and a high standard of economic life , the countervailing force of residential and religious exclusiveness have fight a desperate , rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis . 
consumer community have suffer at_the_hands_of the productive interest . 
negro , puerto_rican , and rural newcomer are slowly make_one's_way their way into the city . 
soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburb , and the church will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterize their history for a century . 
the identification of the basic unit of religious organization - the parish or congregation - with a residential area be self-defeating in a modern metropolis , for it simply mean the closing of an iron_trap on the outreach of the christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation . 
mission to the metropolis contradict survival of the congregation in the residential community , because the middle_class are fight metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion . 
this interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projection for the church . 
it could be argue that any fellowship which center in residential neighborhood is doom to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle_class . 
it could be argue that only such neighborhood can sustain religious activity , since worship presuppose some local stability . 
whatever projection one makes , the striking fact about congregational and parochial life be the extent to_which it be a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people . 
attention will be give in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational church ; this style be characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle_class . 
the keynote of_this style be activism and emphasis on achievement in gain self-esteem . 
these values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman , dictate the method of child rearing , determine the pattern of community participation , set the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness , and inform the congregational life of the major denomination . 
`` fellowship by likeness '' and `` mission by friendly contact '' form the iron_cage of denominational religion . 
its content be another matter , for they reveal the kind of interest pursue by the congregation . 
what go_on in the cage will occupy our attention under the rubric of the organization church . 
an understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serve to illuminate the force which have fashion the iron_cage of conformity which imprison the church in their suburban captivity . 
the perplexing question still remain as to why the middle_class turn_to the church as a vehicle of social identity when their club and charity should fill the same need . 
nothing like person , he arrive before the hour . 
his letter had suggest we meet at my hotel at noon on sunday , and i come into the lobby as the clock strike twelve . 
he was wait . 
my wish to meet person had been prompt by simple curiosity and interest in his work . 
american newspaper reviewer like to call his play nihilistic . 
they find deep pessimism in them . 
even so astute a commentator as person of the group has say that `` waiting_for_godot '' be `` the concentrate of the contemporary european mood of despair '' . 
but to me person 's writing had seem permeated with love for human_being and with a kind of humor that i could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism . 
could it be that my own eye and ear had deceive me ? 
is his a literature of defeat , irrelevant to the social crisis we face ? 
or is it relevant because it teach us something useful to know about ourselves ? 
i know that a conversation with the author would not settle such question , because a man be not the same as his writing : in_the_last_analysis , the question had to be settle by the work itself . 
nevertheless i be curious . 
my curiosity was sharpen a day or two before the interview by a conversation i have with a well-informed teacher of literature , a jesuit father , at a conference on religious drama near paris . 
when person 's name come into the discussion , the priest grow loud and tell me that person `` hate life '' . 
that , i think , be at_least one thing i can find_out when we meet . 
person 's appearance be roughhewn irish . 
the feature of his face be distinct , but not fine . 
they look as if they had been sculpture with an unsharpened chisel . 
unruly hair go straight up from his forehead , stand so high that the top fall gently over , as if to show that it really be hair and not bristle . 
one might say it combine the man ; own pride and humility . 
for he have the pride that come of self_acceptance and the humility , perhaps of the same genesis , not to impose himself upon another . 
his light blue eye , set deep within the face , are actively and continually look . 
he seem , by some unconscious division of labor , to have give them that one function and no other , leave communication to the rest of the face . 
the mouth frequently break_into a disarming smile . 
the voice be light in timbre , with a rough edge that correspond to his visage . 
the irish accent is , as one would expect , combine with slight inflection from the french . 
his tweed suit be a baggy gray and green . 
he wear a brown knit sport_shirt with no tie . 
we walk down the location , thence along beside the location and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church . 
the conversation that ensue may have been engrossing but it could hardly be call world-shattering . 
for_one_thing , the world that person see be already shattered . 
his talk turn_to what he call `` the mess '' , or sometimes `` this buzzing confusion '' . 
i reconstruct his sentence from note make immediately after our conversation . 
what appear here be short than what he actually say but very close to his own words . 
`` the confusion be not my invention . 
we cannot listen to a conversation for five minute without be acutely aware of the confusion . 
it be all around us and our only chance now be to let it in . 
the only chance of renovation be to open our eye and see the mess . 
it be not a mess you can make sense of '' . 
i suggest that one must let it in because it be the truth , but person did not take_to the word truth . 
`` what be more true than anything else ? 
to swim be true , and to sink be true . 
one be not more true than the other . 
one cannot speak anymore of being , one must speak only of the mess . 
when person and person speak of a contrast between being and existence , they may be right , i do n't know , but their language be too philosophical for me . 
i be not a philosopher . 
one can only speak of what be in_front of him , and that now be simply the mess '' . 
then he begin to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form . 
until recently , art has withstand the pressure of chaotic thing . 
it has hold them at_bay . 
it realize that to admit them was to jeopardize form . 
`` how could the mess be admit , because it appear to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art hold itself to be '' ? 
but now we can keep_out it out no_longer , because we have come into a time when `` it invade our experience at every moment . 
it be there and it must be allow_in '' . 
i grant this might be so , but find the result to be even more attention to form than be the case previously . 
and why not ? 
how , i ask , could chaos be admit to chaos ? 
would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art ? 
if we look_at recent art we find it preoccupied with form . 
person 's own work be an example . 
play more highly formalized than `` waiting_for_godot '' , `` endgame '' , and `` krapp 's_last_tape '' would be hard to find . 
`` what i am say does not mean that there will henceforth be no form in art . 
it only mean that there will be new form , and that this form will be of such a type that it admit the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos be really something else . 
the form and the chaos remain separate . 
the latter is not reduce to the former . 
that is why the form itself become a preoccupation , because it exist as a problem separate from the material it accommodate . 
to find a form that accommodate the mess , that be the task of the artist now '' . 
yet , i respond , could not similar thing be say about the art of the past ? 
is it not characteristic of the greatest art that it confront us with something we cannot clarify , demand that the viewer respond to it in his own never predictable way ? 
what be the history of criticism but the history of man attempt to make sense of the manifold element in art that will not allow themselves to be reduce to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory ? 
is n't all art ambiguous ? 
`` not this '' , he say , and gesture toward the madeleine . 
the classical line of the church which person think_of as a temple of glory , dominate all the scene where we sit . 
the location , the location , and the location run to it with graceful flattery , bear tidings of the age_of_reason . 
`` not this . 
this be clear . 
this does not allow the mystery to invade us . 
with classical art , all be settled . 
but it be different at location . 
there be the unexplainable , and there art raise question that it does not attempt to answer '' . 
i ask about the battle between life and death in his play . 
person and person hover on the edge of suicide ; person 's world be death and person may or may_not get_out of it to join the living child outside . 
is this life_death question a part of the chaos ? 
`` yes . 
if life and death did not both present themselves to us , there would be no inscrutability . 
if there be only darkness , all would be clear . 
it is because there be not_only darkness but also light that our situation become inexplicable . 
take person 's doctrine of grace give and grace withhold : have you ponder the dramatic quality in this theology ? 
two thief are crucify with christ , one saved and the other damned . 
how can we make sense of this division ? 
in classical drama , such problem do not arise . 
the destiny of racine 's phedre is seal from the beginning : she will proceed into the dark . 
as she go , she herself will be illuminate . 
at the beginning of the play she have partial illumination and at the end she have complete illumination , but there has be no question but that she move toward the dark . 
that be the play . 
within this notion clarity be possible , but for us who be neither greek nor jansenist there be not such clarity . 
the question would also be remove if we believe in the contrary - total salvation . 
but where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable . 
the key word in my play be ' perhaps '' ' . 
give a theological lead , i ask what he think about those who find a religious significance to his play . 
`` well , really there be none at_all . 
i have no religious feeling . 
once i have a religious emotion . 
it be at my first communion . 
no_more . 
my mother be deeply religious . 
so be my brother . 
he kneel down at his bed as long as he could kneel . 
my father have none . 
the family be protestant , but for me it be only irksome and i let it go . 
my brother and mother get no value from their religion when they die . 
at the moment of crisis it have no_more depth than an old school tie . 
irish catholicism be not attractive , but it be deep . 
when you pass a church on an irish bus , all the hand flurry in the sign_of_the_cross . 
one day the dog of ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pig '' . 
but do the play deal with the same facet of experience religion must also deal with ? 
`` yes , for they deal with distress . 
some people object to this in my writing . 
at a party an english intellectual - so-called - ask me why i write always about distress . 
as if it be perverse to do so ! 
he want to know if my father had beat me or my mother had run_away from home to give me an unhappy childhood . 
i tell him no , that i had have a very happy childhood . 
then he think me more perverse than ever . 
i leave the party as soon as possible and get_into a taxi . 
on the glass partition between me and the driver be three sign : 
one ask for help for the blind , another help for orphan , and the third for relief for the war refugee . 
one does not have to look_for distress . 
it is scream at you even in the taxi of london '' . 
lunch be over , and we walk back to the hotel with the light and dark of paris scream at us . 
the personal quality of person be similar to quality i had find in the play . 
he say nothing that compress experience within a closed pattern . 
`` perhaps '' stand in_place of commitment . 
at_the_same_time , he be plainly sympathetic , clearly friendly . 
if there be only the mess , all would be clear ; but there be also compassion . 
as a christian , i know i do not stand where person stand , but i do see much of what he see . 
as a writer on the theater , i have pay_attention close attention to the play . 
person be right to say that `` waiting_for_godot '' be a reflection ( he call it a distorted reflection ) `` of the impasse and disarray of europe 's present politics , ethic , and common way_of_life '' . 
yet it is not only europe the play refer to . 
`` waiting_for_godot '' sell even better in america than in france . 
the consciousness it mirror may have come earlier to europe than to america , but it be the consciousness that most `` mature '' society arrive_at when their success in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examine the not strictly practical end of culture . 
america is now join europe in this `` mature '' phase of development . 
whether any of us remain in it long will depend_on what happen as a result of the technological and economic revolution now go_on in the country of asia and africa , and also of_course on how long the cold_war remain cold . 
there were fence in the old day when we be child . 
across the front of a yard and down the side , they be iron , either spiked along the top or arched in half circle . 
alley fence were make of solid board high than one 's head , but not so high as the golden_glow in a corner or the hollyhock that grow in a line against them . 
side fence be hidden beneath lilac and hundred_leaf rose ; front fence were cover with virginia_creeper or trumpet_vine or honeysuckle . 
square corner_post - and gatepost be an openwork pattern of cast_iron foliage ; they were top by steeple complete in every detail : high-pitched roof , pinnacle , and narrow gable . 
on these post the gate swing open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang . 
the only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fence be that obtain from an upper bough of the apple_tree . 
the primary quality of that view seem , now , to have be its quietness , but that cannot at the time have impress us . 
what one actually remember be its greenness . 
from high in the tree , the whole block lie within range of the eye , but the ground be almost nowhere visible . 
one look down on a sea of leaf , a breaking wave of flower . 
every path from back door to barn was cover by a grape_arbor , and every yard have its fruit_tree . 
in the center of any open space remaining our grandfather had plant syringa and sweet_shrub , snowball , rose_of_sharon and balm_of_gilead . 
from above one could only occasionally catch_a_glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea : a neighbor 's gingham skirt flash into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape_arbor , or the movement of hand above a clothesline and the flutter of garment hang there , halfway down the block . 
that be one epoch : the apple_tree epoch . 
another had end before it begin . 
time be a queer thing and memory a queer ; the trick that time plays_with memory and memory with time be queer of all . 
from maturity one look_back at the succession of year , count them and make them many , yet cannot feel length in the number , however large . 
in a stream that turn a millwheel there be a_lot of water ; the millpond be quiet , its surface dark and shadowed , and there does not seem to be much water in it . 
time in the sum be nothing . 
and yet - a year to a child be an eternity , and in the memory that phase of one 's being - a certain mental landscape - will seem to have endure without beginning and without end . 
the part of the mind that preserve date and event may remonstrate , `` it could have been like that for only a_little while '' ; but true memory does not count nor add : it hold fast to thing that be and they be outside of time . 
once , then - for how many year or how few does not matter - my world be bound round by fence , when i be too small to reach the apple_tree bough , to twist my knee over it and pull_up myself up . 
that world be in scale with my own smallness . 
i have no picture in my mind of the garden as_a_whole - that i could not see - but certain aspect of certain corner linger in the memory : windblown , frostbitten , white chrysanthemum beneath a window , with their brittle brown leaf and their sharp scent of november ; ripe pear lie in long grass , to be turn_over by a dusty slippered foot , cautiously , lest bee still work in the ragged , brown edged hole ; hot colored verbena in the corner between the dining_room wall and the side porch , where we pass on_the_way to the pump with the half gourd tie to it as a cup by my grandmother for our childish pleasure in drink from it . 
it be mother who plant the verbena . 
i think that my grandmother be not an impassioned gardener : 
she be too indulgent a lover of dog and grandchild . 
my great_grandmother , i have been tell , make her garden her great pride ; she cherish rare and delicate plant like oleander in tub and wallflower and lemon verbena in pot that have to be winter in the cellar ; she fill the waste spot of the yard with common thing like the garden_heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed , and the plantain_lily along the west_side of the house . 
these my grandmother leave in their place ( they be still there , more persistent and long-lived than the generation of man ) and plant others like them , that flourish without careful tending . 
three of these only were protect from us by stern commandment : the rose , whose petal may_not be collect until they had fall , to be make into perfume or rose tea to drink ; the peony , whose tight sticky bud would be blight by the laying_on of_a finger , although they were not apparently harm by the ant that crawl over them ; and the poppy . 
i have more_than once sit cross-legged in the grass through a long summer morning and watch without touch while a poppy bud high than my head slowly but visibly push off its cap , unfold , and shake out like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petal . 
other flower we might gather as we please : myrtle and white_violet from beneath the lilac ; the lilac themselves , that bloom so prodigally but for_the_most_part beyond our reach ; snowball ; hollyhock blossom that , turn upside-down , make pink petticoated lady ; and the little , dark_blue larkspur that scatter its seed everywhere . 
more potent a charm to bring back that time_of_life than this record of a_few picture and a_few remembered fact would be a catalogue of the minutia which be of the very stuff of the mind , intrinsic , because they were known in_the_beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that hold them . 
flower , stone , and small creature , living and dead . 
pale yellow snapdragon that by pinch could be make to bite ; seedpod of the balsam that snap like firecracker at a touch ; red and yellow columbine whose round tipped spur were pick_off and eat for the honey in them ; morning_glory bud which could be so grasp and squeeze that they burst like a blown-up paper_bag ; bright flower from the trumpet_vine that make `` gloves '' on the end of ten waggle finger . 
fuzzy caterpillar , snail with their sensitive horn , struggling grasshopper hold by their long hind_leg and command to `` spit tobacco , spit '' . 
dead fledgling bird , their squashed looking nakedness and the odor of decay that cling_to the hand when they had been bury in our graveyard in_front_of the purple flag . 
and the cast shell of a locust , straw colored and transparent , weigh nothing , fragile but entire , with eye like bubble and a gaping slit down its back . 
every morning early , in the summer , we search the trunk of the tree as high as we could reach for the locust shell , carefully detach their hooked claw from the bark where they hang , and stable them , a weird faery herd , in an angle between the high root of the tulip_tree , where no grass grow in the dense shade . 
we collect `` lucky stone '' - all the creamy translucent pebble , wear smooth and round , that we could find in the driveway . 
when these had been pocket , we could still spend a morning crack open other pebble for our delight in see how much pretty they be inside than their dull exterior indicate . 
we show them to each other and say `` would you have guess '' ? 
squat on our haunch beside the flat stone we break them on , we be safe behind the high closed gate at the end of the drive : safe from interruption and the observation and possible amusement of the passerby . 
thus shielded , we play many foolish game in comfortable unselfconsciousness ; even when the fence become a part of the game - when a vine embowered gatepost be the sleeping_beauty 's enchanted castle , or when person let_down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire , even then we pay little heed to those who go_by on the path outside . 
we enjoy a paradoxical freedom when we be still too young for school . 
in the heat of the summer , the garden solitude be ours alone ; our elder stay in the dark house or sit fan on the front_porch . 
they never trouble_oneself about us while we were play , because the fence form such a definite boundary and `` do n't go_out outside the gate '' be a command so impossible of misinterpretation . 
we be not , however , entirely unacquainted_with the varying aspect of the street . 
we be forbidden to swing on the gate , lest they sag on their hinge in a poor_white_trash way , but we could stand on them , when they be latched , rest our chin on the top , and stare and stare , commit to memory , quite unintentionally , all the detail that lie before our eye . 
the street that be full now of traffic and parked car then and for many year drowse on an august afternoon in the shade of the curbside tree , and silence be a weight , almost palpable , in the air . 
every slight sound that rise against that pressure fall_away again , crushed beneath it . 
a hay wagon move slowly along the gutter , the top of it sweep by the low bough of the maple tree , and loose straw were leave hang tangled among the leaf . 
a wheel squeak on a hub , be still , and squeak again . 
if a child watch its progress he whisper , `` hay , hay , load of hay - make a wish and turn_away '' , and then stare rigidly in the opposite direction until the sound of the horse ' foot return no_more . 
when the hay wagon had go , and an interval pass , a huckster 's cart might turn the corner . 
the horse walk , the rein be slack , the huckster ride with bowed shoulder , his forearm across his knee . 
sleepily , as if half reluctant to break the silence , he lift his voice : `` rhubarb nice fresh rhubarb today '' ! 
the lazy singsong be spaced in time like the drone of a bumblebee . 
no one seem to hear him , no one heed . 
the horse plod on , and he repeat his call . 
it become so monotonous as to seem a part of the quietness . 
after his passage , the street be empty again . 
the sun move slantwise across the sky and down ; the tree ' shadow circle from street to sidewalk , from sidewalk to lawn . 
at four o'clock , or four thirty , the coming of the newsboy mark the end of the day ; he toss a paper toward every front_door , and housewife come down to their steps to pick_up them up and read what their neighbor had been do . 
the street of any county town be like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer ; they be like this fifty odd year ago , and yesterday . 
but the fence be still in_place fifty odd years ago , and when we stand on the gate to look over , the sidewalk under our eye be not cement but two row of paving_stone with grass between and on both side . 
the curb be a line of stone lay edgewise in the dirt and tilt this way and that by frost in the ground or the root of tree . 
opposite every gate be a hitching_post or a stone carriage step , set with a rusty iron ring for tie a horse . 
the street be unpaved and rise steeply toward the center ; it be mud in wet weather and dust , ankle-deep , in dry , and could be cross only at the corner where there were stepping_stone . 
it have a bucolic atmosphere that it has lose long_since . 
the hoofmark of cattle and the footprint of bare foot in the mud or in the dust be as numerous as the trace of shod horse . 
cows were keep in backyard barn , boy were hire to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge of town , and familiar to the ear , morning and evening , be the boy ' coaxing voice , the thud of hoof , and the thwack of a stick on cowhide . 
the `` reality '' to which they respond be rationally empty and their art be an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and empty world . 
their artistic rationale be given to the witness of unreason . 
these polar concern ( imitation vs. formalism ) reflect a philosophical and religious situation which has been develop over a long period_of_time . 
the breakdown of classical structure of meaning in all realm of western culture has give_rise to several generation of artist who have document the disintegrative process . 
thus the image of man has suffer complete fragmentation in personal and spiritual quality , and complete objectification in subhuman and quasi mechanistic power . 
the image of the world tend to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or_else to dissolve into empty space and overwhelming mystery . 
the image of god has simply disappear . 
all such imitation of negative quality have give_rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism : if man can neither know nor love reality as it be , he can at_least invent an artistic `` reality '' which be its own world and which can speak_to man of purely personal and subjective quality capable of being know and worthy of being love . 
the person of the artist become a final bastion of meaning in a world render meaningless by the march of event and the decay of classical religious and philosophical system . 
whatever pole of this contrast one emphasize and whatever the tension between these two approach to understand the artistic imagination , it will be readily see that they be not mutually_exclusive , that they belong together . 
without the decay of a sense of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulate into being . 
and although these insight into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age require that they be take seriously and give promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapter in the philosophy of art may be write . 
for better or worse we cannot regard `` imitation '' in the art in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism . 
a broad concept of imitation be needed , one which acknowledge that true invention be important , that the artist 's creativity in part transcend the non artistic causal_factor out of which it arise . 
on_the_other_hand , we cannot regard artistic invention as pure , uncaused , and unrelated to the times in which it occur . 
we need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism . 
accordingly , it be the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation ( which i shall call mimesis in_order to distinguish it from earlier theory of imitation ) and a new theory of invention ( which i shall call symbol for reason to be state hereafter ) . 
the word `` mimesis '' ( `` imitation '' ) is usually associate with plato and aristotle . 
for plato , `` imitation '' be twice removed from reality , be a poor copy of physical appearance , which in itself be a poor copy of ideal essence . 
all artistic and mythological representation , therefore , be `` imitation of imitation '' and are completely supersede by the truth value of `` dialectic '' , the proper use of the inquiring intellect . 
in plato 's judgment , the art play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young , prior to the full development of their intellectual power . 
presuppose in plato 's system is a doctrine of level of insight , in which a certain kind of detached understanding be alone capable of penetrate to the most sublime wisdom . 
aristotle also tend to stratify all aspect of human nature and activity into level of excellence and , like plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level . 
the poetics , in affirm that all human art be `` mode of imitation '' , give a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did plato . 
but aristotle keep the principle of level and even augment it by describe in the poetics what kind of character and action must be imitate if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truth . 
for both plato and aristotle artistic mimesis , in_contrast_to the power of dialectic , be relatively incapable of express the character of fundamental reality . 
the central concern of person 's impressive volume called mimesis be to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of level of truth ) to a christian theory of imitation in which the level are dissolve . 
follow the theme of incarnation in the gospels , the christian artist and critic see in the most commonplace and ordinary event `` figure '' of divine power and reality . 
here artistic realism involve the audience in an impassioned participation in event whose overtone and implication be transcendent . 
artistic mimesis under christian influence record the involvement of all person , however humble , in a divine drama . 
the artist , unlike the philosopher , be not a removed observer aim at neutral and rarified high level of abstraction . 
he be the conveyor of a sacred reality by which he has been grasp . 
i have choose to use the word `` mimesis '' in its christian rather than its classic implication and to discover in the concrete form of both art and myth power of theological expression which , as in the christian mind , be the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience , which are not reserve , as in the greek mind , only to moment of theoretical reflection . 
in the first instance , `` mimesis '' is here use to mean the recall of experience in_terms_of vivid image rather than in_terms_of abstract idea or conventional designation . 
by `` image '' is mean not_only a visual presentation , but also remembered sensation of any of the five sense plus the feeling which are immediately conjoin therewith . 
this be the primary function of the imagination operate in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the image were first appropriate . 
mimesis be the near possible thing to the actual reliving of experience , in which the imagine person recover through image something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself . 
the image themselves , like their counterpart in experience , be not neutral quality to be survey dispassionately ; they be fields_of_force exert a unique influence on the sensibility and a unique relatedness to one_another . 
they bring an inextricable component of value within themselves , with attraction and repulsion native to their own quality . 
as in experience one is seize by given entity and their interrelation and is force to respond in value feeling to them , so one is similarly seize in the mimetic presentation of image . 
mimesis here is not to be confuse with literalism or realism in the conventional sense . 
a word taken in its dictionary meaning , a photographic image of a recognizable object , the mere picturing of a `` scene '' tend to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstraction as to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feeling . 
similarly experience itself can be conventionalize so that people react to certain preconceived clue for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field . 
a truly vivid imagination move beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy . 
the mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tend to express itself in the presentation of artistic form and material . 
when word can be use in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sight and sound , when tone of sound and color of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibility with an undeniable force of datum in and of themselves , compel the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitate the way experience itself in its deep character strike upon the door of consciousness and clamor for entrance . 
these be like the initial way in which the world force itself upon the self and thrust the self into decision and choice . 
the presence of genuine mimesis in art is mark by the persistence with which the work demand attention and compel valuation even_though it is but vaguely understand . 
underlie these conception of mimesis are certain presupposition concern the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed . 
experience is not see , as it is in classical rationalism , as present us initially with clear and distinct object simply located in space and register their character , movement , and change on the tabula_rasa of an uninvolved intellect . 
neither is primary experience understand according_to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing is think to be receive other_than signal of sensory quality produce their response in the appropriate sense_organ . 
primary feeling of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known object ( house , tree , implement , etc . ) nor a collection of isolated and neutral sensory quality . 
in_contrast_to all this , primary datum be datum of a self involved in environ process and power . 
the most primitive feeling be rudimentary value feeling , both positive and negative : a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself ; a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part . 
these desire presuppose a sense of causally efficacious power in which one be involved , some work for one 's good , others threaten ill . 
gone be the tabula_rasa of the mind . 
in its place be a passionate consciousness grasp and mold to feeling of positive or negative value even as the action of one 's life are determine by constellation of process in which one is catch . 
the principal defender of this view of primary experience as `` causal efficacy '' be person . 
our most elemental and unavoidable impression , he say , be those of be involved in a large arena of power which have a long past than our own , which be interrelated in a vast movement through the present toward the future . 
we feel the quality of these power initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening . 
later abstractive and rational process may indicate error of judgment in these apprehension of value , but the apprehension themselves be the primary stuff of experience . 
it take a great_deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unity of power and influence and to view one 's world simply as a collection of sense_datum arranged in such-and-such sequence and pattern , devoid_of all power to move the feeling and action except in_so_far as they present themselves for inspection . 
person is here question person 's understanding of the nature of experience ; he is question , also , every epistemology which stem from person 's presupposition that experience be merely sense_datum in abstraction from causal efficacy , and that causal efficacy be something intellectually impute to the world , not directly perceive . 
what person call `` sensation '' be what person call `` perception in the mode of presentational immediacy '' which be a sophisticated abstraction from perception in the mode of causal efficacy . 
as_long_as perception is see as composed only of isolated sense_datum , most_of the quality and interconnectedness of existence lose its objectivity , become an invention of consciousness , and the result be a philosophical scepticism . 
person contend that the human way of understand existence as a unity of interlocking and interdependent process which constitute each_other and which cause each_other to be and not to be be possible only because the basic form of such an understanding , for all its vagueness and tendency to mistake the detail , is initially give in the way man feel the world . 
in this respect experience be broad and full of a rich variety of potential meaning than the mind of man or any of his art or culture be capable of make clear and distinct . 
a chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy be one of derivation from the past . 
both i and my feeling come_up out of a chain of event that fan_out into the past into source that be ultimately very unlike the entity which i now be . 
after only eighteen year of noninterference , there were already indication of melioration , though `` in a slight degree '' , to_be_sure . 
there were more indication by the mid twentieth century . 
i leave it to the statistician to say what they be , but i notice several a_few year ago , during an automobile ride from memphis to location . 
in town after town my companion point_out the negro school and the white school , and in every instance the former make a better appearance ( it be new , for_one_thing ) . 
it really look as if a change of the sort predict by person had been go_on . 
but with the renewal of interference in 1954 ( as with its beginning in 1835 ) , the improvement was impair . 
for over a_hundred year southerner have feel that the north was pick on them . 
it be infuriating , this feeling that one is being pick on , continually , constantly . 
by what right of superior virtue , southerner ask , do the people of the north do this ? 
the traditional strategy of the south has been to expose the vice of the north , to demonstrate that the north possess no superior virtue , to `` show the world that '' ( as person 's person say to his adversary ) `` however bad i may be , you be not quite the people to say it '' . 
in the pre civil_war year , the south argue that the slave was not less humanely treat than the factory_worker of the north . 
at the present_time , the counterattack take the line that there 's no more of the true spirit of `` integration '' in the north than in the south . 
the line be a pretty good one . 
people talk_about `` the law of the land '' . 
the expression has become quite a cliche . 
but people can n't be make to integrate , socialize ( the two be inseparable by southern standard ) by law . 
i was have lunch not_long ago ( apology to person ) with three distinguished historian ( one specialize in the european middle_ages , one in american history , and one in the far_east ) , and i ask them if they could name instance where the general mores had been radically change with `` deliberate speed , majestic instancy '' ( person 's words for the hound_of_heaven 's pursuit ) by judicial fiat . 
they did n't seem to be able to think_of any . 
a virginia judge a while back cite a roman jurist to the effect that ten year might be a reasonable length of time for such a change . 
but i suspect that the old roman was refer to change make under military occupation - the sort of change which person was talk_about when he say , `` they make a desert , and call it peace '' ( `` solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant '' . ) 
. 
moreover , the law of the land be not irrevocable ; it can be change ; it has been , many time . 
person 's person decision in 1857 be unpopular in the north , and soon become a dead_letter . 
prohibition be the law of the land , but it be unpopular ( how many of us oldster take_up drinking in prohibition day , drinking be so gay , so fashionable , especially in the sophisticated northeast ! ) 
and was repeal . 
the cliche lose its talismanic virtue in the light of a_little history . 
the declaration_of_independence say that `` government derive their just power from the consent of the governed '' . 
the phrase `` consent of the governed '' need a hard look . 
how do we define it ? 
be the consent of the governed a numerical majority ? 
person deal with this question in his `` disquisition_on_government '' . 
to guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority , person develop his theory of `` concurrent majority '' , which , he say , `` by give to each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the action of government , a negative on the others , prevent all partial or local legislation '' . 
who will say that our country be even now a homogeneous community ? 
that regional peculiarity do not still exist ? 
that the court_order does not unequally affect the southern region ? 
who will deny that in a vast portion of the south the federal action be incompatible with the jeffersonian concept of `` the consent of the governed '' ? 
circumstance alter case . 
a friend of mine in new_mexico say the court_order had cause no particular trouble out there , that all had go as merry as a marriage bell . 
he seem a_little surprised that it should have cause any particular trouble anywhere . 
i murmur something about a possible difference between new_mexico 's history and mississippi 's . 
one can meet_with aloofness almost anywhere : the thank-heaven-we 're_-_not-involved viewpoint , it does n't affect us ! 
southern liberal ( there be many ) - especially if they be rich - often exhibit blithe insouciance . 
the trouble here be that it be almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it does n't cost you anything . 
you 've already send your daughter to person 's select academy for girl and your son to person 's select academy for boy , and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity . 
if there 's no suitable academy in your own neighborhood , there 's always new_england . 
new_england academy welcome fugitive from the province , south as_well_as west . 
they may even enroll a colored student or two for show , though he usually turn_out to be from thailand , or any place other_than the american south . 
it would be interesting to know how much `` integration '' there is in the famous , fashionable college and prep_school of new_england . 
a recent newspaper report say there were five negro in the 1960 graduating_class of nearly one_thousand at yale ; that_is , about one-half of one percent , which look pretty `` tokenish '' to me , especially in an institution which profess to be `` national '' . 
i must confess that i prefer the liberal who be personally affected , who be willing to send his own child to a mixed school as proof of his faith . 
i leave_out of account the question of the best interest of the child , the question of what their best interest really be . 
i 'm talk_about the grand manner of the liberal - north and south - who be not affected personally . 
if these people were deny a voice ( do they have a moral right to a voice ? ) 
, what voice would be left ? 
who be involved willy-nilly ? 
well , after everybody has follow the new_england pattern of segregate one 's child into private_school , only the poor folk be left . 
and it be precisely in this poor economic class that one find , and has always find , the most racial friction . 
a dear , respected friend of mine , who like myself grow_up in the south and has spend many year in new_england , say to me not_long ago : `` i can n't forgive new_england for reject all complicity '' . 
be a teacher of american literature , i remember person 's `` massachusetts_to_virginia '' , where he say : `` but that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone , and reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sow '' . 
there is a legend ( person record it in his `` english_notebooks '' . 
and one find it again in thomas_nelson_page ) to the effect that the mayflower on its second voyage bring a cargo of negro slave . 
whether historically a fact or not , the legend have a certain symbolic value . 
complicity be an embarrassing word . 
it be something which most_of us try to get_out from under . 
like the cowboy in person 's `` blue_hotel '' , we run around cry , `` well , i did n't do anything , did i '' ? 
person put it this way in `` brother_to_dragons '' : 
`` the recognition of complicity be the beginning of innocence '' , where innocence , i think , mean about the same thing as redemption . 
a man must be able to say , `` father , i have sin '' , or there is no hope for him . 
person understand this better than most when he say in his `` second inaugural '' that god `` give to both north and south this terrible war , as the woe due to those by whom the offense come '' . 
he also speak_of `` the wealth pile_up by the bondsman 's two_hundred_and_fifty year in unrequited toil '' . 
person be historian and economist enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulate in the hands of the descendants of new_englander engage in the slave_trade . 
after how many generation is such wealth ( mount all the while through the manipulation of high_finance ) purify of taint ? 
it be a question which new_englander long_ago put out of their mind . 
but did n't they get_off too easy ? 
the slave never share in their profits , while they did share , in a very real sense , in the profits of the slave owner : they were feed , clothe , doctor , and_so_forth ; they be the beneficiary of responsible , paternalistic care . 
person - platonist , idealist , doctrinaire - sound_off a high transcendental note in his `` boston_hymn '' , deliver in 1863 in the boston location amidst thundering applause : `` pay ransom to the owner and fill the bag to the brim . 
who be the owner ? 
the slave be owner , and ever be . 
pay him '' ! 
it be the abstractionism , the unrealism , of the pure idealist . 
it ignore the sordid financial aspect ( quite conveniently , too , for his audience , who could indulge in moral indignation without visible , or even conscious , discomfort , their money from the transaction having been put_away long_ago in a good antiseptic brokerage ) . 
like person , they had washed_their_hands . 
but can one , really ? 
can god be mock , ever , in_the_long_run ? 
new_englander be a_bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the declaration_of_independence , as person explain in his `` autobiography '' : `` the clause reprobate the enslaving the inhabitant of africa was strike_out in complaisance to south_carolina and georgia , who had never attempt to restrain the importation of slave , and who on_the_contrary still wish to continue it . 
our northern brother also i believe feel a_little tender under those censure ; for though their people have very few slave themselves , yet they had be pretty considerable carrier of them to others '' . 
but that be a long_time ago . 
the new_england conscience become desensitized . 
person ( naturalize new_englander ) , write in 1889 from `` paradise_road , location '' ( lovely symbolic name ) , agitate continuously the `` southern question '' . 
it be nice to be able to isolate it . 
new_england , as everyone know , has long be schoolmaster to the nation . 
there one find concentrate in a comparatively small area the chief university , college , and preparatory_school of the united_states . 
why should this be so ? 
it be true that new_england , more_than any other section , be dedicated to education from the start . 
but i think that something more than this be involved . 
how did it happen , for_example , that the state university , that great symbol of american democracy , fail to flourish in new_england as it did in other part of the country ? 
be n't it a_bit odd that the three state of southern new_england ( massachusetts , connecticut , and rhode_island ) have have state institution of university status only in the very recent past , these institution having previously be group ? 
was it suppose , perchance , that group ( vocational_training , that_is ) be quite sufficient for the immigrant_class which flood that part of the new_england world in the post civil_war period , the immigrant having been bring_in from southern europe , to work in the mill , to make_up for the labor shortage cause by migration to the west ? 
be it not ironical that person 's state , rhode_island , should have be the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university ? 
the state university of maine , new_hampshire , and vermont be old and more `` respectable '' ; they have less immigration to contend with . 
a yale historian , write a_few year ago in the yale_review , say : `` we in new_england have long_since segregate our child '' . 
he was refer not_only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory_school . 
and what a galaxy of those adorn that fair land ! 
i do n't propose to go into their history , but i have one or two surmise . 
one be that they were establish , or gain eminence , under pressure provide by these same immigrant , from whom the old family wish to segregate their child . 
in the early_days of a homogeneous population , the public_school be quite satisfactory . 
among the recipient of the nobel_prize for literature more_than half be practically unknown to reader of english . 
of these there be surely few that would be more rewarding discovery than person , the swedish poet and novelist who receive the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrate two year ago . 
equally a master of prose and verse , he recreate the glory of sweden in the past and continue it into the present . 
in the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as_much_as_possible speak_for himself . 
person be born in 1859 , of a prosperous family . 
on his father 's side he be of german descent , on his mother 's he come of the old swedish nobility . 
the family estate was situate near location on location ^ location in south central sweden . 
it be a lonely , rather desolate region , but full of legendary and historic association . 
as a boy in a local school he be shy and solitary , absorbed in his fondness for nature and his vision of sweden 's ancient glory . 
he like to fancy himself as a chieftain and to dress for the part . 
be somewhat delicate in health , at the age of sixteen he was send to southern europe , for which he at_once develop a passion , so that he spend nearly all_of the following ten year abroad , at_first in italy , then in greece , egypt , asia_minor , and palestine . 
in one of his summer at home he marry , to the great disapproval of his father , who object because of his extreme youth . 
decide to become a painter , he enter the studio of person in paris , where he enjoy the life of the artist , but soon find that whatever talent he might have did not lie_in that direction . 
he give us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem , `` the_happy_artists '' . 
`` i scan the world through printed_symbol swart , and through the beggar 's rag i strive to see the inner man . 
i look unceasingly with my cold mind and with my burning heart '' . 
in this final line , we have the key to his nature . 
few writer have better understand their deep self . 
person could never be satisfy by surface . 
it may , however , be note that his gift for color and imagery must have been greatly stimulate by his stay in paris . 
the first result of person 's long sojourn abroad be a volume of poem , pilgrimage_and_wander_years ( vallfart_och_vandringsar ) , publish in 1888 . 
it be a brilliant debut , so_much_so indeed that it arouse a new vitality in the young poet , as did person 's childe_harold . 
person ^ o ^ k , sweden 's foremost critic of the period , acclaim it as_follows : `` in this we have the verse of a painter ; strongly colorful , plastic , racy , vivid . 
in a bold , sometimes careless , form there be nothing academic ; all is see and feel and experience , the observation be sharp and the imagination lively . 
the young poet painter reproduce the french life of the street ; he tell story of the thousand_and_one_nights , and conjure_up before us the bazaar of damascus . 
in the carefree indolence of the east he see the last reflection of the old happy existence , and for that reason he love it . 
and yet amid all the gay hedonism in pilgrimage and wander-years be a cycle of short poem , '' thoughts_in_loneliness `` , filled with brooding , melancholy , and sombre longing '' . 
of the long piece of the volume none be so memorable as `` nameless_and_immortal '' , which at_once took rank among the finest poem ever written in the swedish language . 
it celebrate the unknown architect who design the temple of neptune at location , next to the parthenon the noble example of grecian classic style now in existence . 
on the eve of his return to their native location he speak with his wife of the masterpiece which rise before them in its completed perfection . 
the supreme object of their life is now fulfil , say the wife , her husband has achieve immortality . 
not so , he answer , it is not the architect but the temple that be immortal . 
`` the man 's true reputation be his work '' . 
the short poem group at the end of the volume as `` thoughts_in_loneliness '' be , as person ^ o ^ k indicate , in sharp contrast with the others . 
it consist_of fragmentary personal revelation , such_as `` the_spark '' : 
`` there be a spark dwell deep within my soul . 
to get_out it out into the daylight 's glow be my life 's aim both first and last , the whole . 
it slip_away , it burn and torture me . 
that little spark be all the wealth i know , that little spark be my life 's misery '' . 
a dominant motive be the poet 's longing for his homeland and its boyhood association : `` not man folk , but the field where i would stray , the stone where as a child i used_to play '' . 
he be utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory life he has been lead . 
what he really want be to find `` a sacred cause '' to which he can honestly devote himself . 
this restless individualism find its answer when he return to live nearly all the rest of his life in sweden . 
his cause be to commemorate the glory of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present . 
he did not , however , find_oneself at_once . 
his next major work , complete in 1892 , be a long fantastic epic in prose , entitle hans_alienus , which person ^ o ^ k describe as a monument on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth . 
the hero , who be himself , is represent as a pilgrim in the storied land of the east , a sort_of person type , who , to quote from person ^ o ^ k again , `` even in the pleasure garden of sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life . 
he is drive back by his yearning to the wintry homeland of his father in the forest of location '' . 
from this time on person proceed to find his deep self . 
by the death of his father in 1888 he had come_into possession of the family estate and had re-assume its tradition . 
he did not , however , settle back into acquiescence with thing as they be . 
like his friend and contemporary person he have little patience with collective mediocrity . 
he see sweden as a country of smug and narrow provincialism , indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory . 
person 's remedy for this condition be to tear_down the old structure and build anew from the ground up . 
person 's conception , on_the_contrary , be to revive the present by the memory of the past . 
whether in prose or poetry , all_of person 's later work be concerned with sweden . 
with the first of a group of historical novel , the_charles_men_(_karolinerna ) , publish in 1897_-_8 , he achieve the masterpiece of his career . 
in scope and power it can only be compare to person 's war_and_peace . 
about one-third as long , it be less intimate and detailed , but better coordinate , more concise and more dramatic . 
though it center around the brilliant and enigmatic figure of person , , the true hero be not finally the king himself . 
hence the title of the book , refer to the soldier and subject of the king ; on the fatal battlefield of location , to quote from the novel , `` the wreath he twine for himself slip down upon his people '' . 
the_charles_men consist_of not of a connected narrative but of a group of short_story , each depict a special phase of the general subject . 
somewhat uneven in interest for an average reader , eight or ten of these be among the finest of their kind in literature . 
they comprise a great variety of scene and interest : grim episode of war , idyllic interlude , superb canvas of world-shaking event , and delightfully humorous sketch of odd character . 
the general effect be tragic . 
almost nothing is say of person ' spectacular victory , the central theme be the heroic loyalty of the swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune and defeat . 
to carry_out this exalted conception the author has combine the vivid realism and imaginative power we have notice in his early poetry and carry_out them out on a grand scale . 
his peculiar gift , as had been suggest before , be his intensity . 
person has say that fervor be the core of style . 
of few author be this more true than of person . 
the_charles_men have a tremendous range of character , of common folk even more_than of major figure . 
the career of person , be obviously very similar to that of napoleon . 
his ideal be person , as napoleon 's be julius_caesar . 
his purpose , however , be not to establish an empire , but to assert the principle of divine justice . 
each aspire to be a god in human form , but with each it be a different kind of god . 
each fail catastrophically in an invasion of russia and each bring ruin on the country that worship him . 
each is still glorify as a national hero . 
the first half of the_charles_men , end on the climax of the battle of location in 1709 , be more dramatically coherent than the second . 
after the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerate for a time into a futility that be not merely pitiable but often ridiculous . 
like napoleon , he be the worst of loser . 
there be , however , some wonderful chapter at the beginning of the second part , concern the reaction of the swede in adversity . 
then more_than ever before did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness . 
this come_out in `` when_the_bells_ring '' , which describe the rallying of the peasant in southern sweden to repel an invasion by the dane . 
in `` the_king 's_ride '' , person break_out of a long period of petulance and inertia , regain his old self , escape from turkey , and finally reach his own land after an absence of eighteen year . 
he find it in utter misery and desolation . 
all his people ask for be no more war . 
but he plunge into yet another , this time with norway , and is kill in an assault on the fortress of location , being only thirty-six year of_age when he die . 
he had become king at fifteen . 
then suddenly there be a tremendous revulsion of popular feeling . 
from be a hated tyrant and madman he be now the symbol of all that be noble and best in the history of sweden . 
this is bring_out in the next-to-last chapter of the book , `` a_hero 's funeral '' , write in the form of an impassioned prose_poem . 
slowly the procession of warrior and statesman pass_through the snow beside the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral , the shrine of so many precious memory . 
the gun are fire , the hymn are sing , and the body of person is carry down to the vault and lay beside the tomb of his ancestor . 
as he had long to be , he become the echo of a saga . 
person write four other work of fiction about early figure revere in swedish memory . 
excellent in their way , they lack the wide appeal of the_charles_men , and need not detain us here . 
it be different with his volume the_swedes_and_their_chieftains ( svenskarna_och_deras_ho ^_vdingar ) , a history intend for the general reader and particularly suited for high_school student . 
admirably write , it be a perfect introduction to swedish history for reader of other country . 
some of the early episode have touch of the supernatural , as suit to the legendary background . 
these be suggestive_of person ^ f . 
especially touching be the chapter , `` the_little_sister '' , about a king 's daughter who become a nun in the convent of location . 
the record teem with romance and adventure . 
person be a superb example , and person , , the conqueror of denmark , hardly less so . 
of person and person , it be unnecessary to speak_of . 
today the private_detective will also investigate insurance_claim or handle divorce case , but his primary function remain what it has always be , to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not . 
it is from this unpromising background that the fictional private_detective was recruit . 
the mythological private_eye differ from his counterpart in real life in two essential way . 
on_the_one_hand , he does not work for a large agency , but be almost always self-employed . 
as a freelance investigator , the fictional detective be responsible to no person but himself and his client . 
for this reason , he appear as an independent and self-reliant figure , whose rugged individualism need not be press into the mold of a 9 to 5 routine . 
on_the_other_hand , the fictional detective does not break strike or handle divorce case ; no client would ever think_of ask him to do such thing . 
whatever his original assignment , the fictional private_eye end_up by investigate and solve a crime , usually a murder . 
operate as a one-man police_force in fact if not in_name , he be at_once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves . 
he catch criminal not merely because he is pay to do so ( frequently he does not receive a fee at_all ) , but because he enjoy his work , because he firmly believe that murder must be punish . 
thus the fictional detective be much more_than a simple businessman . 
he be , first_and_foremost , a defender of public morals , a servant of society . 
it is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which account_for the great appeal of the mythological detective . 
by_virtue_of his self-reliance , his individualism and his freedom from external restraint , the private_eye be a perfect embodiment of the middle_class conception of liberty , which amount to do what you please and let_the_devil_take_the_hindmost . 
at_the_same_time , because the personal code of the detective coincide with the legal dictate of his society , because he like to catch criminal , he be in middle_class eyes a virtuous man . 
in this way , the private_detective get the best of two possible world . 
he be an individualist but not an anarchist ; he be a public servant but not a cop . 
in_short , the fictional private_eye be a specialized version of person 's ideal entrepreneur , the man whose private ambition must always and everywhere promote the public welfare . 
in the mystery_story , as in the_wealth_of_nations , individualism and the social good be two side of the same benevolent coin . 
there is only one catch to this idyllic arrangement : 
person be wrong . 
not_only did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest number , he end by destroy himself , by give birth to monopoly capitalism . 
the rise of the giant corporation in western europe and the united_states date_from the period 1880 - 1900 . 
now , although the root of the mystery_story in serious literature go_back as far as balzac , person , and person , it was not until the closing decade of the 19th century that the private_detective become an established figure in popular fiction . 
sherlock_holmes , the ancestor of all private_eye , was bear during the 1890 s . 
thus the transformation of person 's ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincide closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life . 
drive from the marketplace by the course of history , our hero disguise himself as a private_detective . 
the birth of the myth compensate for the death of the ideal . 
even on the fictional level , however , the contradiction which give_rise to the mystery_story are not fully resolve . 
the individualism and public service of the private_detective both stem from his dedication to a personal code_of_conduct : he enforce the law without being tell to do so . 
the private_eye be therefore a moral man ; but his morality rest_on upon that of his society . 
the basic premise of all mystery_story be that the distinction between good and bad coincide with the distinction between legal and illegal . 
unfortunately , this assumption does not always hold good . 
as capitalism in the 20th century has become increasingly dependent upon force and violence for its survival , the private_detective is place in a serious dilemma . 
if he be good , he may not be legal ; if he be legal , he may not be good . 
it be the gradual unfolding and deepening of_this contradiction which create the inner dialectic of the evolution of the mystery_story . 
with the advent of person 's sherlock_holmes , the development of the modern private_detective begin . 
sherlock_holmes be not merely an individualist ; he be very close to be a mental_case . 
a brief list of the great detective 's little idiosyncrasy would provide person with ample food_for_thought . 
holmes be addicted to the use of cocaine and other refreshing stimulant ; he be prone to semi catatonic trance induce by the playing of the violin ; he be a recluse , an incredible egotist , a confirmed misogynist . 
holmes rebel against the social convention of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds . 
his eccentricity begin as a defense against boredom . 
it was in_order to avoid the stuffy routine of middle_class life that holmes become a detective in_the_first_place . 
as he inform person , `` my life is spend in one long effort to escape_from the commonplace of existence . 
these little problem help me to do so '' . 
holmes be a public servant , to_be_sure ; but the society which he serve bore him to tears . 
the curious relationship between holmes and scotland_yard provide an important clue to the deep significance of his eccentric behavior . 
although he be perfectly willing to cooperate with scotland_yard , holmes have nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality of the police . 
they for their part be convinced that holmes be too `` unorthodox '' and `` theoretical '' to make a good detective . 
why do the police find holmes `` unorthodox '' ? 
on_the_face_of_it , it is because he employ deductive technique alien to official police routine . 
another , more interesting explanation , is hint at by person when he observe on several occasion that holmes would have make a magnificent criminal . 
the great detective modestly agree . 
person 's insight is verify by the mysterious link between holmes and his arch opponent , person . 
the two man resemble each other closely in their cunning , their egotism , their relentlessness . 
the first series of sherlock_holmes adventure end with holmes and person grapple together on the edge of a cliff . 
they are presume to have plunge to a common grave in_this fatal embrace . 
link to holmes even in death , person represent the alter_ego of the great detective , the image of_what our hero might have become be he not a public servant . 
just as holmes the eccentric stand behind holmes the detective , so holmes the potential criminal lurk behind both . 
in the modern english `` whodunit '' , this insinuation of latent criminality in the detective himself has almost entirely disappear . 
person and person ( the respective creation of person and person ) have retain holmes ' egotism but not his zest for life and eccentric habit . 
person and his counterpart be perfectly respectable people ; it be true that they be also extremely dull . 
their dedication to the status_quo has been affirm at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism of a sherlock_holmes . 
the latter 's real descendent be unable to take_root in england ; they flee from the victorian parlor and make_one's_way their way across the stormy atlantic . 
in the american `` hard-boiled '' detective_story of the ' 20 s and ' 30 s , the spirit of the mad genius from location live on . 
like holmes , the american private_eye reject the social convention of his time . 
but unlike holmes , he feel his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt . 
surrounded by crime and violence everywhere , the `` hard-boiled '' private_eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed isolation . 
his alienation be far more acute than holmes ' ; he be not an eccentric but rather an outcast . 
with person 's person , alienation is represent on a purely physical plane . 
person refuse to ever leave his own house , and spend most_of his time drink beer and play with orchid . 
more profound and more disturbing , however , be the moral isolation of person 's person . 
in a society where everything be for_sale , person be the only man who cannot be buy . 
his tough honesty condemn him to a solitary and difficult existence . 
beaten , bruised and exhausted , he pursue the elusive killer through the demimonde of high_society and low morals , always alone , always despised . 
in_the_end , he get his man , but no one seem to care ; virtue be its own and only reward . 
a similar tone of underlying futility and despair pervade the spy thriller of person and dominate the most famous of all american mystery_story , person 's the maltese_falcon . 
person join_forces with a band of adventurer in search of a priceless jeweled statue of a falcon ; but when the bird is find at_last , it turn_out to be a fake . 
now the detective must save his own skin by inform on the girl he love , who be also the real murderer . 
for person , neither crime nor virtue pay ; moreover , it be increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two . 
because the private_eye intend to save society in_spite_of himself , he invariably find himself in_trouble with the police . 
the latter be either too stupid to catch the killer or too corrupt to care . 
in either case , they do not appreciate the private_detective 's zeal . 
person and person , person and person spend more time fight each other than they do in look_for the criminal . 
frequently enough , the police be themselves in_league_with the killer ; person 's red_harvest provide a classic example of_this theme . 
but even when the police be honest , they do not trust the private_eye . 
he be , like person , too alienated to be reliable . 
finally , in the maltese_falcon among others , the clash between detective and police is carry to its logical conclusion : person become the chief murder_suspect . 
in_order to exonerate himself , he is compel to find the real criminal , who happen to be his girlfriend . 
what be only a vague suspicion in the case of sherlock_holmes now appear as a direct accusation : the private_eye be in danger of turn_into his opposite . 
it is the growing contradiction between individualism and public service in the mystery_story which create this fatal dilemma . 
by uphold his own personal code_of_behavior , the private_detective has place himself in opposition to a society whose fabric be permeated with crime and corruption . 
that society respond by condemn the private_eye as a threat to the status_quo , a potential criminal . 
if the detective insist upon retain his personal standard , he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society . 
he must , in_short , cease to be a detective and become a rebel . 
on_the_other_hand , if he wish to continue in his chosen profession , he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism . 
person resolve this contradiction by cease to write mystery_story and turn_to other pursuit . 
his successor have adopt the opposite alternative . 
in_order to save the mystery_story , they have convert the private_detective into an organization man . 
the first of two possible variation on this theme is symbolize by person 's person . 
at_first_glance , this hero seem to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessor . 
for person , nothing be forbidden . 
he kill when he please , take his woman where he find them and always act_as judge , jury and executioner rolled_into_one . 
it will be show that the objective of the cooperative people in an organization determine the type of network require , because the type of network function according to the characteristic of the message enumerate in table 1 . 
great stress is place on the role that the monitoring of information send play in maintain the effectiveness of the network . 
by monitoring , we mean some system of control over the type of information send from the various center . 
as a word of caution , we should be aware that in actual practice no message be purely one of the four type , question , command , statement , or exclamation . 
for_example , suppose a man wear a $ 200 watch , drive a 1959 rolls_royce , stop to ask a man on the sidewalk , `` what time be it '' ? 
this sentence would have most_of the characteristic of a question , but it have some of the characteristic of a statement because the questioner has convey the fact that he have no faith in his own timepiece or the one attach to his car . 
if the man on the sidewalk is surprise at this question , it has serve as an exclamation . 
also , since the man question feel a strong compulsion to answer ( and thereby avoid the consequence of being think queer ) the question has assume some measurable property of a command . 
however , for convenience we will stick_to the idea that information can be classify according to table 1 . 
on this basis , certain extreme kind of network will be discuss for illustrative purpose . 
presumably a cocktail_party is expect to fulfill the host 's desire to get_together a number of people who be inadequately acquainted and thereby arrange for bring the level of acquaintance up to adequacy for future cooperative endeavor . 
the party be usually in a room small enough so that all guest be within sight and hearing of one another . 
the information is furnish by each of the guest , is send by oral broadcast over the air_wave , and is receive by the ear . 
since the air be a continuum , the network of communication remain intact regardless of the position or motion of the point ( the people ) in the net . 
as show in figure 1 , there be a connection for communication between every pair of point . 
this , and other qualification , make the cocktail_party the most complete and most chaotic communication_system ever dream_up . 
all four type of message list in table 1 are permit , although decorum and cocktail_party tradition require hold the command to a minimum , while exclamation have complimentary intonation are more_than customarily encourage . 
the completeness of the connection provide that , for n people , there be * * f line of communication between the pair , which can become a large_number ( 1225 ) for a party of fifty guest . 
look at the diagram , we see that * * f connection line come in to each member . 
thus the cocktail_party would appear to be the ideal system , but there be one weakness . 
in_spite_of the dream of the host for oneness in the group , the * * f incoming message for each guest overload his receiving_system beyond comprehension if n exceed about six . 
the crowd consequently break_up into temporary group range in size from two to six , with a half_life for the cluster range from three to twenty minute . 
for the occasion on which everyone already know everyone else and the host wish them to meet one or a_few honored newcomer , then the `` open_house '' system be advantageous because the honored guest be fixed connective point and the drifting guest make and break connection at the door . 
we consider a rural community as an assemblage of inhabited dwelling whose configuration is determine by the location and size of the arable land_site necessary for family subsistence . 
we assume for this illustration that the size of the land plot be so great that the distance between dwelling be greater than the voice can carry and that most_of the communication be between near neighbor only , as show in figure 2 . 
information beyond near neighbor is carry secondhand - , third - , and fourth hand as a distortable rumor . 
in figure 2 , the point in the network are designate by a letter accompany by a number . 
the number indicate the number of near neighbor . 
it will be note that point f have seven near neighbor , h and e have six , and p have only one , while the remaining point have intermediate number . 
in any social_system in which communication have an importance comparable_with that of production and other human factor , a point like f in figure 2 would ( other thing be equal ) be the dwelling place for the community leader , while e and h would house the next most important citizen . 
a point like p get information directly from n , but all information beyond n is indirectly relay through n . 
the dweller at p be last to hear about a new cure , the slow to announce to his neighbor his urgent distress , the one who go the farthest to trade , and the one with the great difficulty of all in put_over an idea or get people to join him in a cooperative effort . 
since the hazard of poor communication be so great , p can be justify as a habitable site only on the basis of unusual productivity such_as be make available by a waterfall for mill purpose , a mine , or a sugar_maple camp . 
location theorist have give these matter much consideration . 
the network for military communication be one of the best example of network which not_only must be change with the change in objective but also must be change with the addition of new machine of war . 
they also furnish proof that , in modern war , message sending must be monitor . 
without monitor , a military hookup become a noisy party . 
the need for monitor become greater when radio was adopt for military signaling . 
alexander_the_great , who use runner as message carrier , did not have to worry about have every officer in his command hear what he say and have hundred of them comment at_once . 
as time has pass and science has progress , the speed of military_vehicle has increase , the range of missile has been extend , the use of target-hunting nose on the projectile has been adopt , and the range and breadth of message send has increase . 
next to the old problem of the slowness of decision_making , network structure seem to be paramount , and without monitor no network have value . 
on the parade_ground the net may be similar to that show in figure 3 . 
the monitoring be the high and most restrictive of any organization in existence . 
no question , statement , or explanation are permit - only command . 
command go only from an officer to the man of near lower_rank . 
the same command is repeat as_many time as there be level in rank from general to corporal . 
all order originate with the officer of high rank and terminate with action of the man in the rank . 
even the officer in_charge , be it a captain ( for small display ) or a general , is restrain by monitor . 
this is do for simplicity of command and to bring the hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding have almost zero possibility . 
the command are specify by the military regulation ; be few in number , briefly word , all different in sound ; and be combinable into sequence which permit any march maneuver that could be desire on a parade_ground . 
this monitoring be necessary because , on a parade_ground , everyone can hear too_much , and without monitor a confused social_event would develop . 
with troops disperse on field_of_battle rather than on the parade_ground , it may seem that a certain amount of monitor is automatically enforce by the line of communication . 
years ago this be true , but with the replacement of wire or runner by radio and radar ( and perhaps television ) , these restriction have disappear and now again too_much is hear . 
in contrast to cocktail_party , military organization , even in the field , be more formal . 
in the extreme and oversimplified example suggest in figure 3 , the organization is more easily understand and more predictable in behavior . 
a military organization have an objective choose by the high command . 
this objective is adhere to throughout the duration of the action . 
the connective system , or network , is tailor to meet the requirement of the objective , and it be therefore not surprising that a military body act_as a single coordinated unit have a different communication network than a factory , a college , or a rural village . 
the assumption upon which the example show in figure 3 is base be : ( a ) one man can direct about six subordinate if the subordinate are choose carefully so that they do not need too_much personal coach , indoctrinate , etc. . 
( b ) a message run_a_risk too great a risk of being distort if it is to be relay more than about six consecutive time . 
( c ) decision of a general kind are make by the central command . 
and ( d ) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission is relegate to the line of man on the lower_rank . 
these assumption lead to an organization with one man at the top , six directly under him , six under each of these , and_so_on until there be six level of personnel . 
the number of people act_as one body by this scheme give a surprisingly large army of * * f 55987 man . 
this organizational network would be of no avail if there be no regulation pertaining to the type of message send . 
of type of message list in table 1 , command and statement be the only ones send through the vertical network show in figure 3 . 
a further regulation be that command always go_down , unaccompanied by statement , and statement always go_up , unaccompanied by command . 
question and , particularly , exclamation are usually channel along informal , horizontal line not indicate in figure 3 and seldom are carry beyond the near neighbor . 
it will readily be see that in this suggested network ( not materially different from some of the network in_vogue today ) greater emphasis on monitor is imply than is usually put into practice . 
furthermore , the network in figure 3 be only the basic net through which other network pertaining to logistics and the_like are interlace . 
not discuss here are some military problem of modern_times such_as undersea warfare , where the surveillance , sending , transmitting , and receiving be all so inadequate that network and decision_making be not the bottleneck . 
such problem be of extreme interest as well as importance and be so much like fight in a rain_forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to reexamine primitive conflict for what they could teach . 
this be an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigate , although one frequently hear the comment that we have insufficient specialist of the kind who can compete with the german or swiss , for_example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the finn in geochemistry . 
we hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalist who can see the overall picture and combine our national skill and knowledge for useful purpose . 
this problem of the optimum balance in the relative number of generalist and specialist can be investigate on a communicative network basis . 
since the difficulty of draw the net be great , we will merely discuss it . 
first , we realize that a pure specialist does not exist . 
but , for practical purpose , we have people who can be consider as such . 
for_example , there be person who be in physical_science , in the field of mineralogy , train in crystallography , who use only x_ray , apply only the powder_technique of x-ray_diffraction , to clay mineral only , and who have spend the last fifteen year concentrate_on the montmorillonites ; or person in the social_science in the field of anthropology , study the lung capacity of seven andean indian . 
so we see that a specialist be a man who know more and more about less and less as he develop , as contrast to the generalist , who know less and less about more and more . 
american democratic thought , point_up the relation between the protestant movement in_this country and the development of a social religion , which he call the american democratic faith . 
those familiar_with his work will remember that he place the incipience of the democratic faith at around 1850 . 
and he describe it as a balanced polarity between the notion of the free individual and what he call the fundamental_law . 
i want to say more about person 's so-called fundamental_law . 
but first i want to quote him on the relationship that he find between religion and politics in_this country and what happen to it . 
he point_out that from the time of person on through world_war_1 , , evangelical protestantism be a dominant influence in the social and political life of america . 
he term this early enthusiasm `` romantic_christianity '' and conclude that its similarity to democratic belief of_that day be so great that `` the doctrine of liberty seem but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical protestantism '' . 
let me quote him even more fully , for his analysis be important to my theme . 
he say : `` beside the protestant philosophy of progress , as express in radical or conservative millenarianism , should be place the doctrine of the democratic faith which affirm it to be the duty of the destiny of the united_states to assist in the creation of a better world by keep lighted the beacon of democracy '' . 
he specify , `` in the middle period of the nineteenth century it was color by christian supernaturalism , in the twentieth century it was affect by naturalism . 
but in every period it has be humanism '' . 
and let me add , utopianism , also . 
some fourteen or fifteen year ago , in an essay i call the leader_follows - where ? 
i use his polarity to illustrate what i think had happen to us in_that form of liberalism we call progressivism . 
it seem to me that the liberal had scrap the balanced polarity and repose both liberty and the fundamental_law in the common_man . 
that_is_to_say person 's fundamental_law had been so much modify by this time that it be neither fundamental nor law anymore . 
it be a weakness of person 's analysis that he never seem to realize that his so-called fundamental_law had already been cut loose from its foundation when it was adapt to democracy . 
and with progressivism the religion_of_humanity was replace what person call christian supernaturalism . 
and the common_man was develop mythic power , or charisma , on_his_own . 
during the decade that follow , the common_man , as that piece put it , grow uncomfortable as the voice of god and flee from behind person ) only to learn from science , to his shocked relief that after_all there be no god he had to speak_for and that he be just an animal anyhow - that there was a chemical_formula for him , and that too much could n't be expect of him . 
the socialism implicit_in the slogan of the roosevelt revolution , freedom from want and fear , seem a far cry from the individualism of the first_amendment to the constitution , or of the jacksonian frontier . 
what had happen to the common_man ? 
french egalitarianism had have only nominal influence in_this country before the day of popularism . 
the riotous onrush of industrialism after the war_for_southern_independence and the general secular drift to the religion_of_humanity , however , prepare the way for a reception of the french_revolution 's socialistic offspring of one sort of another . 
the first of_which to find important place in our federal_government be the graduated income_tax under person . 
moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920 s , the dislocation of the depression , the common ethos of materialism everywhere , all contribute in various way to the face_lifting that replace person and the great_gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy of the little_people . 
however , it be important to trace the philosophy of the french_revolution to its source to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence of the latter on the former . 
that john_locke 's philosophy of the social_contract father the american_revolution with its declaration_of_independence , i believe , we generally accept . 
yet , after rousseau had give the social_contract a new twist with his notion of the general will , the same philosophy , it may be say , become the idea source of the french_revolution also . 
the importance of rousseau 's twist has not always be clear to us , however . 
this notion of the general will give_rise to the commune_of_paris in the revolution and later bring napoleon to dictatorship . 
and it is clearly argue by person of newcastle , in his remarkable long essay , the heresy_of_democracy , and in a more general way by person , in his new_science_of_politics , that this same rousseauan idea , descend through european democracy , be the source of person 's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat . 
this be important to understand the position that doctrinaire liberal find themselves in after world_war_2 , and our great democratic victory that bring no peace . 
the long road that had take liberal in_this country into the social religion of democracy , into a worship of man , lead logically to the marxist dream of a classless society under a socialist state . 
and the ussr exist as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar . 
and by the time the war end , liberal leadership in_this country be spiritually marxist . 
we will recall that the still confident liberal of the person administration gather with other western utopian in san_francisco to set_up the legal framework , finally and at_last , to rationalize war - to rationalize want and fear - out of the world : the united_nations . 
we of the liberal led world get all set for peace and rehabilitation . 
then suddenly we find ourselves in the middle of another fight , an irrational , an indecent , an undeclared and immoral war with our strong ( and some had think noble ) ally . 
during the next five year the leaders of the fair_deal reluctantly back_down from the optimistic expectation of the new_deal . 
during the next five year liberal leaders in the united_states sink in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifest in a negative policy of containment - and the bitter irony - enforce and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we feel the greatest distaste for but could not abandon : 
the atom_bomb . 
in 1952 , it will be remember , the group without positive program campaign on the popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and win overwhelmingly . 
all_of this , i know , be recent history familiar to you . 
but i have be at some pains to review it as the drama of the common_man , to point_up what happen to him under person 's leadership . 
a perceptive journalist , person , has phrase it in the title of one of his book as the revolt of the moderate . 
he open his discourse , however , with a review of the person inaugural festivity at which a sympathetic press had assemble its massive talent , all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age . 
the show be colorful , indeed , exuberant , but the press for all its assiduity could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny . 
person offer his book as an explanation of why there was no clue . 
and i select this sentence as its pertinent summation : `` in_essence the drama of his ( person 's ) presidency can be describe as the ordeal of a nation turn conservative and struggle - thus_far with but limited and precarious success - to give effective voice and force to_that conservatism '' . 
i will assume that we be all aware of the continuing struggle , with its limited and precarious success , toward conservatism . 
it has move_on various level , it has be clamorous and confused . 
obviously there has be no agreement on what american conservatism be , or rather , what it should be . 
for it was neglect , not to say nascent , when the struggle begin . 
i see a piece the other day assail person , author of man_and_god_at_yale and publisher of the national_review , as no conservative at_all , but an old liberal . 
i would agree with this view . 
but i be not here to define conservatism . 
what i be here to do be to report on the gyration of the struggle - a struggle that amount to self redefinition - to see if we can predict its future course . 
one of the obvious conclusion we can make on the basis of the last election , i suppose , be that we , the majority , be dissatisfied with person conservatism . 
though , to_be_sure , we give person no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment . 
this be , however , symptomatic_of our national malaise . 
but before i try to diagnose it , i would offer other evidence . 
i will mention two volume of specific comment on this malaise that appear last year . 
the earlier of them be an unofficial enterprise , sponsor by life magazine , under the title of the national purpose . 
the contributor to this testament be all well-known : 
a former democratic candidate for president , a new_deal poet , the magazine 's chief editorial writer , two newspaper_columnist , head of a national broadcasting_company , a popular protestant evangelist , etc. . 
what i want to point_out here be that all_of them be ex liberal , or modified liberal , with perhaps one exception . 
i suppose we might classify person as an old liberal . 
and i would further note that they all - with one exception again - sing in one key or another the same song . 
its refrain be : `` let us return to the individualistic democracy of our forefather for our salvation '' . 
person express some reservation about this return . 
others invoke technology and common_sense . 
only person envision the possibility of our having `` outlive most_of what we used_to regard_as the program of our national purpose '' . 
but the most notable thing about the incantation of these ex liberal be that the onetime shibboleth of socialism be conspicuously absent . 
the second specific comment be the report of person 's commission_on_national_goals , titled goals_for_americans . 
they , perhaps , give the pitch of their position in the preface where it was say that person request that the commission be administer by the group , because it be nonpartisan . 
the commission seem to represent the viewpoint of_what i would call the unconscious liberal , but not unconscious enough , to invoke the now taboo symbolism of socialism . 
and here again we hear the same refrain mention above : `` the paramount goal of the united_states , set long_ago , was to guard the right of the individual , ensure his development , enlarge his opportunity '' . 
this group be secularist and their program tend to be technological . 
but it be the need to undertake these testament that i would submit here as symptom of the common_man 's malaise . 
and let me add person 's new book as another symptom of_it , particularly so in_view_of the attention time magazine give it when it come_out recently . 
person go_back to the declaration_of_independence , too , though i may add , with considerably more historical perception . 
i will reserve discussion of_it for a moment , however , to return to person . 
as symptomatic_of the common_man 's malaise , he be most significant : a liberal and a catholic , elect by the skin_of_his_teeth . 
does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy , not to say confused , state of the public mind ? 
what be the common_man 's complaint ? 
let 's take a panoramic look back over the course we have come . 
has not that way been light always by the lamp of liberalism up until the turning back under person ? 
and the basic character of_that liberalism has be spiritual rather than economic . 
person give it the name of protestant philosophy of progress . 
but there be a subjective side to_that utopian outlook . 
does our society have a runaway , uncontrollable growth of technology which may end our civilization , or a normal , healthy growth ? 
here there may be an analogy with cancer : we can detect cancer by their rapidly accelerating growth , determinable only_when related_to the more normal rate of healthy growth . 
should the accelerating growth of technology then warn us ? 
note such evidence be the first_step ; and almost the only `` cure '' be early detection and removal . 
one way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology would be to check the strength of our society 's organs to see if their functioning be as healthy as before . 
so an objective look at our present procedure may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation . 
in_any_event , whether society may have cancer , or merely a virus infection , the `` disease '' , we shall find , be political , economical , social , and even medical . 
have not our physical_ability already deteriorate because of the more sedentary life we are now live ? 
hence the prime issue , as i see it , be whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind , or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own need as a force of nature . 
we are already commit to establish man 's supremacy over nature and everywhere on earth , not merely in the limited social political economical context we be fond of today . 
otherwise , we go_on endlessly try to draw_the_line , color and other , as to which kind_of man we wish to see dominate . 
we have prove so able to solve technological problem that to contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else . 
we must believe we have the ability to affect our own destiny : otherwise why try anything ? 
so in these page the term `` technology '' is use to include any and all means which could amplify , project , or augment man 's control over himself and over other man . 
naturally this include all communication form , e.g. language , or any social , political , economic or religious structure employ for such control . 
properly mindful of all the culture in existence today throughout the world , we must employ these resource without war or violent revolution . 
if we were create a wholly new society , we could insist that our social , political , economic and philosophic institution foster rather than hamper man ; best growth . 
but we cannot start off with a clean_slate . 
so we must first analyze our present institution with_respect_to the effect of each on man 's major need . 
ask which institution most need correction , i would say the corporation as it exist in america today . 
at_first_glance this appear strange : of all people , was not america found by rugged_individualist who establish a new way_of_life still inspire `` undeveloped '' society abroad ? 
but hear person , former moscow correspondent of group , and author of `` to_moscow_-_and_beyond '' . 
in a book review of `` the_soviet_cultural_offensive '' , he say , `` long before the state_department organize its bureaucracy into an group in_order to wage a cultural counteroffensive within soviet border , the sharp cutting_edge of american culture had carve its mark across the russian steppe , as when the enterprising promoter of ' porgy_and_bess ' override the state_department to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare ' behind the enemy line . 
they be not diplomat or jazz_musician , or even organizer of reading_room and photomontage display , but rugged capitalist entrepreneur like henry_ford , person , person , the group , and person . 
their kind create an american culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrate russia as it do almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directive or program a series of consultation of interested agency . 
this favorable image of america in the mind of russian man and woman be still there despite years of energetic anti american propaganda '' . 
perhaps the public 's present attitude toward business stem from the fact that the `` rugged capitalist entrepreneur '' no_more exist in america . 
in his stead be a milquetoast version known_as `` the corporation '' . 
but even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristic in this new image of america , foreigner can ; and our loss of `` prestige '' abroad be the direct result . 
no amount of ballyhoo will cover_up the sordid fact . 
if we want respect from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it . 
first , let us realize that whatever good this setup achieve in earlier time , now the corporation per_se cannot take economic leadership . 
business must develop as a result of the idea , energy and ambition of an individual have purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind . 
when we `` force '' individual to assume the corporate structure by means of tax and other legal statute , we adopt what i would term `` pseudo capitalism '' and so take a major step toward socialism . 
the biggest loss , of_course , be the individual 's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy . 
socialism , i grant , have a definite place in our society . 
but let us not complain of the evil of capitalism by refer to a form that be not truly capitalistic . 
some form of capitalism do indeed work - superb organization , a credit to any society . 
but the pseudo capitalism which dictate our whole economy as_well as our politics and social life , will not stand close scrutiny . 
its pretense to operate in the public interest be little more than a sham . 
it serve only its own stockholder and poorly at that . 
as a creative enterprise , its ability be primarily in `` swallow '' creative enterprise develop outside its own organization ( an ability make possible by us , and almost mandatory ) . 
as to benefit to employee , it be notorious for its callous disregard except where it depend_on them for services . 
the corporation in america be in_reality our form of socialism , vie in_a_sense with the other socialistic form that has emerge within governmental bureaucracy . 
but while the corporation have all the disadvantage of the socialist form of organization ( so cumbersome it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status_quo ) , unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism , the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as_a_whole . 
so we are face with a vast network of amorphous entity perpetuate themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard_to the need of society , control society and force upon it a regime represent only the corporation 's need for survival . 
the corporation have a limited , specific place in our society . 
ideally speak , it should be allow to operate only where the public have a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the action of a single proprietor be secondary to the need of society . 
example be in public utility , make military aircraft and accessory , or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by_any_means other_than the corporate form , e.g. construct major airport or dam . 
thus , if corporation are not to run_away with us , they must become quasi governmental institution , subject_to public control and need . 
in all other area , private initiative of the `` proprietorship '' type should be urge to produce the desired goods and services . 
avoid runaway technology can be do only by assure a humane society ; and for this human_being must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rest . 
such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer , corporation cannot . 
it can project long-range goal for itself . 
corporation react violently to short-range stimulus , e.g. , quarterly and annual dividend report . 
proprietorship can establish a unity and integrity of control ; corporation , be more amorphous , cannot . 
proprietorship can establish a meaningful identity , represent a human personality , and thus establish sincere relationship with customer and community . 
corporation be apt by_nature to be impersonal , inhumane , shortsighted and almost exclusively profit motivated , a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public . 
the proprietor be able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate structure with its board_of_directors and stockholder . 
leadership be lacking in our society because it have no legitimate place to develop . 
man continuously at the head of grow enterprise can acquire experience of the most varied , complicated and trying type so that at maturation they have develop the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so sorely need now . 
hence government must establish great control upon corporation so that their activity promote what is deem essential to the national interest . 
proprietorship should get the tax_advantage now accrue to corporation , e.g. the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth . 
corporation should pay added tax , to be use for educational purpose ( not necessarily of the formal type ) . 
the right to leave legacy should be substantially reduce and ultimately eliminate . 
to perpetuate wealth control lead by small group of individual who play no role in its creation prevent those with real initiative from come_to_the_fore , and be basically anti democratic . 
when the proprietor die , the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquire by another proprietor or the government decide to drop it . 
strike should be declare illegal against corporation because disagreement would have to be settle by government representative act_as controller of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would now be define against proprietorship because employee and proprietor must be completely interdependent , as they be each a part of the whole . 
strike threaten the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship . 
certainly external force should not be apply arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so . 
if we cannot stop warfare in our own economic_system , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ? 
these proposal would go_far toward create the economic atmosphere favor growth of the individual , who , in_turn , would help us to cope_with runaway technology . 
individual human strength is need to pit against an inhuman condition . 
the battle be not easy . 
we are tempt to blame others for our problem rather than look them straight in the face and realize they be of_our_own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed , enlightened , competent leader . 
person develop in today 's corporation cannot hope to serve here - a judgment base on experience of my own in business and in activity outside . 
in my own company , in_effect a partnership , although legally a corporation , i have be able to do many thing for my employee which `` normal '' corporation of comparable size and nature would have be unable to do . 
also , i be convinced that if my company be a sole proprietorship instead of a partnership , i would have be even able to solve long-range problem for myself and my fellow employee . 
any ability i may have were achieve in their present shape from experience in share_in the growth and control of my business , couple with raise my family . 
this combined experience , on a foundation of very average , i assure you , intelligence and background , has help me do thing many well-informed people would bet heavily against . 
perhaps a list of some of the `` practice '' of my company will help here . 
the company grow out of effort by two completely inexperienced man in their late twenties , neither have a formal education applicable to , or experience in , manufacturing or selling our type of article . 
from an initial investment of $ 1200 in 1943 , it has grow , with no additional capital investment , to a present value estimate by some as exceed $ 10000000 ( we do n't disclose financial figure to the public ) . 
its growth continue steadily on a par with past growth ; and no limitation be in_evidence . 
our pin-curl clip and self-locking nut achieve dominance in just a_few year time , despite substantial , well established competition . 
during the last year of person 's administration , a red_scare develop in our country . 
many american react irrationally to the challenge of russia and turn_to the repression of idea by force . 
postmaster_general person set_about to protect the american people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the mail . 
attorney_general person make a series of raid that send more_than 4000 so-called radical to the jail , in direct violation of their constitutional right . 
then , not many year later , the group , under the leadership of person , pillory hundred of decent , patriotic citizen . 
anyone who try to remedy some of the most glaring defect in our form of democracy was denounce as a traitorous red whose real purpose be the destruction of our government . 
this hysteria reach its height under the leadership of person . 
demagogue of this sort find communist bogey lurk behind any new idea that would run counter to stereotyped notion . 
new idea be dangerous and must be repress , no_matter_how . 
those who would suppress dangerous thought , credit idea with high potency . 
they give strict interpretation to william_james ' statement that `` every idea that enter the mind tend to express itself '' . 
they seem to believe that a person will act automatically as_soon_as he contact something new . 
hence , the only defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion , unless it give evidence that it be perfectly safe . 
despite this danger , however , we are inform on every hand that idea , not machine , be our fine tool ; they be priceless even_though they cannot be record on a ledger page ; they be the most valuable of commodity - and the most salable , for their demand far exceed supply . 
so all-important be idea , we are tell , that person successful in business and happy in social life usually fall_into two class : those who invent new idea of their own , and those who borrow , beg , or steal from others . 
seemingly , with an unrestricted flow of idea , all will be well , and we are even assure that `` an idea a day will keep_away the sheriff away '' . 
that , however , may also bring the police , if the thinking does not meet with social approval . 
criminal , as_well_as model citizen , exercise their mind . 
merely have a mental_image of some sort be not the all-important consideration . 
of_course , there must be clarity : a single distinct impression be more valuable than many fuzzy ones . 
but clarity be not enough . 
the writer take a class of college_student to the state hospital for the mentally_ill in location , missouri . 
an inmate , a former university professor , expound to us , logically and clearly , that someone was pilfer his thought . 
he appeal_to us to bring his case to the attention of the authority that justice might be do_justice . 
despite the clarity of his presentation , his idea be not of einsteinian calibre . 
true , idea be important , perhaps life 's most precious treasure . 
but have we not go overboard in stress their significance ? 
have we not actually develop idea worship ? 
idea we must have , and we seek them everywhere . 
we scour literature for them ; here we find store the wisdom of great mind . 
but be all these work worthy of consideration ? 
can they stand rigid scrutiny ? 
shakespeare 's wit and wisdom , his profound insight into human nature , have stand the test of century . 
but be he infallible in all thing ? 
what of his treatment of the jew in the_merchant_of_venice ? 
shakespeare give us a vivid picture of person , but probably he never see a jew , unless in some of his travel . 
the jew had been banish from england in 1290 and were not permit to return before 1655 , when shakespeare had be dead for thirty-nine year . 
if any had escape expulsion by hide , they certainly would not frequent the marketplace . 
shakespeare did not usually invent the incident in his play , but borrow them from old story , ballad , and play , weave them together , and then breathe into them his spark of life . 
rather than from a firsthand study of jewish people , his delineation of person stem from a collection of italian story , il_pecorone , publish in 1558 , although write almost two century earlier . 
he could learn at second_hand from book , but could not thus capture the real jewish spirit . 
person , in shaking_the_dust_from_shakespeare ( 216 ) , write : `` there is not a word speak by person which one would expect from a real jew '' . 
he take the story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone . 
the jew be the safe victim . 
no jew be on_hand to boycott his financially struggling theater . 
it would have be unwise policy , for_instance , to apply the pound of flesh characterization to the thrifty scotchman . 
just as now anyone may hurl insult at a citizen of mars , or even of location , and no senatorial investigation will result . 
who care about them ! 
shakespeare does not tell us that person be an aberrant individual . 
he set_forth him forth as be typical of the group . 
he tell of his `` jewish heart '' - not a shylockian heart ; but a jewish heart . 
this would make anyone crafty and cruel , capable of fiendish revenge . 
there be no justification for such misrepresentation . 
if living jew be unavailable for study , the bible be at_hand . 
read the old_testament would have show the dramatist that the idea attribute to person be abhorrent to the jew . 
be we better_off for have shakespeare 's idea of person ? 
study the_merchant_of_venice in high_school and college has give many young people their notion about jew . 
does this help the non-jew to understand this group ? 
person , inquisitor-general of the group , put_to_death many person to death . 
his name become synonymous with cold-blooded cruelty . 
would we gain by keep alive his memory and besmirch today 's roman_catholic by say he have a catholic heart ? 
let his bone and his memory rest in the fifteenth century where they belong ; he be out_of_place in our times . 
shakespeare 's person , too , be of dubious value in the modern_world . 
idea , in and of themselves , be not necessarily the greatest good . 
a successful businessman recently preface his address to a luncheon group with the statement that all economist should be send to the hospital for the mentally deranged where they and their theory might rot together . 
will his words come to be treasure and quote through the year ? 
frequently we are give assurance that automatically all idea will be sift and resift and in_the_end only the good ones will survive . 
but be that not like go_to a chemistry_laboratory and blindly pour_out liquid and powder from an array of bottle and then , after stir , expect a new wonder_drug inevitably to result ? 
what of the efficiency of this natural instrument of free discussion ? 
be there some magic in it that assure result ? 
when person ( pride_of_palomar , 43 ) inform us in 1921 that we have an instinctive dislike for the japanese , did the heated debate of the californian settle the truth or falsity of the proposition ? 
the leopard 's_spots come from the pen of person in 1902 , and in_this he announce an `` unchangeable '' law . 
if a child have a single drop of negro blood , he would revert to the ancestral line which , except as slave under a superior race , had not make one step of progress in 3000 year . 
that doctrine has been accept by many , but has it produce good result ? 
in the same vein , a certain short_story plot has been overwork . 
the son and heir of a prominent family marry a girl who have telltale shadow on the half-moon of her fingernail . 
in_time she present her aristocratic husband with a coal-black child . 
be the world better for having this idea thrust upon it ? 
will argument and debate decide its truth or falsity ? 
for answer to such question we must turn_to the anthropologist , the biologist , the historian , the psychologist , and the sociologist . 
long_ago they consign the notion of person and person to the scrapheap . 
false idea surfeit another sector of our life . 
for several generation much fiction has appear deal with the steprelationship . 
the stepmother , almost without exception , has been present as a cruel ogress . 
child , condition by this mistaken notion , have fear stepmother , while adult , by their antagonistic attitude , have make the role of the substitute parent a difficult one . 
debate be not likely to resolve the tension and make the lot of the stepchild a happy one . 
research , on_the_other_hand , has show many stepmother to be eminently successful , some far better than the real mother . 
person inform us ( the_psychology_of_women , vol. 2 , , 434 ) that in all culture `` the term ' stepmother ' automatically evoke deprecatory implication '' , a conclusion accept by many . 
will mere debate on that proposition , even_though it be free and untrammeled , remove the dross and leave a residue of refined gold ? 
that be questionable , to say the least . 
research into several culture has prove her position to be a mistaken one . 
most assuredly idea be invaluable . 
but idea , just for the sake of have them , be not enough . 
in the 1930 's , cure for the depression literally flood washington . 
for a time the president receive hundred of them every_day , most_of them worthless . 
idea need to be test , and not merely by argument and debate . 
when some question arise in the medical field concern cancer , for_instance , we do not turn_to free and open discussion as in a political_campaign . 
we have recourse to the scientifically trained specialist in the laboratory . 
the merit of the person anti polio vaccine were not establish on the forensic platform or in newspaper editorial , but in the laboratory and by test in the field on thousand of child . 
our presidential campaign provide much debate and argument . 
but be the result new barnful of tested knowledge on the basis of which we can with_confidence solve our domestic and international problem ? 
man , we are tell , be endowed with reason and be capable of distinguish good from bad . 
but what a super herculean task it be to winnow anything of value from the mud-beplastered argument use so freely , particularly since such common use is make of cliche and stereotype , in themselves declaration of intellectual bankruptcy . 
we are remind , however , that freedom_of_thought and discussion , the unfettered exchange of idea , be basic under our form_of_government . 
assuredly in our political_campaign there be freedom to think , to examine any and all issue , and to speak without restraint . 
no_holds_are_barred . 
but have the result be heartening ? 
may we state with_confidence that in such an exhibition a republic will find its greatest security ? 
we must_not forget , to_be_sure , that free discussion and debate have produce beneficial result . 
in_truth , we can say that this break the power of person , who was finally expose in full light to the american people . 
if he had been `` liquidate '' in_some_way , he would have become a martyr , a rallying_point for people who share his idea . 
debate in the political_arena can be productive of good . 
but it be a clumsy and wasteful process : it can produce negative result but not much that be positive . 
debate rid us of person but did not give us much that be positive . 
it do something to clear the ground , but it erect no striking new structure ; it did not even provide the architect 's plan for anything new . 
in the field of the natural_science , scientifically verify data be quite readily available and any discussion can be shorten with good result . 
in the field of the social_science a considerable fund of tested knowledge has been accumulate that can be use to good advantage . 
by_no_means would we discourage the production of idea : they provide raw_material with which to work ; they provide stimulation that lead to further production . 
we would establish no censorship . 
important as be person 's essay , his thesis be so restricting as to deny person the stature which he obviously have . 
he and also person and person have fall to the temptation which beset many_of us to read into our author - person , for_example , and herman_melville - protest against modernism , material progress , and science which be genuine protest of our own but may not have be theirs . 
person 's total work today , and in_fact those of his work which exist in 1946 when person made his comment , or in 1939 , when person write his essay , reveal no such simple attitude toward the south . 
if he be a traditionalist , he be an eclectic traditionalist . 
if he condemn the recent or the present , he condemn the past with no less force . 
if he see the heroic in a person or a person , he see also - and he show - the blind and the mean , and he see the person family disintegrate from within . 
if the barnburner 's family produce a person , who personify commercialism and materialism in hyperbolic crassness , the person family produce a person 4 , . 
person be a most untraditional traditionalist . 
others write_on person have find the phrase `` traditional moralist '' either inadequate or misleading . 
among them be person , person , and person . 
they have indicate the direction but they have not be explicit enough , i believe , in point_out person 's independence , his question if not indeed challenge the southern tradition . 
person 's be not the mind of the apologist which person imply that it be . 
he be not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social , cultural , or literary tradition than he be within the tradition - or possibly the regulation - govern his tenure in the post_office at location , mississippi , thirty-five year ago . 
that be not to deny that he has be aware of tradition , of_course , that he is steep in them , in_fact , or that he has deal with them , in his book . 
it be to say rather , i believe , that he has bring_to_bear on the history , the tradition , and the lore of his region a critical , skeptical mind - the same mind which has make of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique . 
he has employ from his section rich immediate material which in a loose sense can be term southern . 
the fact that he has cast over those material the light of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less southern , i rather think , for the south has be no_more solid than other region except in the political and related area where patronage and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity . 
some of us might be inclined to argue , in_fact , that an independence of mind and action and an intolerance of regimentation , either mental or physical , be particularly southern trait . 
there be no necessity , i suppose , to assert that person be southern . 
it would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly southern pedigree than that of his family . 
and , after_all , he has live comfortably at both location , mississippi , and location , virginia . 
the young person in new_orleans in the 1920 's impress the novelist person as obviously conscious of be a southerner , and there be no evidence that since then he has ever consider himself any less so . 
besides show no inclination , apparently , to absent himself from his native region even for short period , and in_addition write a shelf of book set in the region , he has handle in those book an astonishingly complete list of matter which have be important in the south during the past hundred year . 
it be more difficult with person than with most author to say what be the extent and what be the source of his knowledge . 
his own testimony be that he has read very little in the history of the south , imply that what he know of that history has come to him orally and that he know the world around him primarily from his own unassisted observation . 
his denial of extensive reading notwithstanding , it be no_doubt safe to assume that he has spend time school himself in southern history and that he has gain some acquaintance with the chief literary author who have live in the south or have write_about the south . 
to believe otherwise would be unrealistic . 
but in look_at person against his background in mississippi and the south , it be important not to lose the broad perspective . 
his earliest work reflect heavy influence from english and continental writer . 
evidence be plentiful that early and later also he has be indebted to the gothic_romancer , who deal in extravagant horror , to the symbolist write at the end of the preceding century , and in_particular to the stream_of_consciousness novelist , henry_james and person among them . 
his repeated experimentation with the technique of fiction testify to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also show him touch at many point the stream of literary development back of him . 
my intention , therefore , be not to say that person 's awareness has been confine within the border of the south , but rather that he has look_at his world as a southerner and that presumably his outlook be southern . 
the ingredient of person 's novel and story be by_no_means new with him , and most_of the problem he take_up have have the attention of author before him . 
a useful comment on his relation to his region may be make , i think , by note briefly how in handle southern material and southern problem he has deviate from the pattern set by other southern author while remain faithful to the essential character of the region . 
the planter aristocracy has appear in literature at_least since person publish swallow-barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of person preside over his plantation dominion initiate the most persistent tradition of southern literature . 
the thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the civil_war when southern writer be eager to defend a way_of_life which had been destroy . 
as they look with_nostalgia to a society which had been sweep_away , they be probably no_more than half conscious that they painted_in_colors which had never exist . 
their book find no less willing reader outside than inside the south , even while memory of the war be still sharp . 
the tradition reach its apex , perhaps , in the work of person toward the end of the century , and reappear undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel so_red_the_rose , by person . 
although person be the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have person 's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society . 
the myth of the southern plantation has have only a tangential relation with actuality , as person show forty year ago , and i suspect it has have a far narrow acceptance as something real than has generally been suppose . 
person has find it useful , but he has employ it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook . 
without say or seem to say that in portray the person and the person family person 's chief concern be social criticism , we can say nevertheless that through those family he dramatize his comment on the planter dynasty as they have exist since the decade before the civil_war . 
it may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard , for the treatment in his book be far removed from even the genial irony of person , who be the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of planter society . 
person 's low-class character have but few counterpart in earlier southern novel deal with plantation life . 
they have an ancestry extend back , however , at_least to 1728 , when person describe the person he encounter in the back_country of virginia and north_carolina . 
the chief literary antecedent of the person clan appear in the realistic , humorous writing which originate_in the south and the southwest in the three decade before the civil_war . 
these narrative of coarse action and crude language appear first in local newspaper , as a rule , and later find their way between book cover , though rarely into the planter ' library beside the morocco bound volume of person , person , person , and person . 
there be evidence to suggest , in_fact , that many author of the humorous sketch were prompt to write them - or to make them as indelicate as they be - by way of protest against the artificial refinement which had come to dominate the polite letters of the south . 
person , sturdy realist that he be , plead for a natural robustness such_as he find in his favorite the great elizabethan , to vivify the pale writing being produce around him . 
person admire the raucous tale emanate from the backwoods , but he have himself social affiliation which would not allow him to approve them fully . 
person , a preacher and a college and university president in four southern state , publish the early of these backwoods sketch and in the character person , in the account of sharp horse_trading and eye gouge physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his character , he set an example follow by many after him . 
others who write_of low character and low life include person , creator of the person of arkansas and person , the person ; person , whose character person bear a close kinship to person in both his willingness to take_advantage cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carry_out his will ; and person , whose tennessee hillbilly character person perpetrate more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature . 
it would be profitable , i believe , to read these realistic humorist alongside person 's work , the thought be not that he necessarily read them and owe anything to them directly , but rather that they deal a_hundred year ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continue down to our time , to person 's time . 
such a comparison remind us that in employ low character in his work person is record actuality in the south and moreover is follow a long established literary precedent . 
such character , with their low existence and often low morality , produce humorous effect in his novel and tale , as they did in the writing of person and person and person , but it need not be add that he give them far subtle and more intricate function than they have in the earlier writer ; nor is there need to add that among them be some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his character . 
one of the early humorist already mention , person , can be use to illustrate another point where person touch authentic southern material and also earlier literary treatment of those material . 
person come to louisiana from the east as a young man prepare to find in the new country the setting of romantic adventure and idealized beauty . 
but person see also the hardship of pioneer existence , the cultural poverty of the frontier_settlement , and the slack morality which abound in the new region . 
as a consequence of the tension thus produce in his thought and feelings , he write on_the_one_hand sketch of idealized hunting trip and on_the_other_hand an anecdote of the village of location , arkansas , where no one had ever see a piano ; and he write also the masterpiece of frontier humor , `` the_big_bear_of_arkansas '' , in which earthy realism is place alongside the exaggeration of the backwoods tall_tale and the awe with which man contemplate the grandeur and the mystery of nature . 
person 's feeling_of_identity with person was crown by her discovery of the coincidence that person 's epitaph in the jewish cemetery in venice refer to her as `` the sulamite '' . 
into the texture of this tapestry of history and human drama person , as every artist delight to do , weave strand of her own intuitive insight into human nature and - especially in the remarkable story of the attraction and conflict between two so disparate and fervent character as this pair - into the relations of man and woman : `` in their relations , she be the giver and he the receiver , nay the demander . 
his feeling always exact sacrifice from her . 
one be so accustomed to think_of man as the privileged who need but ask and receive , and woman as submissive and yielding , that our sympathy are usually enlist on the side of the man whose love is not return , and we condemn the woman as a coquette . 
the very firmness of her conviction and logical clearness of her argument captivate and stimulate him to make greater effort ; usually , this be most exasperating to man , who expect every woman to verify their preconceived_notion concern her sex , and when she does not , immediately condemn her as eccentric and unwomanly . 
she have the opportunity that few clever woman can resist , of show her superiority in argument over a man . 
woman themselves have come to look_upon matter in the same light as the outside world , and scarcely find any wrong in submit to the importunity of a strong will , even when their affection are withhold . 
she was expose herself to temptation which it be best to avoid where it can consistently be done . 
one who invite such trial of character be either foolhardy , overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith in mankind to see the danger . 
in any case but the last , such a course be sure to avenge itself upon the individual ; the moral power no more than the physical and mental , can bear overstrain . 
and , in the last case , a bitter disappointment but too often meet the confiding nature '' . 
person was discover in the process of write , as the born writer does , not merely a channel for the discharge of accumulate information but a stimulus to the development of the creative power of observation , insight and intuition . 
person be so pleased with the quality of her biographical study of person that he consider submit it to the century_magazine or harper 's but he decide that its jewish subject probably would not interest them and publish it in the_messenger , `` so our reader will be benefit instead '' . 
under her father 's influence it did not occur to person that she might write_on subject outside the jewish field , but she did begin write for other anglo-jewish paper and thus increase her output and her audience . 
and she write the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of person perform at the hanukkah festival which come in december . 
by her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing be so evident that papa and mamma give her a life_of_dickens as a spur to her aspiration . 
another source of intellectual stimulus was open to her at that time by the founding of group within walk distance of home . 
it was establish in a_couple_of building in the shopping district , with only a_few professor , but all eminent man , and a_few hundred eager student house in nearby dwelling . 
in september ' 76 person , darwin 's famous disciple , come from england to speak in a crowded auditorium at the formal opening of the university ; and although it be a school for man only , it afford person an opportunity to attend its public_lecture . 
in the following year her father undertake to give a course in hebrew theology to group student , and this bring to the person house a group of bright young jew who had come to baltimore to study , and who enjoy being feed and mother by mamma and entertain by person and person , who play and sing for them in the upstairs sitting_room on sunday evening . 
from philadelphia come person and person . 
person , person 's nephew , come to study assyriology . 
a smart , shrewd and ambitious young man , well connected , and with a knack for get in the good grace of important people , he be bound to go_far . 
person , the younger son of the distinguished rabbi , person , be a friendly , round-faced fellow with a little mustache , whose field be psychology , and who be also a punster and a jolly tease . 
his father be a good friend of person , and person live with the person for_a_while . 
both these youth , who greatly admire person , be somewhat young than she , as be also the neighboring person boy , who were then study medicine ; and bright though they all be , they could not possibly compete for her interest with papa , whose mind - although he never try to dazzle or patronize lesser light with it - naturally eclipse theirs and make them seem to her even young than they be . 
besides , person - as she be generally known since she had put up her hair with a chignon in the back - have little time to spare them from her teaching and writing ; so person become interested in her friend person , and person - the only young_man who when he write have the temerity to address her as person , and sign himself person - fall_in_love with pretty sister person . 
person , however , was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with person 's old and more serious brother , person , who be just_about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trip to philadelphia with papa , when he substitute for person at group there during its rabbi 's absence in europe . 
young person , who , while attend the group , also teach and edit a paper , find time to write person twenty page letter on everything that engage his interest , from the acting of person in philadelphia to his reaction to the comment of `` person '' on the jewish reform_movement being promulgate by the group in cincinnati . 
unlike his young brother , person , he never presume_to address her more familiarly than as `` my dear friend '' , although he praise and envy the elegance and purity of her style . 
and when he complain of the lack of time for all he wanted to do , person advise him to rise at five in the morning as she and papa did . 
one thing papa had not teach person was how to handle a young_man as high-spirited and opinionated as herself . 
she could not resist the opportunity `` of show her superiority in argument over a man '' which she had remark as one of the `` feminine folly '' of person ; and in her forthright way , person , who in her story of person had indicate her own unwillingness `` to think_of man as the privileged '' and `` woman as submissive and yielding '' , feel obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which person take_exception the slightest exception - he object to her stand on the person affair , as_well_as on the radical reform of person of group - until once , in sheer desperation , he write that he had give_up hope they would ever agree on anything . 
but that did not prevent him from write more long letter , or from come to spend his christmas vacation with the hospitable , lively person in their pleasant house on location . 
`` we 've have_got father and mother and each_other , '' say person on the first page of person 's little_women ; and , `` i do think that family be the most beautiful thing in all the world '' , burst_out person some five_hundred page later in that popular story of the person family , which had first appear when person be eight ; and the person family , as it develop , bear a striking resemblance to the person . 
person , like person , be a clergyman , although of an indeterminate denomination ; and `` marmee '' person , like person , be the competent manager of her brood of girl , of whom the person have only four to the person ' five . 
but the person girl have their counterpart in the person girl . 
person could easily identify herself with person , although person be not the eldest sister . 
neither be person hoydenish like person , who frankly wish she be a boy and had deliberately shorten her name , which , like person 's , be the feminine form of a boy 's name . 
but both be high-spirited and vivacious , both have temper to control , both love language , especially english and german , both be good teacher and write for publication . 
each be her mother 's assistant and confidante ; and each stand_out conspicuously in the family picture . 
person be more like person , the eldest person girl , who `` learn that a woman 's happy kingdom be home , her highest honor the art of rule it , not as a queen , but a wise wife and mother '' . 
person , blue-eyed like mamma , be from the start her mother's_daughter 's daughter , destine for her mother 's role in life . 
person , like person , suffer ill_health - get rheumatic_fever and had to be careful of her heart - but that never dampen her spirit . 
when her right_hand was incapacitate by the rheumatism , person learn to write with her left_hand . 
she write gay play about the girl for family entertainment , like `` oh_,_what_fun ! 
a comedy in three act '' , in which , under `` personage '' , person appear as `` a schoolmarm '' , and person , who be only a_trifle less brilliant in high_school than person had be , appear as `` person '' . 
person study piano ; play chopin in the `` soiree_musicale of person 's pupil '' ; and she recite `` hector 's_farewell_to_andromache '' most movingly , to the special delight of person at his home in location near philadelphia , where the person girl take_turns visit between the visit of the person boy at the person ' in baltimore . 
person , like person , the young of the person , be the rebellious , mischievous , rather calculating and ambitious one . 
for person , concede to be the pretty of the person girl - and she did make a pretty picture sit in the grape_arbor strum her guitar and sing in her silvery tone - there be no particular person counterpart ; but both group be so closely_knit that despite individual difference the family life in both case be remarkably similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content - the one be definitely jewish and the other vaguely christian . 
the person , like the person , enjoy and love live together , even in troubled times ; and , as in the person home , any young_man who call on the person find himself confront with a phalanx of femininity which make it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them . 
this include mamma , jolly , generous , and pretty , with whom they all fall_in_love , just as papa had first fall_in_love with her mamma before he choose her ; and when a young_man like person had enjoy the person hospitality , he feel obliged to send his respects and his gift not merely to person , in whom he be really interested , but to all the person girl and mamma . 
and just as `` person '' person was first attract to bright person , who find him immature by her high standard , and_then had to content himself with her younger sister person , so person , who had also been write person before he come to group , had_to content himself with her younger sister , pretty person . 
and like person , who see her sister person and person involved in `` lovering '' before herself , person see her sister person and person draw outside their family circle by the attraction of suitor , person by person , and person by person , a young businessman who would write her romantic description of his trip by steamboat down the mississippi . 
when person return to california in the winter of 1944 , it was to take_up again a collaboration with person , begin some year before . 
the film they do after his return be an inconsequential bit of nothing titled out_of_this_world , a satire on the person bobbysoxer craze . 
the twist lie in use person 's voice on the soundtrack while leading_man person mouth the words . 
if nothing else , at_least two good song come_out of the project , `` out_of_this_world '' and `` june_comes_around_every_year '' . 
though they would produce some very memorable and lasting song , person and person were not give strong material to work_on . 
their first collaboration come close . 
early in 1941 they were assign to a script titled hot_nocturne . 
it purport to be a reasonably serious attempt at a treatment of jazz_musician , their aim , their problem - the tug-of-war between the `` pure '' and the `` commercial '' - and seem a promising vehicle , for the two man share a common interest in jazz . 
person practically grow_up with the sound of jazz and the blues in his ear . 
he be_born in savannah , georgia , in 1909 . 
his father , person , was descend from an honored southern family that could trace its ancestry back to one person , who had emigrate from scotland in 1747 . 
the lyricist 's father be a lawyer who had branch_out into real_estate . 
his second wife , person , be the mother of person . 
by the age of six young person indicate that he had the call . 
one day he follow the_irish_jasper_greens , the town band , to a picnic and spend the entire day listen , while his family spend the day look . 
the disappearance cause his family to assign a full-time maid to keep_an_eye_on the boy . 
but one afternoon person meet her ; both be obviously on_the_way to the person home . 
the mother inquire , `` where 's person , and why did you leave him '' ? 
`` there be nothing else i could do '' , the maid answer , satisfied with a rather vague explanation . 
but person demand more . 
the maid then tell her , `` because he fire me '' . 
with her son evidence so strong a musical bent his mother could do little else but get him start on the study of music - though she wait until he be ten - begin with the piano and follow that with the trumpet . 
young person show a remarkable lack of aptitude for both instrument . 
still , he did like music making and even sing in the chapel choir of the group , near location , virginia , where he sound fine but did not matriculate too well . 
when he be fifteen person turn_out his first song , a jazzy little thing he call `` sister_susie , strut_your_stuff '' . 
if his scholarship and formal musicianship be not all they might have be , person demonstrate at an early age that he was gift with a remarkable ear for rhythm and dialect . 
from his playmate in location , person had pick_up , along with a soft southern dialect , trace also of the location dialect of africa . 
such speech difference make him acutely aware of the richness and expressiveness of language . 
during the summer , while he be still in school , person work for his father 's firm as a messenger_boy . 
it generally take well into the autumn for the firm to recover from the summer 's help . 
`` we 'd give him thing to deliver , letter , check , deed and thing like that '' , remember his half-brother person , still in the real_estate business in savannah , `` and learn day later that he 'd absentmindedly stuff them into his pocket . 
there they stay '' . 
this rather detached attitude toward life 's encumbrance has seem to be the dominant trait in person 's personality ever since . 
it be , however , a disarming disguise , or perhaps a shield , for not_only has person prove himself to be one of the few great lyricist over the year , but also one who can function remarkably under pressure . 
he has also enjoy a successful career as an entertainer ( his record have sell in the million ) and be a sharp businessman . 
he have also an extraordinary conscience . 
in 1927 his father 's business collapse , and , rather_than go bankrupt , person senior turn_over his firm over to a bank for liquidation . 
he die before he could completely pay_off his debt . 
some year later the bank handle the person liquidation receive a check for $ 300000 , enough to clear_up the debt . 
the check had been mail from chicago , the envelope bear no return_address , and the check be not signed . 
`` that 's person '' , sigh the bank president , `` the best hearted boy in the world , but absentminded '' . 
but person 's explanation be simple : `` i make_out the check and carry it around a_few day unsigned - in_case i lose it '' . 
when he remember that he might have not sign the check , person make_out another for the same amount , instruct the bank to destroy the other - especially if he had happened_to have absentmindedly sign both of them . 
when the family business fail , mercer leave school and on his mother 's urging - for she hope that he would become an actor - he join a local little theater group . 
when the troupe travel_to new_york to participate in a one act play competition - and win - person , instead of return with the rest of the company in triumph , remain in new_york . 
he had talk_into one other member of the group to stay with him , but that friend had tire of not eat regularly and return to savannah . 
but person hang_on , live , after_a_fashion , in a greenwich_village fourth flight walk-up . 
`` the place have no sink or washbasin , only a bathtub '' , his mother discover when she visit him . 
`` person insist on cook a chicken dinner in my honor - he 's always be a good cook - and i 'll never forget him clean the chicken in the tub '' . 
a story , no_doubt apocryphal , for person himself deny it , have him sport a monocle in those village day . 
though merely clear glass , it be a distinctive trademark for an aspiring actor who hope to imprint himself upon the memory of producer . 
one day in a bar , so the legend go , someone put a beer stein with too much force on the monocle and break it . 
the innocent malfeasant , filled with that supreme sense of honor find in bar , insist upon replace the destroyed monocle - and did , over the protest of the former owner - with a square monocle . 
person is_supposed_to have refuse it with , `` anyone who wear a square monocle must be affected '' ! 
person , then assistant director for the garrick_gaieties , a group production , need a lyricist for a song he had write ; he just happened not to need any actor at the moment , however . 
for him person produce the lyric to `` out_of_breath_scared_to_death_of_you '' , introduce in that most successful of all the gaieties , by person . 
this 1930 edition also have song in it by person and person , by person and person , and by person . 
entrance into such stellar song write company encourage the burgeon songwriter to take a wife , person , a dancer in the gaieties . 
the person take_up residence in brooklyn , and person find a regular job in wall_street `` misplace stock and bond '' . 
when he hear that person was look_for singer to replace the rhythm_boys , person apply and get the job , `` not for my voice , i 'm sure , but because i could write song and material generally '' . 
while with the person band person meet person . 
he had yet to meet person , for although they had `` collaborate '' on `` satan 's li ' l lamb '' , person and person had work from a lead_sheet the composer had furnish them . 
the lyric , person remember , was tailor to fit the unusual melody . 
person 's person association bring him into contact with person , whose `` snowball '' person relyric as `` lazybones '' , in which form it become a hit and mark the real beginning of person 's song write career . 
after leave person , person join the person band as a vocalist . 
with the help of person , also in the band , he transform a traditional jewish melody into a popular song , `` and_the_angels_sing '' . 
the countrywide success of `` lazybones '' and `` and_the_angels_sing '' could only lead to hollywood , where , besides person , person collaborate with person , person , person , person , person , and person . 
person has also write both music and lyric for several song . 
he may be the only songwriter ever to have collaborate with a secretary of the group ; he collaborate on a song with person , who be secretary of the treasury , 1932 - 33 . 
when person and person begin their collaboration in 1940 , person , like person , have several substantial film song to his credit , among them `` hooray_for_hollywood '' , `` ride , tenderfoot , ride '' , `` have_you_got_any_castles , baby ? '' 
, and `` too_marvelous_for_words '' ( all with person ) ; with person he do `` the_girl_friend_of_the_whirling_dervish '' , `` jeepers creepers '' , and `` you_must_have_been_a_beautiful_baby '' . 
person 's lyric are characterize by an unerring ear for rhythmic nuance , a puckish sense_of_humor express in language with a colloquial flair . 
though versatile and capable of turn_out a ballad lyric with the best of them , person 's forte be a highly polished quasi folk wit . 
his casual , dreamlike work method , often as not in_absentia , be an abrupt change from person 's , so that person had_to adjust again to another approach to collaboration . 
there be time that he work with both lyricist simultaneously . 
speak of his work with person , person say , `` our work habit be strange . 
after we get a script and the spot for the song were block_out , we 'd get_together for an hour or_so every_day . 
while person make himself comfortable on the couch , i 'd play the tune for him . 
he have a wonderfully retentive memory . 
after i would finish play the song , he 'd just go_away without a comment . 
i would n't hear from him for a_couple_of week , then he 'd come around with the completed lyric '' . 
person be one of the few ( possibly the only ) composer person has be able to work with so closely , for they hold their meeting in person 's study . 
`` some guy bother me '' , person has say . 
`` i could n't write with them in the same room with me , but i could with person . 
he be probably our most original composer ; he often use very odd rhythm , which make it difficult , and challenging , for the lyric writer '' . 
while person and person collaborate on hot_nocturne , person work also with person on another film , navy_blues . 
person , too , work_on other project at_the_same_time with old friend person . 
besides do a single song , `` when_the_sun_comes_out '' , they work_on the ambitious americanegro_suite , for voice and piano , as_well_as song for film . 
the americanegro_suite be in_a_sense an extension of the cotton_club song in_that it be a collection of negro song , not for a nightclub , but for the concert stage . 
the work had its beginning in 1938 with an eight bar musical strain to which person set the words `` there 'll be no more work / there 'll be no more worry '' , match the spiritual feeling of the jot . 
this grow_into the song `` big_time_comin '' ' . 
by september 1940 the suite had develop into a collection of six song , `` four spiritual , a dream , and a lullaby '' . 
the negro composer person study the americanegro_suite and say of it , `` of all the many song write by white composer and employ what claim to be a negroid idiom in both words and music , these six song by person and person easily stand_out far out above the rest . 
thoroughly modern in treatment , they be at_the_same_time , full of simple sincerity which invariably characterize genuine negro folk_music and are by_no_means to be confuse with the average ' broadway spiritual ' which depend_upon for their racial flavor upon sundry allusion to the ' amen_corner ' , ' judgement_day ' , ' person 's horn ' , and a frustrated devil - with a_few random ' hallelujah ' throw_in for_good_measure . 
two facet of this aspect of the literary process have special significance for our time . 
one , a reservation on the point i have just make , be the phenomenon of pseudo thinking , pseudo feeling , and pseudo willing , which person discuss in the_escape_from_freedom . 
in_essence this involve ground one 's thought and emotion in the values and experience of others , rather_than in one 's own values and experience . 
there be a risk that instead of teach a person how to be himself , read fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else . 
clearly what the person bring to the reading be important . 
moreover , if the critic instruct his audience in what to see in a work , he is contribute to this pseudo think ; if he instruct them in how to evaluate a work , he is help them to achieve their own identity . 
the second timely part of_this sketch of literature and the search for identity have to do with the difference between good and enduring literary_work and the ephemeral mass_culture product of today . 
in the range and variety of character who , in their literary life , get_along all_right with life_style one never imagine possible , there be an implicit lesson in differentiation . 
the reader , observe this process , might ask `` why not be different '' ? and find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species . 
the observer of television or other product for a mass audience have only a permit to be , like the model he see , even more like everybody else . 
and this , i think , hold for values as_well as life_style . 
one would need_to test this proposition carefully ; after_all , the large ( and probably unreliable ) reader 's digest literature on the `` most unforgettable character i ever meet '' deal with village grocer , country_doctor , favorite if illiterate aunt , and_so_forth . 
scientist often turn_out to be idiosyncratic , too . 
but still , the proposition be worth examination . 
it be possible that the study of literature affect the conscience , the morality , the sensitivity to some code of `` right '' and `` wrong '' . 
i do not know that this be true ; both person and person deal with the development and nature of conscience , as do such theologian as person and person . 
it form the core of many , perhaps most , problem of psychotherapy . 
i be not aware of great attention by any of these author or by the psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary_study in the development of conscience - most_of their attention be to a preliterate period of life , or , for the theologian of_course , to the influence of religion . 
still , it would be surprising if what one read did not contribute to one 's idea of right and wrong ; certainly the awakened alarm over the comic_book and the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate some peripheral aspect of_this influence . 
probably the most important thing to focus_on be not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the content of conscience , the code which is impart to the developed or immature conscience available . 
this be in large part a code_of_behavior and a glossary of values : what be it that people do and should do and_how one should regard it . 
in a small way this is illustrate by the nineteenth century novelist who argue for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrate this with the way a girl learn to meet her lover , how to behave , how to think about this new experience , how to exercise restraint . 
literature may be say to give people a sense_of_purpose , dedication , mission , significance . 
this , no_doubt , be part of what person imply when he say of the arts , `` they give form and meaning to life which might otherwise seem shapeless and without sense '' . 
man seem almost universally to want a sense of function , that_is , a feeling that their existence make a difference to someone , living or unborn , close and immediate or generalized . 
feel useless seem generally to be an unpleasant sensation . 
a need so deeply planted , ask for direction , so_to_speak , be likely to be gratify by the vivid example and heroic proportion of literature . 
the term `` renewal '' and `` refreshed '' , which often come_up in aesthetic discussion , seem partly to derive their import from the `` renewal '' of purpose and a `` refreshed '' sense of significance a person may receive from poetry , drama , and fiction . 
the notion of `` inspiration '' be somehow cognate to this feeling . 
how literature do this , or for whom , be certainly not clear , but the content , form , and language of the `` message '' , as_well_as the source , would all play differentiated part in give and mold a sense_of_purpose . 
one of the most salient feature of literary value has been deem to be its influence upon and organization of emotion . 
let us differentiate a_few of these idea . 
the aristotelian notion of catharsis , the purging of emotion , be a persistent and viable one . 
the idea here be one of discharge but this must stand in opposition to a second view , plato 's notion of the arousal of emotion . 
a third idea be that artistic literature serve to reduce emotional conflict , give a sense of serenity and calm to individual . 
this is given some expression in person 's notion of harmony and the resolution of indecision . 
a fourth view be the transformation of emotion , as in person 's fine phrase on the arts : 
they `` transform and beautify our inner nature '' . 
it be possible that the idea of enrichment of emotion be a fifth idea . 
person , in his discussion of the `` functions_and_future_of_poetry '' , suggest this : 
`` one of the thing which make our life drab and empty and which leave us , at the end of the day , fatigued and deflated spiritually be the pressure of the taxing , practical , utilitarian concern of commonsense object . 
if art is to release us from these postulate thing [ thing we must think symbolically about ] and bring us back to the ineffable beauty and richness of the aesthetic component of reality in its immediacy , it must sever its connection with these commonsense entity '' . 
i take the central meaning here to be the contrast between the drab empty quality_of_life without literature and a life enrich by it . 
person ' view of the aesthetic experience might constitute a sixth variety : for him it constitute , in part , the organization of impulse . 
a sketch of the emotional value of the study of literature would have_to take_account of all_of these . 
but there be one in_particular which , it seem to me , deserve special attention . 
in the wide range of experience common to our earthbound race none be more difficult to manage , more troublesome , and more enduring in its effect than the control of love and hate . 
the study of literature contribute to this control in a curious way . 
person and person , it seem to me , have a penetrating insight into the way in_which this control is effect : `` for if we say poetry be to talk of beauty and love ( and yet not aim at excite erotic emotion or even an emotion of platonic esteem ) and if it be to talk of anger and murder ( and yet not aim at arouse anger and indignation ) - then it may be that the poetic way of deal with these emotion will not be any kind of intensification , compounding , or magnification , or any direct assault upon the affection at_all . 
something indirect , mixed , reconciling , tensional might well be the stratagem , the devious technique by which a poet indulge in all kind of talk about love and anger and even in something like '' expression `` of these emotion , without aim at their incitement or even utter anything that essentially involve their incitement '' . 
the rehearsal through literature of emotional life under controlled condition may be a most valuable human experience . 
here i do not mean catharsis , the discharge of emotion . 
i mean something more like person 's concept of the utility of `` play '' to a small child : he play `` house '' or `` doctor '' or `` fireman '' as a way of master slightly frightening experience , reliving them imaginatively until they be under control . 
there be a second feature of the influence of literature , good literature , on emotional life which may have some special value for our time . 
in person 's portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of london , a salient finding be the inability to postpone gratification , a need to satisfy impulse immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savor the experience . 
perhaps it be only an analogy , but one of the most obvious difference between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring quality be the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation . 
anyone who has watch child develop a taste for literature will understand what i mean . 
it be at_least possible that the capacity to postpone gratification is develop as_well_as express in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature . 
in any inquiry into the way in which great literature affect the emotion , particularly with_respect_to the sense of harmony , or relief of tension , or sense of `` a transformed inner nature '' which may occur , a most careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which produce the effect would be require . 
in the calm which follow the reading of a poem , for_example , be the effect produce by the enforced quiet , by the musical quality of words and rhythm , by the sentiment or sense of the poem , by the association with earlier reading , if it be familiar , by the boost to the self-esteem for the semiliterate , by the diversion of attention , by the sense of security in a legitimize withdrawal , by a kind license for some variety of fantasy_life regard_as forbidden , or by half conscious idea about the magical_power of words ? 
these be , if the research is do with subtlety and skill , researchable topic , but the research be missing . 
one of the most frequent view of the value of literature be the education of sensibility that it is think to provide . 
sensibility be a vague word , cover an area of meaning rather than any precise talent , quality , or skill . 
among_other_things it mean perception , discrimination , sensitivity to subtle difference . 
both the extent to which this be true and the limit of the field of perceptual skill involved should be acknowledge . 
its truth is illustrate by the skill , sensitivity , and general expertise of the english_professor with whom one attend the theatre . 
the limit are suggest by an imaginary experiment : contrast the perceptual skill of english_professor with that of their colleague in discriminate among motorcar , political candidate , or female beauty . 
along these line , the particular point that sensitivity in literature lead to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than i have see . 
in a symposium and general exploration of the field of person perception and interpersonal behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject , with one possible exception ; person show the transcultural stability of metaphor base on sensation ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc . ) deal with personal quality of human_being and event . 
but to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal difference be too great an inferential leap . 
i would say , too , that the study of literature tend to give a person what i shall call depth . 
i use this term to mean three thing : a search for the human significance of an event or state_of_affairs , a tendency to look_at whole rather_than part , and a tendency to respond to these event and whole with feeling . 
it be the obverse of triviality , shallowness , emotional anaesthesia . 
i think these attribute cluster , but i have no evidence . 
in_fact , i can only say this seem to me to follow from a wide , continuous , and properly guided exposure to literary art . 
the late person , a philosopher whose work has prove helpful to many student of literature , once write `` we be all , though many_of us be snobbish enough to wish to deny it , in far close sympathy with the art of the music_hall and picture_palace than with person and person , or even shakespeare and person . 
by an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our mind back into the art of a remote past or an alien present , and enjoy the carving of caveman and japanese colour print ; but the possibility of this effort be bound_up with that development of historical thought which be the greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two century , and it be utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not take_place . 
the natural and primary aesthetic attitude be to enjoy contemporary art , to despise and dislike the art of the recent past , and wholly to ignore everything else '' . 
one might argue that the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship be to correct this spontaneous provincialism that be likely to obscure the horizon of the general public , of the newspaper_critic , and of the creative artist himself . 
there result a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the contemporary . 
such study may take many form . 
the study of idea in literature be one of these . 
of_course , it goes_without_saying that no student of idea can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene . 
he will frequently return to it . 
the continuity , contrast , and similarity discernible when past and present are survey together be inexhaustible and the one is often understand through the other . 
when we assert the value of such study , we find ourselves commit to an important assumption . 
most student of literature , whether they call themselves scholar or critic , be ready to argue that it be possible to understand literary_work as_well_as to enjoy them . 
many will add that we may find our enjoyment heighten by our understanding . 
this understanding , of_course , may in_its_turn take many form and some of these - especially those most interesting to the student of comparative_literature - be essentially historical . 
but the historian of literature need not confine his attention to biography or to stylistic question of form , `` texture '' , or technique . 
he may also consider idea . 
it be true that this distinction between style and idea often approach the arbitrary since in_the_end we must admit that style and content frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes appear as expression of the same insight . 
but , in_general , we may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention toward one or the other . 
at this point a working definition of idea be in_order , although our first definition will have to be qualify somewhat as we proceed . 
the term idea refer to our more reflective or thoughtful consciousness as_opposed_to the immediacy of sensuous or emotional experience . 
it is through such reflection that literature approach philosophy . 
an idea , let us say , may be roughly define as a theme or topic with which our reflection may be concerned . 
in this essay , we be , along with most historian , interested in the more general or more inclusive idea , that be so_to_speak `` writ_large '' in history of literature where they recur continually . 
outstanding among these be the idea of human nature itself , include the many definition that have been advance over the century ; also secondary notion such_as the perfectibility of man , the depravity of man , and the dignity of man . 
one might , indeed , argue that the history of idea , in_so_far as it include the literature , must center_on characterization of human nature and that the great period of literary achievement may be distinguish from one another by reference to the image of human nature that they succeed in fashion . 
we need not , to_be_sure , expect to find such idea in every piece of literature . 
an idea , of the sort that we have_in_mind , although of_necessity readily available to imagination , be more general in connotation than most poetic or literary image , especially those appear in lyric_poem that seek to capture a moment of personal experience . 
thus person 's `` my love be like a red , red rose '' and person ' `` the thunder-purple sea beach , plumed purple of thunder '' although clearly intelligible in content , hardly present idea of the sort with which we are here concern . 
on_the_other_hand , person 's `` the unplumbed , salt , estranging sea '' , take in its context , certainly does so . 
understand a work_of_art involve recognition of the idea that it reflect or embody . 
thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify a poem or an essay as be in idea or in ideal content or subject_matter typical or atypical of its period . 
again , he may discover embodied within its texture a theme or idea that has been present elsewhere and at other time in various way . 
our understanding will very probably require both these commentary . 
very likely it will also include a recognition that the work we are read reflect or `` belong_to '' some way of thought label as a `` school '' or an `` - ism '' , i.e. a complex or `` syndrome '' of idea occur together with sufficient prominence to warrant identification . 
thus idea like `` grace '' , `` salvation '' , and `` providence '' cluster together in traditional christianity . 
usually the work study offer us a special or even an individualized rendering or treatment of the idea in_question , so that the student find it necessary to distinguish carefully between the several expression of an `` - ism '' or mode of thought . 
accordingly we may speak_of the platonism peculiar to person 's poem or the type of stoicism present in person 's `` invictus '' , and we may find that describe such platonism or such stoicism and contrast each with other expression of the same attitude or mode of thought be a difficult and challenging enterprise . 
after_all , person be no `` orthodox '' or hellenic platonist , and even his `` romantic '' platonism can be distinguish from that of his contemporaries . 
again , person 's attitude of defiance which color his ideal of self mastery be far from characteristic of a stoic thinker like person , whose gentle acquiescence be almost christian , comparable_to the patience express in person 's sonnet on his own blindness . 
in recent year , we have come increasingly to recognize that idea have a history and that not the least important chapter of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspect of literature and the art , although these aspect should be study in_conjunction_with the history of philosophy , of religion , and of the science . 
when these field are survey together , important pattern of relationship emerge indicate a vast community of reciprocal influence , a continuity of thought and expression include many tradition , primarily literary , religious , and philosophical , but frequently include contact with the fine_arts and even , to some extent , with science . 
here we may observe that at_least one modern philosophy of history is build on the assumption that idea be the primary objective of the historian 's research . 
let us quote once_more from person : `` history is properly concern with the action of human_being . 
regard from the outside , an action be an event or series of event occur in the physical world ; regard from the inside , it be the carrying_into_action of a certain thought . 
the historian 's business be to penetrate to the inside of the action with which he is deal and reconstruct or rather rethink the thought which constitute them . 
it be a characteristic of thought that , in rethink them we come , ipso_facto , to understand why they were think '' . 
such an understanding , although it must seek to be sympathetic , be not a matter of intuition . 
`` history have this in_common with every other science : that the historian be not allow to claim any single piece of knowledge , except where he can justify his claim by exhibit to himself in_the_first_place , and secondly to any one else who be both able and willing to follow his demonstration , the grounds upon which it is base . 
this be what was mean , above , by describe history as inferential . 
the knowledge in_virtue_of_which a man be an historian be a knowledge of what the evidence at his disposal prove about certain event '' . 
it is obvious that the historian who seek to recapture the idea that have motivate human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concern , by_no_means a mere supplement or adjunct of significant historical research . 
the student of idea and their place in history will always be concerned with the pattern of transition , which be at_the_same_time pattern of transformation , whereby idea pass from one area of activity to another . 
let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought - turn our attention from the reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movement that follow and dwell_on finally on more recent decade . 
we may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious practice and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the art . 
finally we may note that the idea appear in educational theory where its influence be at_present widespread . 
no one will deny that such broad development and transition be of great intrinsic interest and the study of idea in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference to them . 
still , we must remember that we cannot construct and justify generalization of this sort unless we be ready to consider many special instance of influence move between such_as area as theology , philosophy , political thought , and literature . 
the actual moment of contact be vitally important . 
these moment be historical event in the life of individual author with which the student of comparative_literature must be frequently concern . 
perhaps the most powerful and most frequently recur literary influence on the western world has be that of the old_testament and new_testament . 
certainly one of the most important comment that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural life of any period of western civilization during the past sixteen or seventeen century have to do with the way in which its leaders have read and interpret the bible . 
this reading and the comment that it evoke constitute the influence . 
a contrast of the scripture reading of , let us say , person , person , and person , all three of whom find in such study a real source of enlightenment , can tell us a great_deal about these three man and the age that each represent and help bring to conscious expression . 
in much the same way , we recognize the importance of shakespeare 's familiarity with person and person , of person 's study of plato 's dialogue , and of coleridge 's enthusiastic plundering of the writing of many philosopher and theologian from plato to person and person , through which so many abstract idea were bring to the attention of english man_of_letters . 
we may also recognize case in which the poet have influence the philosopher and even indirectly the scientist . 
english philosopher person 's debt to wordsworth and person be a recent interesting example , as also person 's understanding of the english romantic , chiefly person and wordsworth . 
hegel 's profound admiration for the insight of the greek tragedian indicate a broad channel of classical influence upon nineteenth century philosophy . 
again the student of evolutionary biology will find a fascinating , if to our mind grotesque , anticipation of the theory of chance variation and the natural elimination of the unfit in person , who in_turn seem to have borrow the concept from the philosopher person . 
here an important caveat be in_order . 
we must avoid the notion , suggest to some people by example such_as those just mention , that idea be `` unit '' in_some_way comparable_to coin or counter that can be pass intact from one group of people to another or even , for_that_matter , from one individual to another .

the relative effectiveness of voluntary versus mandatory report of accident statistic ; 
the relative contribution to safety of inspection program embody - 
right_of_entry only and right_of_entry plus enforcement authority ;

the secretary_of_the_interior or any duly authorized representative shall be entitle to admission to , and to require report from the operator of , any metal or nonmetallic mine which be in a state ( exclude any coal or lignite mine ) , the product of_which regularly enter commerce or the operation of_which substantially affect commerce , for the purpose of gather datum and information necessary for the study authorize in the first section of_this act . 
as use in_this section - 
the term `` state '' include the commonwealth of puerto_rico and any possession of the united_states ; and the term `` commerce '' mean commerce between any state and any place outside thereof , or between point within the same state but through any place outside thereof . 
the secretary_of_the_interior shall submit a report of his finding , together with recommendation for an effective safety program for metal and nonmetallic mine ( exclude coal and lignite mine ) base upon such finding , to the congress not more_than two year after the date of enactment of_this act . 
approve september 26 , 1961 . 
be it enact by the senate and house_of_representatives of the united_states_of_america in congress assemble , that the secretary_of_the_interior is hereby authorize and direct to establish and maintain a program of stabilization payment to small domestic producer of lead and zinc ore and concentrate in_order to stabilize the mining of lead and zinc by small domestic producer on public , indian , and other land as provide in_this act . 
subject_to the limitation of_this act , the secretary_of_the_interior shall make stabilization payment to small domestic producer upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to him of their status as such producer and of the sale by them of newly mine ore , or concentrate produce therefrom , as provide in_this act . 
payment shall be make only with_respect_to the metal content as determine by assay . 
such payment shall be make to small domestic producer of lead as_long_as the market_price for common lead at new_york , new_york , as determine by the secretary_of_the_interior , be below 14 - 1 2 cent per pound , and such payment shall be 75 per centum of the difference between 14 - 1 2 cent per pound and the average market_price for the month in_which the sale occur as determine by the secretary_of_the_interior . 
such payment shall be make to small domestic producer of zinc as_long_as the market_price for prime western zinc at location , illinois , as determine by the secretary_of_the_interior , be below 14 - 1 2 cent per pound , and such payment shall be 55 per centum of the difference between 14 - 1 2 cent per pound and the average market_price for the month in_which the sale occur as determine by the secretary_of_the_interior . 
the maximum amount of payment which may be make pursuant to this act on_account_of sale of newly mine ore or concentrate produce therefrom make during the calendar_year 1962 shall not exceed $ 4500000 ; the maximum amount of such payment which may be made on_account_of such sale make during the calendar_year 1963 shall not exceed $ 4500000 ; the maximum amount of such payment which may be make on_account_of such sale make during the calendar_year 1964 shall not exceed $ 4000000 ; and the maximum amount of such payment which may be make on_account_of such sale make during the calendar_year 1965 shall not exceed $ 3500000 . 
another recent achievement be the successful development of a method for the complete combustion in a bomb_calorimeter of a metal in fluorine when the product be relatively nonvolatile . 
this work give a heat_of_formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiate a value which had been determine by a less direct method , and raise this property to 15 percent above that accept a_few year ago . 
similar measurement are being initiate to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat_of_formation of another important combustion product , beryllium fluoride . 
the development and testing of new apparatus to measure other property is near completion . 
in one of these , an explode wire device to study system thermodynamically up_to 6000 * * f and 100 atmosphere pressure , a major goal was achieve . 
the accuracy of measure the total electrical energy enter an explode wire during a_few microsecond was verify when two independent type of comparison with the heat_energy produce have an uncertainty of less_than 2 percent . 
this agreement is consider very good for such short time interval . 
the method of calibration employ a fixed resistance element as a calorimeter . 
the element is insert in the discharge circuit in_place_of the explode wire , and the calorimetric heating of the element is measure with high accuracy . 
this is use as a reference for compare the ohmic heating and the electrical energy obtain from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element . 
a high-speed shutter has been develop in_order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion . 
the shutter consist_of two part : a fast opening part and a fast closing part . 
use person 's method , the fast closing action is obtain from the blackening of a window by explode a series of parallel lead wire . 
the fast open of the shutter consist_of a piece of aluminum_foil ( approximately * * f ) place directly in_front of the camera_lens so that no light may pass into the camera . 
the opening action is obtain when a capacitor , charge to high voltage , is suddenly discharge through the foil . 
during the discharge the magnetic_force set_up by the passage of current cause the edge of the foil to roll inward toward its center_line , thus allow light to pass into the camera . 
experiment have show that the shutter be 75 percent open in about 60 - 80 microsecond . 
the shutter aperture may be make larger or smaller by change the foil area and adjust the electrical energy input to the foil . 
besides the well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm wavelength , the spectrum of extraterrestrial radio_source may contain sharp line characteristic of other atom , ion , and small molecule . 
the detection and study of such line spectrum would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas cloud and , perhaps , planetary atmosphere . 
among the most likely producer of detectable radio line spectrum be the light diatomic hydride oh and ch ; somewhat less likely source be the heavy hydride sh , sih , and sch . 
very small concentration of these hydride should be detectable ; in interstellar gas , concentration as low as * * f molecule / * * f may be sufficient , as compare to the * * f hydrogen_atom * * f require for detection of the 21 - cm line . 
high sensitivity in radio_telescope is achieve by reduce the bandwidth of the receiver ; therefore , only with precise foreknowledge of the line frequency be an astronomical search for the radio_spectrum of these molecule feasible . 
to secure precise measurement of these frequency , a research program in free_radical microwave spectroscopy has been start . 
since conventional method be insensitive at the low_frequency of these molecular transition , the paramagnetic resonance method is being use instead . 
this involve the application of a strong magnetic_field to the radical vapor , which shift the low_frequency spectrum to a conveniently high microwave range , where they may be measure with optimum sensitivity . 
the first diatomic hydride investigate by the paramagnetic resonance method be the oh radical . 
result of_this experiment include the frequency of the two strong spectral line by which oh may be identify in interstellar gas ; the frequency be 1665.32 and 1667.36 * * f , with an uncertainty of 0.10 * * f . 
success in observe these spectral line has so_far , apparently , been confine to the laboratory ; extraterrestrial observation have yet to be report . 
preparation are being make for similar experiment on ch and sh radical . 
the group is pursue an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration service in the range 15 to 20 * * f . 
the effort and accomplishment fall_into three main category : absolute thermometry base upon the velocity of sound in helium gas , secondary thermometry involve principally study of the behavior of germanium resistor , and helium 4 vapor_pressure measurement ( see p. 144 ) . 
an acoustical interferometer has been construct and use , with helium gas as the thermometric fluid , to measure temperature near 4.2 and 2.1 * * f . 
such an interferometer provide a means of absolute_temperature measurement , and may be use as_an_alternative to the gas_thermometer . 
when value of temperature derive with this instrument were compare with the accepted value associate with liquid helium 4 vapor_pressure , difference of about 10 and 7 millidegree respectively were find . 
this result be preliminary , and work is continue . 
carbon resistor and impurity doped germanium resistor have been investigate for use as precision secondary thermometer in the liquid helium temperature region . 
several germanium resistor have been thermally cycle from 300 to 4.2 * * f and their resistance have been find to be reproducible within 1 3 millidegree when temperature were derive from a vapor_pressure thermometer whose tubing is jacket through most_of the liquid helium . 
preliminary calibration of the resistor have been make from 4.21 to 2.16 * * f at every 0.1 * * f . 
the estimated standard_deviation of the datum for two of the resistor be 1 millidegree ; and for the third resistor , 3.3 millidegree . 
the reproducibility of helium vapor_pressure thermometer have been investigate in conjunction with a `` constant temperature '' liquid helium bath from 4.2 to 1.8 * * f . 
surface temperature_gradient have been find to exist in liquid helium bath contain in 15 - and 25 - liter metallic storage dewar . 
the gradient be about one-half of a millidegree at 4.2 * * f but increase to several millidegree for bath temperature slightly greater than the one l point . 
a hydrostatic_head correction has been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor_pressure or temperature for the bulk liquid helium . 
however , the surface temperature_gradient can produce erroneous vapor_pressure measurement for the bulk liquid helium unless precaution are take to isolate the tube ( which pass_through the surface to the vapor_pressure bulb ) from the liquid helium surface . 
it has also been observe , in helium 2 , , that large discrepancy can exist between surface vapor_pressure and those pressure measure by a vapor_pressure thermometer . 
this has been attribute to helium film flow in the vapor_pressure thermometer . 
in this case also the design of the thermometer can be modify to reduce the helium film flow . 
precise pressure volume temperature measurement on corrosive gas be dependent_on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer . 
a prototype which fulfill the requirement was develop and thoroughly test . 
the transducer be a null type instrument and employ a stretched diaphragm , 0.001 in thick and 1 in in diameter . 
a small pressure unbalance displace the diaphragm and change the capacitance between the diaphragm and an electrically insulate plate space 0.001 in apart ( for * * f ) . 
spherical concave backing surface support the diaphragm when excessive pressure are apply and prevent the stress within the diaphragm from exceed the elastic limit . 
over a temperature range from 25 to 200 * * f and at pressure up_to 250 atm , an overload of 300 psi , apply for a period of one day , result in an uncertainty in the pressure of , at_most , one millimeter_of_mercury . 
a 6 - year study of the transport property of air at elevated temperature has been complete . 
this project was carry_out under sponsorship of the group , group , and have as its goal the investigation of the transport by diffusion of the heat_energy of chemical binding . 
a significant effect discover during the study be the existence of person number reach value of more_than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region . 
another effect discover be the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tend to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature difference straddle the nitrogen dissociation region be present . 
the result of the study , base on collision integral compute from the latest critically evaluate data on intermolecular force in air , will be report in the form of a table of viscosity , thermal conductivity , thermal diffusion , and diffusion coefficient at temperature of 1000 to 10000 * * f and of logarithm of pressure in atmosphere from * * f to * * f times normal density . 
in march , 1961 , representative of the national laboratory of australia , canada , the_netherlands , united_kingdom , location , united_states , and location , meet at the group to devise means for reach international agreement on a temperature scale between 10 and 90 * * f . 
as a first_step toward this goal , arrangement were work_out for compare the scale now in_use through circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance_thermometer for calibration by each national laboratory . 
such a group of thermometer was obtain and calibrate at the group . 
these thermometer have now been send to the united_kingdom for calibration at the location . 
during the last week of march 1961 , columbus , ohio be the site of the group , group . 
the symposium , which was jointly sponsor by the american_institute_of_physics , the instrument_society_of_america , and the national_bureau_of_standards , attract nearly one_thousand registrant , include many from abroad . 
the group contribute to the planning and success of the symposium through the effort of person , person , and person , person . 
person , person , open the 5 - day session with introductory remark , following which a total of twenty-six paper were give throughout the week by group scientist , from both the washington and group . 
in_addition to the basic program in wavelength standard , spectroscopy , solid-state physics , interaction of the free electron and atomic constant which be necessary to provide the foundation for technological progress , the group has strengthen its activity in laboratory astrophysics . 
the program in infrared spectroscopy are undergo reorientation toward wavelength standard in the far infrared , the application of infrared technique to solid-state study , and increased emphasis on high resolution instrumentation . 
two data center have been establish for the collection , indexing , critical evaluation , and dissemination of bibliography and critical value in the field of transition probability and collision cross_section . 
under the sponsorship of the group and the group , a data center was establish to gather and index all published information on atomic transition probability . 
an exhaustive survey was make of the literature , and a primary reference file of approximately 600 reference was catalogue . 
selected bibliography and table of available data be now in preparation . 
a wall stabilized high current arc source was construct and use to study transition probability of atomic hydrogen and oxygen . 
this apparatus will also be use to measure transition probability of a large_number of other element . 
a study of the hydrogen line profile indicate that a measurement of these profile can be use to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that be reliable to about * * f percent . 
a set of table contain spectral intensity for 39000 line of 70 element , as observe in a copper matrix in a dc arc , was complete and publish . 
study of the intensity data indicate that they may be convert to approximate transition probability . 
these data be not of the precision obtainable by the method previously mention , but the vast number of approximate value available will be useful in many area . 
research continue on the very complex spectrum of the rare_earth element . 
new computer and automation technique were apply to these spectrum with considerable success .

person , for several year now the commuter railroad serve our large metropolitan area have find it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population want and is entitled to have . 
the cause of the decline of the commuter railroad be many and complex - high tax , losses of revenue to government subsidized highway and air carrier , to name but two . 
and the solution to the problem of the commuter line have been equally vary , range all_the_way from government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service . 
there have been a number of sound plan propose . 
but none of these has been implement . 
instead we have stand_by idly by , watch our commuter railroad service decline , and have fail to offer a helping_hand . 
though the number of people flow in and out of our metropolitan area each_day has increase tremendously since world_war_ii , , total annual rail commutation drop 124 million from 1947 to 1957 . 
nowhere has this decline be more painfully evident than in the new_york_city area . 
here the group , one of the nation 's most important carrier , has alone lose 47.6 percent of its passenger since 1949 . 
at this time of crisis in our nation 's commuter railroad , a new threat to the continued operation of the group has appear in the form of the group 's proposal for control of the group . 
the group has point_out that this control , if approve by the group , would give the combined group - group a total of 185 point serve in_common with the group . 
not_only be this kind of duplication wasteful , but it give the combined system the ability to take_away freight traffic away from the group and other railroad serve the area . 
the group note : `` the freight traffic most susceptible to raid by the group group group provide the backbone of group 's revenue . 
these revenue make_possible it possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire group system as_well_as the new_york area commuter and terminal freight services . 
if these services be to be maintained , the group must have the revenue to make them possible '' . 
the group today handle 60 percent of all southbound commuter_traffic come into new_york_city . 
this be a $ 14 million operation involve 3500 employee who work_on commuter_traffic exclusively . 
a blow to this phase of the group 's operation would have serious economic consequence not_only to the railroad itself , but to the 40000 people per day who are provide with efficient , reasonably priced transportation in_and_out of the city . 
`` there is a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful c. + o. - b. + o. merger scheme '' - 
the group has point_out . 
`` the logic of create a strong , balanced , competitive two system railroad service in the east be so obvious that group was publicly commit to the approach outline here . 
detailed study of the plan be well underway . 
though far from completion , these study indicate beyond a doubt that saving would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroad concerned , their investor , their customer , their user , and to the public at_large . 
then , abandon the study in the face of their promising outlook for all concerned , b. + o. enter on-again-off-again negotiation with c. + o. which result in the present situation . 
in the light of the fact at_hand , however , group intend to pursue the objective of help to create a healthy two system eastern railroad structure in the public interest `` . 
the group will commence its deliberation on the proposed group group o. merger on june 18 . 
obviously , the group will not force the group to further curtail its commuter operation by give undue competitive advantage to the line that wish to merge . 
however , there is a more profound consideration to this proposed merger than profit and loss . 
that_is , will it serve the long-range public interest ? 
for the past 40 year congress has advocate a carefully planned , balanced and competitive railway_system . 
we must ask ourselves which of the two alternative will help the commuter - the two-way b. group o. merger , or the three-way group group merger . 
which will serve not_only the best interest of the stockholder , but the interest of all the traveling public ? 
person , i rise today to pay tribute to a great newspaper , the group , on the occasion of a major change in its top_executive command . 
person has be a distinguished publisher of this distinguished newspaper and it be fitting that we take_notice due notice of his major contribution to american journalism on the occasion of his retirement . 
i be pleased to note that person will continue to serve as chairman_of_the_board of the group . 
person 's successor as publisher be person , who be president of the group , and who has be with the group since 1942 . 
person ' outstanding career as a journalist guarantee that the high standard which have make the group one of the world 's great newspaper will be maintain . 
i be also pleased to note that person , a member of the group staff since 1946 , has been appoint as editorial page editor . 
person succeed person , editor since 1938 , who now become editor emeritus . 
i should_like at this time , person , to pay warm tribute to person and person on the occasion of their retirement from distinguished career in american journalism . 
my hearty congratulation go to their successor , person and person , who can be count_upon to sustain the illustrious tradition of the group . 
the people of the 17th district of new_york , and i as their representative in congress , take_pride great pride in the group as one of the great and authoritative newspaper of the world . 
person , in my latest newsletter to my constituent i urge the imposition of a naval_blockade of cuba as the only effective method of prevent continued soviet armament from come into the western_hemisphere in violation of the monroe_doctrine . 
yesterday , i have the privilege of read a thoughtful article in the u._s._news_+_world_report of may eighth which discuss this type of action in more detail , include both its advantage and its disadvantage . 
under leave to extend my remark , i include the relevant portion of my newsletter , together with the text of the article from the u._s._news_+_world_report : 
`` 
cuban group : whatever may have been the setback result from the unsuccessful attempt of the cuban rebel to establish a beachhead on the person held mainland last week , there was at_least one positive benefit , and that be the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of cuba into a russian dominated military base . 
in_fact , one of the major reason for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appear to have be a lack of full information on the extent to which cuba has been get this russian military equipment . 
somehow , the picture and story of soviet t-34 tank on cuban beach and russian mig jet fighter strafe rebel troops has bring_home to all_of us the stark , blunt truth of what it mean to have a russian military base 90 mile away from home . 
russian tank and plane in cuba jeopardize the security of the united_states , violate the monroe_doctrine , and threaten the security of every other latin-american republic . 
once the full extent of_this russian military penetration of cuba be clear , person announce we would take whatever action be appropriate to prevent this , even if we have to go it alone . 
but the latin_american republic who have been rather incline to drag_one's_feet their feet on take action against person also react swiftly last week by finally throw cuba off the group . 
for years the united_states had been try to get these country to exclude person 's representative from secret military talks . 
but it take the picture of the migs and the t-34 tank to do the job . 
there is a new atmosphere of urgency in washington this week . 
you can see it , for_example , in the extensive effort person has make to enlist solid bipartisan support for his action toward both cuba and laos ; effort , as i see it , which are being direct , by_the_way , toward support for future action , not for those already past . 
what the next move will be only time , of_course , will tell . 
personally , i think we ought to set_up an immediate naval_blockade of cuba . 
we simply can n't tolerate further russian weapon , include the possibility of long-range nuclear missile , being locate in cuba . 
obviously , we can n't stop them from come_in , however , just by talk . 
a naval_blockade would be thoroughly in line with the monroe_doctrine , would be a relatively simple operation to carry_out , and would bring an abrupt end to soviet penetration of our hemisphere `` . 
look_at person now - cocky than ever with arms and agent to threaten the_americas . 
how can the united_states act ? 
blockade be one answer offer by expert . 
in it they see a way to isolate cuba , stop infiltration , maybe finish person , too . 
this be the question now face person : 
how to put a stop to the soviet buildup in cuba and to communist infiltration of this hemisphere ? 
on april twenty-fifth , the white_house report that a total embargo of remaining u.s. trade with cuba was being consider . 
its aim : to undermine further cuba 's economy . 
weaken person . 
another strategy - bold and tough - was also attract notice in washington : a naval and air blockade to cut_off cuba off from the world , destroy person . 
blockade , in the view of military and civilian expert , could restore tooth to the monroe_doctrine . 
it could halt a flood of communist arms and strategic supplies now reach person . 
it could stop cuban re export of gun and propaganda material to south_america . 
it would be the most severe reprisal , short_of declared war , that the united_states could invoke against person . 
it is the strategy of blockade , therefore , that be suddenly at the center of attention of administration official , member of congress , officer in the pentagon . 
as a possible course of action , it also be the center of debate and is raise many question . 
among these question : 
military expert say a tight naval_blockade off cuban port and at the approach to cuban water would require two naval task_force , each build around an aircraft_carrier with a complement of about 100 plane and several destroyer . 
the us_navy , on april twenty-fifth , announce it is bring_back the carrier shangri-la from the mediterranean , increase to four the number of attack_aircraft_carrier in the vicinity of cuba . 
more than 36 other big navy ship be no less_than a day 's sailing time away . 
to round_out the blockading force , submarine would be need - to locate , identify and track approaching vessel . 
land based radar would help with this task . 
so would radar picket_ship . 
a squadron of us_navy jet and another of long-range patrol plane would add support to the carrier task_force . 
three requirement go_with a blockade : it must be proclaim ; the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it ; and it must be enforce without discrimination . 
once these condition of international_law are meet , country that try to run to blockade do so at their own risk . 
blockade runner can be stop - by gunfire , if necessary - search and hold , at_least temporarily . 
they could be send to u.s. port for ruling whether cargo should be confiscate . 
plenty , say the expert . 
in a broad sense , it would reaffirm the monroe_doctrine by oppose communist interference in the western_hemisphere . 
it could , by avoid direct intervention , provide a short-of war strategy to meet short-of war infiltration . 
primary target would be shipment of tank , gun , aviation gasoline and ammunition come from russia and czechoslovakia . 
shipment of arms from western country could similarly be seize as contraband . 
in a total blockade , action could also be take against ship bring_in chemical , oil , textile , and even foodstuff . 
at_times , three ship a day from the soviet bloc are unload in cuban port . 
from its inception in 1920 with the passage of public_law 236 , group , the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation_program has been to assist the state , by means of grant-in-aid , to return disabled man and woman to productive , gainful employment . 
the authority for the program was renew several time until the vocational rehabilitation_program was make permanent as title 5 , of the social_security_act in 1935 . 
up to this time and for the next eight year , the services provide disabled person consist_of mainly of training , counseling , and placement on a job . 
recognize the limitation of such a program , the group in 1943 pass public_law 113 , which broaden the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disability , and which revise the financing structure . 
despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled person in the first eleven year after 1943 , the existing program was still see to be inadequate to cope_with the nation 's backlog of an estimated two million disabled . 
to assist the state , therefore , in rehabilitate handicapped individual , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capability '' , the group enact the vocational_rehabilitation_amendments_of_1954 ( public_law 565 ) . 
these amendment to the vocational_rehabilitation_act were design to help provide_for more specialized rehabilitation facility , for more sheltered_workshop and `` halfway '' workshop , for greater number of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individual ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvement to increase the program 's overall effectiveness . 
under the law as it exist until 1943 , the federal_government make grant to the state on the basis of population , match state expenditure on a fifty-fifty basis . 
under public_law 113 , group , the federal_government assume responsibility for 100  of necessary state expenditure in_connection_with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50  of the necessary cost of provide client with rehabilitation case services . 
throughout these year , the statutory authorization be for such sum as be necessary to carry_out the provision of the act . 
the 1954 amendment completely change the financing of the vocational_rehabilitation_program , provide_for a three part grant structure - for ( 1 ) basic support ; ( 2 ) extension and improvement ; and ( 3 ) research , demonstration , training and traineeship for vocational_rehabilitation - and in_addition for short-term training and instruction . 
the first part of the new structure - that for support the basic program of vocational_rehabilitation services - is describe in this section . 
subsequent section on grant describe the other category of the grant structure . 
the following table show , for selected year , the authorization , appropriation , allotment base , federal grant to state and state matching_funds for this part of the grant program . 
in_order to assist the state in maintain basic vocational_rehabilitation services , section 2 of the amended act provide that allotment to state for support of such services be base on ( 1 ) need , as measure by a state 's population , and ( 2 ) fiscal capacity , as measure by its per_capita income . 
the act further provide for a `` floor '' or minimum allotment , set at the 1954 level , which is call the `` base '' allotment , and a `` ceiling '' or maximum allotment , for each state . 
it stipulate , in_addition , that all amount remain as_a_result_of impose the `` ceiling '' , and not use for insure the `` floor '' , be redistribute to those state still below their maximum . 
these provision are design to reflect the difference in wealth and population among the state , with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person have access to needed services regardless of whether he reside in a state with a low or high per_capita income or a sparsely or thickly populated state . 
the provision are also design to avoid disruption in state program already in_operation , which might otherwise result from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population alone . 
the method use in compute the allotment is specifically set_forth in the act . 
the term `` state '' mean the several state , the district_of_columbia , the virgin_islands , guam and puerto_rico ; the term `` united_states '' include the several state and the district_of_columbia , and exclude the virgin_islands , guam and puerto_rico , and , prior to 1962 , alaska and hawaii . 
the following step are employ in calculation : 
for each state ( except puerto_rico , guam , the virgin_islands , and , prior to 1962 , alaska and hawaii ) determine average per_capita income based_on the last three year . 
( see source_of_data , below for per_capita income data to be use in this step . ) 
determine the average per_capita income for the u.s. based_on the last three year . 
( see source of data , below , for per_capita income data to be use in this step . ) 
determine the ratio of 50  to the average per_capita income of the u.s. ( divide 50 by the result obtain in item 2 above . ) 
determine for each state ( except the virgin_islands , guam and puerto_rico , and , prior to 1962 , alaska and hawaii ) that percentage which bear the same ratio to 50  as the particular state 's average per_capita income bear to the average per_capita income of the u.s. . 
( multiply the result obtain in item 3 above by the result obtain for each state in item 1 above . ) 
determine the particular state 's `` allotment percentage '' . 
by law this be 75  for the virgin_islands , guam and puerto_rico . 
( alaska and hawaii have fixed allotment percentage in_effect prior to fiscal_year 1962 . ) 
in all other state it be the difference obtain by subtract from 100 the result obtain in item 4 above ; except that no state shall have an allotment percentage less_than 33 - 1 3  nor more_than 75  . 
if the resulting difference for the particular state be less_than or more_than these extreme , the state 's allotment percentage must be raise or lower to the appropriate extreme . 
square each state 's allotment percentage . 
determine each state 's population . 
( see source of data , below for population data to be use in this step . ) 
multiply the population of each state by the square of its allotment percentage . 
( multiply result obtain in item 7 above , by result obtain in item 6 above . ) 
determine the sum of the product obtain in item 8 above , for all the state . 
( for each state , make all computation set_forth in item 1 to 8 above , and_then add the result obtain for each state in item 8 . ) 
determine the ratio that the amount being allot be to the sum of the product for all the state . 
( divide the amount being allot by the result obtain in item 9 above . ) 
determine the particular state 's unadjusted allotment for the particular fiscal_year . 
( multiply the state product in item 8 above by the result obtain in item 10 above . ) 
determine if the particular state 's unadjusted allotment ( result obtain in item 11 above ) be great than its maximum allotment , and if so lower its unadjusted allotment to its maximum allotment . 
( each state 's unadjusted allotment for any fiscal_year , which exceed its minimum allotment describe in item 13 below by a percentage great than one and half times the percentage by which the sum being allot exceed $ 23000000 , must be reduce by the amount of the excess . ) 
determine if the particular state 's unadjusted allotment ( result obtain in item 11 above ) be less_than its minimum ( base ) allotment , and if so raise its unadjusted allotment to its minimum allotment . 
regardless of its unadjusted allotment , each state is guarantee by law a minimum allotment each_year equal to the allotment which it receive in fiscal_year 1954 - increase by a uniform percentage of 5.4865771 which bring total 1954 allotment to all state up to $ 23000000 . 
the funds recoup by reduction in item 12 above are use : first , to increase the unadjusted allotment to the specified minimum in those state where the unadjusted allotment be less than the minimum allotment ( item 13 above ) ; and second , to increase uniformly the allotment to those state whose allotment be below their maximum , with adjustment to prevent the allotment of any state from thereby exceed its maximum . 
for the state which maintain two separate agency - one for the vocational rehabilitation of the blind , and one for the rehabilitation of person other_than the blind - the act specify that their minimum ( base ) allotment shall be divide between the two agency in the same proportion as it was divide in fiscal_year 1954 . 
funds allot in_addition to their minimum allotment are apportion to the two agency as they may determine . 
as be the case with the allotment provision for support of vocational rehabilitation services , the match requirement are also base on a statutory formula . 
prior to 1960 , in_order to provide matching_funds for the minimum ( base ) allotment , state funds have to equal 1954 state funds . 
prior to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is match at rate related_to the fiscal capacity of the state , with a pivot of 40  state ( or 60  federal ) participation in total program cost . 
the percentage of federal participation in such cost for any state is refer to in the law as that state 's `` federal share '' . 
for purpose of this explanation , this percentage is refer to as the state `` unadjusted federal share '' . 
begin in 1960 , the match requirement for the base allotment are being adjust ( upward or downward , as_required ) 25  per_year , so that by 1963 the entire support allotment will be match on the basis of a 40  pivot state share , with maximum and minimum state share of 50  and 30  , respectively . 
the pre 1960 rate of federal participation with_respect_to any state 's base allotment , as_well_as the adjusted rate in_effect during the 1960 - 1962 period , is designate by the statute as that state 's `` adjusted federal share '' . 
the provision for determine a state 's unadjusted federal share are design to reflect the varying financial resource among the state . 
the purpose of the adjusted federal share relate to the base allotment and of the transition provision for reach the unadjusted federal share be to prevent dislocation from abrupt_change in match rate . 
the method use for compute the respective federal and state share in total program cost is specifically set_forth in the act . 
the term `` state '' mean the several state , the district_of_columbia , the virgin_islands , guam and puerto_rico ; the term `` united_states '' include the several state and the district_of_columbia and exclude the virgin_islands , guam and puerto_rico , and , prior to 1962 , alaska and hawaii . 
the following step are employ in the calculation : 
for each state ( except the virgin_islands , guam , puerto_rico , and , prior to 1962 , alaska and hawaii ) , determine the average per_capita income for the last three year . 
( the same amount use in item 1 under method of compute allotment , above . ) 
determine the average per_capita income for the united_states for the last three year . 
( the same amount use in item 2 under method of compute allotment , above . ) 
determine the ratio of 40  to the average per_capita income of the united_states . 
( divide 40 by the amount use in item 2 above . ) 
determine for each state ( except the virgin_islands , guam , puerto_rico , and , prior to 1962 , alaska and hawaii ) , that percentage which bear the same ratio to 40  as the particular state 's average per_capita income bear to the average per_capita income of the united_states . 
( multiply the result obtain in item 3 above by the amount use for each state in item 1 above . ) 
determine the particular state 's `` federal share '' . 
by law this be 70  for the virgin_islands , guam and puerto_rico . 
( alaska and hawaii have fixed federal share percentage in_effect prior to fiscal_year 1962 . ) 
in all other state it be the difference obtain by subtract from 100 the result obtain in item 4 above ; except that no state shall have a federal share less_than 50  nor more_than 70  . 
if the resulting difference for the particular state be less_than or more_than these extreme , the state 's federal share must be raise or lower to the appropriate extreme . 
at the entrance side of the shelter , each roof beam is rest_on the inside 4 inch of the block wall . 
the outside 4 - inch space is fill by mortar block on edge . 
the wooden bracing between the roof beam is place flush with the inside of the wall . 
mortar is pour between this bracing and the 4 - inch block on edge to complete the wall thickness for radiation shielding . 
( for detail see inset , fig 5 . ) 
the first one or two roof board ( mark `` e '' in fig 6 ) are slip into place across the roof beam , from outside the shelter . 
these board are nail to the roof beam by reach up through the open space between the beam , from inside the shelter . 
concrete block are pass between the beam and put on the board . 
the roof block be in two layer and are not mortar together . 
work on the roof continue in this way . 
the last roof board are cover with block from outside the shelter . 
when the roof block be all in_place , the final row of wall block are mortar into position . 
the structure be complete . 
( see fig 7 . ) 
building plan be on page 21 . 
solid concrete block , relatively heavy and dense , are use for this shelter . 
these block are sell in various size so it seldom be necessary to cut a block to fit . 
solid block are recommend because hollow block would have_to be fill with concrete to give effective protection . 
brick be an alternative . 
if they are use , the wall and roof should be 10 inch thick to give the same protection as the 8 - inch solid concrete block . 
the illustration in fig 8 show how to lay a concrete block wall . 
more detailed instructions may be obtain from your local building_supply_house and craftsman . 
other source of information include the group , 38 location , chicago , illinois , the group , 33 location , chicago , illinois , and the group , washington , dc . 
an outdoor , aboveground fallout_shelter also may be build with concrete block . 
( see fig 9 , double wall shelter . ) 
most people would have_to hire a contractor to build this shelter . 
plan be on page 22 and 23 . 
this shelter could be build in region where water or rock be close to the surface , make it impractical to build an underground shelter . 
two wall of concrete block are construct at_least 20 inch apart . 
the space between them is fill with pit_run gravel or earth . 
the wall are hold together with metal tie place in the wet mortar as the wall are build . 
the roof show here ( fig 9 ) be a 6 - inch slab of reinforced_concrete , cover with at_least 20 inch of pit_run gravel . 
an alternate roof , perhaps more within do-it-yourself reach , could be construct of heavy wooden roof beam , overlay with board and waterproofing . 
it would have_to be cover with at_least 28 inch of pit_run gravel . 
the material for a double wall shelter would cost about $ 700 . 
contractor ' charge would be additional . 
the shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection . 
pre shaped corrugated metal section or precast concrete can be use for shelter either above or below ground . 
these be particularly suitable for region where water or rock be close to the surface . 
they form effective fallout_shelter when mound_over with earth , as show in figure 10 . 
material for this shelter would cost about $ 700 . 
a contractor probably would be require to help build it . 
his charge would be add to the cost of material . 
this shelter , as show on page 24 , would provide almost absolute protection from fallout radiation . 
an alternate hatchway entrance , show on page 25 , would reduce the cost of material $ 50 to $ 100 . 
the group , washington , dc , is develop plan to utilize specially treated lumber for underground shelter construction . 
the group , washington , dc , is work to develop brick and clay product suitable for shelter construction . 
an underground reinforced_concrete shelter can be build by a contractor for about $ 1000 to $ 1500 , depending_on the type of entrance . 
the shelter show would provide almost absolute fallout protection . 
the illustration ( fig 11 ) show this shelter with the roof at ground_level and mounded_over . 
the same shelter could be build into an embankment or below ground_level . 
plan for the shelter , with either a stairway or hatchway entrance , are show on page 26 and 27 . 
another type of shelter which give excellent fallout protection can be build as an added room to the basement of a home under construction . 
it would add about $ 500 to the total cost of the home . 
the shelter illustrate in figure 12 be based on such a room build in a new home in the washington , dc area in the spring of 1959 . 
important consideration common to each type of shelter be : 
arrangement of the entrance . 
ventilation . 
radio reception . 
lighting . 
the entrance must have at_least one right_angle turn . 
radiation scatter somewhat like light . 
some will go around a corner . 
the rest continue in a straight_line . 
therefore , sharp turn in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter . 
ventilation is provide in a concrete block basement shelter by vent in the wall and by the open entrance . 
a blower may be install to increase comfort . 
a blower be essential for the double wall shelter and for the underground shelter . 
it should provide not less_than 5 cubic_foot per minute of air per person . 
vent pipe also be necessary ( as show in fig 9 , 10 , and 11 ) , but filter be not . 
radio reception is cut_down by the shielding necessary to keep_out radiation . 
as_soon_as the shelter is complete a radio reception check must be make . 
it probably will be necessary to install an outside antenna , particularly to receive conelrad broadcast . 
lighting be an important consideration . 
continuous low-level lighting may be provide in the shelter by_means_of a 4 - cell hot-shot battery to which is wire a 150 - milliampere flashlight type bulb . 
test have show that such a device , with a fresh battery , will furnish light continuously for at_least 10 day . 
with a spare battery , a source of light for 2 week or more would be assure . 
a flashlight or electric lantern also should be available for those period when a bright light is need . 
there should be a regular electric_outlet in the shelter as power may continue in many area . 
other consideration . 
- if there be outside window in the basement corner where you build a shelter , they should be shield as show in the appendix , page 29 . 
other basement window should be block when an emergency threaten . 
basement wall that project above the ground should be shield as show in the appendix , page 29 . 
in these shelter the entrance should be not more_than 2 foot wide . 
bunk , or material to build them , may have_to be put inside the enclosure before the shelter wall are complete . 
the basement or belowground shelter also will serve for tornado or hurricane protection . 
the radioactivity of fallout decay rapidly at_first . 
forty-nine hour after an atomic burst the radiation intensity be only about 1 percent of what it be an hour after the explosion . 
but the radiation may be so intense at_the_start that one_percent may be extremely dangerous . 
therefore , civil_defense instruction receive over conelrad or by other means should be follow . 
a battery powered radio be essential . 
radiation instrument suitable for home use be available , and would be of_value in locate that portion of the home which offer the best protection against fallout radiation . 
there be a possibility that battery powered radio with built-in radiation meter may become available . 
one instrument thus would serve both purpose . 
your local civil_defense will gather its own information and will receive broad information from state and federal source . 
it will tell you as_soon_as possible : 
how long to stay in your shelter . 
how soon you may go outdoors . 
how long you may stay outside . 
you should be prepared to stay in your shelter full-time for at_least several day and to make it your home for 14 day or longer . 
a checklist in the appendix , ( page 30 ) tell what is need . 
family with child will have particular problem . 
they should provide_for simple recreation . 
there should be a task for everyone and these task should be rotate . 
part of the family should be sleep while the rest be awake . 
to break the monotony it may be necessary to invent task that will keep the family busy . 
record such_as diary can be keep . 
the survival of the family will depend largely on information receive by radio . 
a record should be keep of the information and instruction , include the time and date of broadcast . 
family rationing probably will be necessary . 
blower should be operate periodically on a regular schedule . 
there will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation has decay enough to allow use of the whole basement . 
however , as much time as possible should be spend within the shelter to hold radiation exposure to a minimum . 
the housekeeping problem of live in a shelter will begin as_soon_as the shelter is occupy . 
food , medical supplies , utensil , and equipment , if not already store in the shelter , must be quickly gather_up and carry into it . 
after the family has settle in the shelter , the housekeeping rule should be spell_out by the adult in charge . 
sanitation in the confines of the family shelter will require much thought and planning . 
provision for emergency toilet facility and disposal of human_waste will be an unfamiliar problem . 
a covered container such_as a kitchen garbage pail might do as a toilet . 
a 10 - gallon garbage_can , with a tightly_fitting cover , could be use to keep the waste until it be safe to leave the shelter . 
water rationing will be difficult and should be plan carefully . 
a portable electric_heater be advisable for shelter in cold climate . 
it would take the chill from the shelter in the beginning . 
even if the electric_power fail after an attack , any time that the heater has been use will make the shelter that_much more comfortable . 
body heat in the close quarters will help keep_up the temperature . 
warm clothing and bedding , of_course , be essential . 
open flame heating or cooking should be avoid . 
a flame would use_up air . 
some family already have hold weekend rehearsal in their home shelter to learn the problem and to determine for themselves what supplies they would need . 
few area , if any , be as_good_as prepared shelter but they be worth know about . 
a family dwelling without a basement provide some natural shielding from fallout radiation . 
on the ground_floor the radiation would be about half what it be outside . 
the best protection would be on the ground_floor in the central part of the house . 
a belowground basement can cut the fallout radiation to one tenth of the outside level . 
the safe place be the basement corner least exposed to window and deep below ground . 
if there be time after the warning , the basement shielding could be improve substantially by block window with brick , dirt , book , magazine , or other heavy material . 
large apartment_building of masonry or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual family dwelling . 
in_general , such apartment afford more protection than smaller building because their wall be thick and there be more space . 
the central area of the ground_floor of a heavily construct apartment_building , with concrete floor , should provide more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling . 
the basement of such an apartment_building may provide as much natural protection as the specially construct concrete block shelter recommend for the basement of a family dwelling . 
the federal_government is aid local_government in several place to survey residential , commercial and industrial building to determine what fallout protection they would provide , and for how many person . 
the problem for the city apartment dweller be primarily to plan the use of existing space . 
such planning will require the cooperation of other occupant and of the apartment management . 
a former group official become a group vice_president and set_about maximize group 's share of the group market . 
line of communication were establish between the two company and several group product were actively promote . 
within a_few year various group manufactured item were fill the entire requirement of from four to seven of group ' eight operating division . 
the group division , long control by the person brother under a voting_trust even though group own a majority of its stock , follow an independent course for many year , but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance had collapse '' and its purchase from group `` compare favorably '' with purchase by other group division . 
competitor come to receive high percentage of group business in later year , but it be `` likely '' that this trend stem `` at_least in part '' from the need of group outstrip group 's capacity . 
`` the fact that stick_out in this voluminous record be that the bulk of group 's production has always supply the large part of the requirement of the one customer in the automobile_industry connect to group by a stock interest . 
the inference be overwhelming that group 's commanding position was promote by its stock interest and was not gain solely on competitive merit '' . 
353_u._s._,_at_605 . 
this court agree with the trial_court `` that consideration of price , quality and service were not overlook by either group or group '' . 
353_u._s._,_at_606 . 
however , it determine that neither this factor , nor `` the fact that all concerned in high executive post in both company act honorably and fairly , each in the honest conviction that his action be in the best interest of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone , include group 's competitor '' , 353_u._s._,_at_607 , outweigh the government 's claim for relief . 
this claim , as submit to the group and dismiss by it , 126_f._supp .235 , allege violation not_only of 7 of the clayton_act , but also of 1 and 2 of the group . 
the latter provision proscribe any contract , combination_in_restraint_of_trade , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempt , combination , or conspiracy to monopolize , such trade . 
however , this court put to one side without consideration the government 's appeal from the dismissal of its sherman_act allegation . 
it rest_on its decision solely on 7 , which read in pertinent part : `` [ n_]_o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engage also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquire and the corporation make the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce . 
this section shall not apply to corporation purchase such stock solely for investment and not use the same by vote or otherwise to bring_about , or in attempt to bring_about , the substantial lessening of competition `` . 
the purpose of_this provision was thus explain in the court 's opinion : `` section 7 is design to arrest in its incipiency not_only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraint or monopoly in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation . 
the section is violate whether or not actual restraint or monopoly , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occur or are intend '' . 
353_u._s._,_at_589 . 
thus , a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was exclude from the court 's decision . 
indeed , as already note , the court proceed on the assumption that the executive involved in the dealing between group and group act `` honorably and fairly '' and exercise their business judgment only to serve what they deem the best interest of their own company . 
this , however , did not bar find that group had become preeminent as a supplier of automotive fabric and finish to group ; that these product constitute a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the clayton_act ; that group ' share of the market for these product be substantial ; and that competition for this share of the market was endanger by the financial relationship between the two concern : 
`` the statutory policy of foster free competition is obviously further when no supplier have an advantage over his competitor from an acquisition of his customer 's stock likely to have the effect condemn by the statute . 
we repeat , that the test of a violation of 7 be whether , at the time of suit , there be a reasonable probability that the acquisition be likely to result in the condemned restraint . 
the conclusion upon this record be inescapable that such likelihood was prove as to this acquisition '' . 
353_u._s._,_at_607 . 
on the basis of the finding which lead to this conclusion , the court remand the case to the group to determine the appropriate relief . 
the sole guidance give the court for discharge the task commit to it be this : `` the judgment must therefore be reverse and the case remand to the group for a determination , after further hearing , of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effect of the acquisition offensive to the statute . 
the group , in the framing of equitable decree , are clothe ' with large discretion to model their judgment to fit the exigency of the particular case ' . 
international_salt_co._v._united_states_,_332_u._s._392_,_400_-_401 '' . 
353_u._s._,_at_607_-_608 . 
this bring us to the course of the proceedings in the group . 
this court 's judgment was file in the group on july 18 , 1957 . 
the first pretrial conference - hold to appoint amicus_curiae to represent the interest of the stockholder of group and group and to consider the procedure to be follow in the subsequent hearing - take_place on september 25 , 1957 . 
at the outset , the government 's spokesman explain that counsel for the government and for group had already hold preliminary discussion with a view to arrive at a relief plan that both side could recommend to the court . 
group , he say , had propose disenfranchisement of its group stock along with other restriction on the group relationship . 
the government , deem these suggestion inadequate , had urge that any judgment include divestiture of group 's share of group . 
counsel for the government invite group 's view on this proposal before recommend a specific program , but state that if the court desire , or if counsel for group think further discussion would not be profitable , the government be prepared to submit a plan within thirty day . 
counsel for group indicate a preference for the submission of detailed plan by both side at an early date . 
no previous antitrust_case , he say , had involve interest of such magnitude or present such complex problem of relief . 
the submission of detailed plan would place the issue before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement in the abstract . 
the court adopt this procedure with an appropriate time schedule for carry_out it out . 
the government submit its proposed decree on october 25 , 1957 . 
the plan call_for divestiture by group of its 63000000 share of group stock by equal annual distribution to its stockholder , as a dividend , over a period of ten year . 
group and group , major stockholder in group , and the stockholder of group were deal with specially by provision require the annual sale by a trustee , again over a ten year period , of group 's group stock allocable to them , as_well_as any group stock which group and group own outright . 
if , in the trustee 's judgment , `` reasonable market condition '' did not prevail during any given year , he was to be allow to petition the court for an extension of time within the ten year period . 
in_addition , the right_to_vote the group stock hold by group was to be vest in group 's stockholder , other_than group and group and the stockholder of group ; group , group , and group were to be enjoin from acquire stock in or exercise control over group ; group , group , and group were to be prohibit to have any director or officer in_common with group , and vice_versa ; and group and group were to be order to terminate any agreement that provide_for the purchase by group of any specified percentage of its requirement of any group manufactured product , or for the grant of exclusive patent_right , or for a grant by group to group of a preferential right to make or sell any chemical discovery of group , or for the maintenance of any joint commercial_enterprise by the two company . 
on motion of the amicus_curiae , the court direct that a ruling be obtain from the person as to the federal income_tax consequence of the government 's plan . 
on may 9 , 1958 , the commissioner announce his ruling . 
the annual dividend pay to group stockholder in share of group stock would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of group 's earnings and profits . 
the measure , for federal income_tax purpose , of the dividend to individual stockholder would be the fair market_value of the share at the time of each annual distribution . 
in the case of taxpaying corporate stockholder , the measure would be the lesser of the fair market_value of the share or group 's tax basis for them , which be approximately $ 2.09 per share . 
the forced_sale of the group stock own by or allocable to group , group , and the stockholder of group , and deposit with the trustee , would result in a tax to those party at the capital_gain rate . 
group 's counterproposal was file on may 14 , 1958 . 
under its plan group would retain its group share but be require to pass_on to its stockholder the right_to_vote those share . 
group and group would , in_turn , be require to pass_on the voting_right to the group share allocable to them to their own stockholder . 
group would be enjoin from have as a director , officer , or employee anyone who be simultaneously an officer or employee of group , and no director , officer , or employee of group could serve as a director of group without court approval . 
group would be deny the right to acquire any additional group stock except through group ' distribution of stock or subscription_right to its stockholder . 
on june 6 , 1958 , group submit its objection to the government 's proposal . 
it argue , inter_alia , that a divestiture order would severely depress the market_value of the stock of both group and group , with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundred of thousand of innocent investor , among them thousand of small trust and charitable institution ; that there would be a similar decline in the market_value of other automotive and chemical stock , with similar loss to the stockholder of those company ; that the tremendous volume of group stock hang over the market for ten year would hamper the effort of group and other automobile manufacturer to raise equity capital ; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock_market and on general business_activity . 
group comprehensively contend that the government plan would not be `` in the public interest '' as_required by the mandate of_this court . 
the decree propose by the amicus_curiae were file in august of 1958 . 
these plan , like group 's contain provision for pass the vote on group 's group share on to the ultimate stockholder of group , group , and group , except that officer and director of the three company , their spouse , and other people live in their household , as_well_as other specified person , were to be totally disenfranchise . 
both plan also prohibit common director , officer , or employee between group , group , and group , on_the_one_hand , and group on_the_other_hand . 
it is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense '' to believe that husband and wife should not be subject to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permit to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship . 
while it is easy enough to ridicule person ' pronouncement in pleas_of_the_crown from a metaphysical point_of_view , the concept of the `` oneness '' of a married_couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife be such_that their action be not always to be regard by the criminal_law as if there be no marriage . 
by make inroad in the name of law_enforcement into the protection which congress has afford to the marriage relationship , the court today continue in the path chart by the recent decision in wyatt_v._united_states , 362_u._s._525 , where the court hold that , under_the_circumstances of that case , a wife could be compel to testify against her husband over her objection . 
one need not waver in his belief in virile law_enforcement to insist that there are other thing in american life which be also of great importance , and to which even law_enforcement must accommodate itself . 
one of these be the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage . 
the court 's opinion dogmatically assert that the husband wife conspiracy doctrine does not in_fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrone [ s ] an unreality into a rule of law '' . 
i am not easily persuade that a rule accept by so many people for so many century can be so lightly dismiss . 
but in_any_event , i submit that the power to depose belong_to congress , not to this court . 
i dissent . 
petitioner , who claim to be a conscientious_objector , was convict of violate 12 ( a ) of the universal_military_training_and_service_act by refuse to be induct into the armed_forces . 
he claim that he was deny due_process_of_law in violation of the fifth_amendment , because ( 1 ) at a hearing before a hearing_officer of the group he was not permit to rebut statement attribute to him by the local board , and ( 2 ) at the trial , he was deny the right to have the hearing_officer 's report and the original report of the group as to his claim . 
hold : on the record in this case , the administrative procedure prescribed by the act were fully comply with ; petitioner was not deny due_process ; and his conviction is sustain . 
pp. 60 - 66 . 
petitioner was not deny due_process in the administrative proceedings , because the statement in_question be in his file , to which he have access , and he have opportunity to rebut it both before the hearing_officer of the group and before the appeal_board . 
pp. 62 - 63 . 
petitioner was not entitle to have the hearing_officer 's note and report , especially since he fail to show any particular need for them and he did have a copy of the group 's recommendation to the appeal_board . 
pp. 63 - 64 . 
petitioner was not entitle , either in the administrative hearing at the group or at his trial , to inspect the original report of the group , since he was furnish a resume of it , did not challenge its accuracy , and show no particular need for the original report . 
pp. 64 - 66 . 
person argue the cause and file a brief for petitioner . 
person argue the cause for the united_states . 
on the brief be person , person , person and person . 
person deliver the opinion of the court . 
this be a prosecution for refusal to be induct into the armed_service , in violation of the provision of the universal_military_training_and_service_act , 62_stat._604_,_622_,_50_u._s._c._app._462_(_a ) . 
petitioner , who claim to be a conscientious_objector , contend that he was deny due_process , both in the proceedings before a hearing_officer of the group and at trial . 
he say that he was not permit to rebut before the hearing_officer statement attribute to him by the local board , and , further , that he was deny at trial the right to have the group hearing_officer 's report and the original report of the group as to his claim - all in violation of the fifth_amendment . 
the trial_judge decide that the administrative procedure of the act were fully comply with and refuse to require the production of such document . 
petitioner was find guilty and sentence to 15 month ' imprisonment . 
the group affirm . 
269_f._2_d_613 . 
we grant certiorari in view of the importance of the question in the administration of the act . 
361_u._s._899 . 
we have conclude that petitioner 's claim are control by the rationale of gonzales_v._united_states , 348_u._s._407_(_1955_) , and united_states_v._nugent , 346_u._s .1_(_1953 ) , and therefore affirm the judgment . 
petitioner register with group , location , on march 17th , 1952 . 
his answer to the classification questionnaire reflect that he be a minister of group , employ at night by a sugar producer . 
he claim 4_,_-_d classification as a minister of religion , devote a minimum of 100 hour a month to preaching . 
on november 13th , 1952 , he was classify in class 1 , -_a . 
on november 22 , 1952 , he write the group , protest this classification . 
he again state that he be `` a regular minister '' ; that he was `` devote an average of 100 hour a month to actually preach publicly '' , in_addition to 50 to 75 hour in other ministerial duty , and that he oppose war in any form . 
thereafter he was classify 1_,_-_o . 
on april 1st , 1953 , after some six month of full-time `` pioneering '' , petitioner discontinue devote 100 hour a month to preaching , but fail to so notify his local board . 
in a periodic review , the local board on july 30th , 1953 , reclassify him 1_,_-_a and uphold this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner , because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home . 
upon administrative approval of the reclassification , he was order to report for induction on june 11th , 1956 , but fail to do so . 
he was not prosecute , however , and his case was subsequently reopen , in the light of sicurella_v._united_states , 348_u._s._385_(_1955_) . 
he was again reclassify 1_,_-_a by the local board . 
there follow a customary group hearing , at which petitioner appear . 
in his report to the person , the hearing_officer suggest that the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service . 
on march 21 , 1957 , however , the group recommend approval of the 1_,_-_a classification . 
its ground for this recommendation be that , while petitioner claim before the local board august 17th , 1956 ( as evidence by its memorandum in his file of that date ) , that he was devote 100 hour per month to actual preaching , the headquarters of the group report that he was no_longer do so and , on_the_contrary , had relinquish both his pioneer_and_bible_student_servant position . 
it report that he now devote only some 6 - 12 hour per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hour per month to church activity . 
his claim be therefore `` so highly exaggerate '' , the group conclude , that it `` cast doubt upon his veracity and , consequently , upon his sincerity and good_faith '' . 
the appeal_board furnish petitioner a copy of the recommendation . 
in his answer thereto , he advise the board that he had make no such statement in 1956 , and assert that his only claim to `` pioneering '' be in 1952 . 
the appeal_board , however , unanimously concur in the group 's recommendation . 
upon return of the file to the local board , petitioner was again order to report for induction and this prosecution follow his failure to do so . 
petitioner first contend that the group deny him procedural due_process by not give him timely opportunity , before its final recommendation to the appeal_board , to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of devote 100 hour to actual preaching . 
but the statement of the local board attribute this claim to petitioner be in his file . 
he admit that he know it be open to him at all time , and he could have rebut it before the hearing_officer . 
this he fail to do , assert that he did not know it to be in his file . 
apparently he never take the trouble to find_out . 
nevertheless he have ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal_board . 
after the recommendation of the group is forward to the appeal_board , that be the appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial . 
this he do . 
we find in gonzales_v._united_states , supra , that this be the control reason why copy of the recommendation should be furnish a registrant . 
we say there that it be necessary `` that a registrant be give an opportunity to rebut [ the group 's ] recommendation when it come to the appeal_board , the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification '' . 
348_u._s._,_at_412 . 
we fail to see how such procedure result in any prejudice to petitioner 's contention , which was consider by the appeal board and deny by it . 
as was say in gonzales , `` it be the appeal_board which render the selective_service determination consider ' final ' in the court , not to be overturn unless there is no basis in fact . 
estep_v._united_states , 327_u._s._114_'' . 
348_u._s._,_at_412_-_413 . 
but there are other contention which might be consider more difficult . 
at his trial , petitioner seek to secure through subpoena_duces_tecum the longhand note of the group 's hearing_officer , person , as_well as his report thereon . 
petitioner also claim at trial the right to inspect the original group report to the group . 
he allege no specific procedural error or evidence withhold ; nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the group report might disclose . 
section 6_(_j_) of the act , as we have hold , does require the group 's recommendation to be place in a registrant 's file . 
gonzales_v._united_states , supra . 
but there is nothing in the act require the hearing_officer 's report to be likewise turn_over to the registrant . 
while the regulation formerly require that the hearing_officer 's report be place in the registrant 's file , this requirement was eliminate in 1952 . 
moreover , the hearing_officer 's report be but intradepartmental , is direct to the person and , of_course , be not the recommendation of the group . 
it be not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the group , of which the person receive many , and to which he may give his approval or rejection . 
it be but part of the whole process within the group that go_into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board . 
it be also significant that neither this report nor the hearing_officer 's note were furnish to the appeal board . 
hence the petitioner have full opportunity to traverse the only conclusion of the group on file with the group . 
petitioner know that the group 's recommendation was base not on the hearing_officer 's report but on the statement of the local board in his file . 
having have every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local board before both the hearing_officer and the appeal board , petitioner cannot now claim that he was deny due_process because he did not succeed . 
it appear to us that the same reasoning apply to the production of the hearing_officer 's report and note at the trial . 
in_addition , petitioner has fail to show any particular need for the report and note . 
while there be now allegation of the withholding of `` favorable evidence develop at the hearing '' and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing '' , no such claim was make by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process . 
moreover , his testimony at trial never develop any such fact . 
in the light of these circumstance , as_well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect center_on entirely on the group 's recommendation , which petitioner repudiate but which both the appeal board and the court below find support by the record , we find no relevancy in the hearing_officer 's report and note . 
finally petitioner say that he was entitled to inspect the group report during the proceedings before the hearing_officer as_well as at the trial . 
he did receive a resume of it - the same that was furnish the appeal board - and he make no claim of its inaccuracy . 
even now no such claim is assert . 
he base his present contention on the general right to explore , indicate that he hope to find some discrepancy in the resume . 
but this is fully answer by united_states_v._nugent , supra . 
there we hold `` that the statutory scheme for review , within the selective_service_system , entitle [ conscientious_objector ] to no guarantee that the group report must be produce for their inspection '' . 
346_u._s._,_at_5_-_6 . 
even if we were not bound by nugent , petitioner here would not be entitle to the report . 
the recommendation of the group - as_well as the decision of the appeal board - was base entirely on the local board file , not on an group report . 
with this enlarged role in mind , i should_like to make a_few suggestion : what we in the united_states do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happen in the rest of the world . 
we in this department must think_about foreign_policy in its total context . 
we cannot regard foreign_policy as something left_over after defense_policy or trade_policy or fiscal_policy has been extract . 
foreign_policy be the total involvement of the american people with people and government abroad . 
that mean that , if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership , we must think in_terms_of the total context of our situation . 
it be the concern of the department_of_state that the american people be safe and secure - defense be not a monopoly concern of the department_of_defense . 
it be also the concern of the department_of_state that our trading relationship with the rest of the world be vigorous , profitable , and active - this be not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the department_of_commerce . 
we can no_longer rely_on interdepartmental machinery `` somewhere upstairs '' to resolve difference between this and other department . 
person will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination of policy . 
means must be find to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleague in other department concerned with foreign_policy . 
i think we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action . 
every policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer . 
unless we keep our eye on the horizon ahead , we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present . 
the movement of event be so fast , the pace so severe , that an attempt to peer into the future be essential if we are to think accurately about the present . 
if there be anything which we can do in the executive_branch of the government to speed_up the process by which we come_to decision on matter on_which we must act promptly , that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of our affairs . 
action take today be often far more valuable than action take several month later in response to a situation then out of control . 
there will of_course be time for delay and inaction . 
what i am suggest be that when we delay , or when we fail to act , we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic or procedural difficulty . 
i also hope that we can do something about reduce the infant_mortality_rate of idea - an affliction of all bureaucracy . 
we want to stimulate idea from the bottom to the top of the department . 
we want to make sure that our junior colleague realize that idea be welcome , that initiative go_down right down to the bottom and go all_the_way to the top . 
i hope no one expect that only presidential appointee are look_upon as source of idea . 
the responsibility for take the initiative in generate idea be that of every officer in the department who have a policy function , regardless of rank . 
further , i would hope that we could pay_attention to little thing . 
while observe the operation of our government in various part of the world , i have feel that in many situation where our policy be good we have tend to ignore minor problem which spoil our main effort . 
to cite only a_few example : 
the wrong man in the wrong position , perhaps even in a junior position abroad , can be a source of great harm to our policy ; the attitude of a un delegate who experience difficulty in find adequate housing in new_york_city , or of a foreign diplomat in similar circumstance in our capital , can be easily be direct against the united_states and all that it stand_for . 
dozens of seemingly small matter go_wrong all_over the world . 
sometimes those who know about them be too far down the line to be able to do anything about them . 
i would hope that we could create the recognition in the department and overseas that those who come_across little thing go_wrong have the responsibility for bring these to the attention of those who can do something about them . 
if the department_of_state is to take primary responsibility for foreign_policy in washington , it follow that the ambassador is expect to take_charge overseas . 
this does not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active , operational , interested , responsible fashion . 
he is expect to know about what is go_on among the representative of other agency who are station in his country . 
he is expect to supervise , to encourage , to direct , to assist in any way he can . 
if any official operation abroad begin to go_wrong , we shall look_to the ambassador to find_out why and to get suggestion for remedial action . 
it occur to me that you might be interested in some thought which i express privately in recent year , in the hope of clear_up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign_policy be all about and what it mean , and of develop a certain compassion for those who are carry such responsibility inside government . 
i try to do so by call to their attention some of the problem that a senior departmental policy officer face . 
this mean practically everybody in this room . 
whether it will strike_home for you or not will be for you to determine . 
the senior policy officer may be move to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of stimulus : an idea in his own head , the suggestion of a colleague , a question from the secretary or the president , a proposal by another department , a communication from a foreign government or an american ambassador abroad , the filing of an item for the agenda of the united_nations or of any other of dozens of international body , a news_item read at the breakfast_table , a question to the president or the secretary at a news_conference , a speech by a senator or congressman , an article in a periodical , a resolution from a national organization , a request for assistance from some private american interest abroad , etcetera , ad_infinitum . 
the policy officer live with his antenna alert for the question which fall within his range of responsibility . 
his first thought be about the question itself : 
is there a question here for american foreign_policy , and , if so , what be it ? 
for he know that the first and sometimes most difficult job be to know what the question be - that when it is accurately identify it sometimes answer itself , and that the way in which it is pose frequently shape the answer . 
chew_over it over with his colleague and in his own mind , he reach a tentative identification of the question - tentative because it may change as he explore it further and because , if no tolerable answer can be find , it may have to be change into one which can be answer . 
meanwhile he has been think_about the fact surround the problem , fact which he know can never be complete , and the general background , much of which has already be lost to history . 
he be appreciative of the expert help available to him and draw these resource into play , take_care to examine at_least some of the raw_material which underlie their frequently policy oriented conclusion . 
he know that he must give the expert his place , but he know that he must also keep him in it . 
he is already begin to box the compass of alternative line of action , include do nothing . 
he know that he is think_about action in_relation_to a future which can be perceive but dimly through a merciful fog . 
but he take his bearing from the great guideline of policy , well established precedent , the commitment of the united_states under international charter and treaty , basic statute , and well understood notion of the american people about how we are to conduct ourselves , in policy literature such_as country papers and group papers accumulate in the department . 
he will not be surprised to find that general principle produce conflicting result in the factual situation with which he is confront . 
he must think_about which of these principle must take precedence . 
he will know that general policy papers write month before may not fit his problem because of crucial change in circumstance . 
he be aware that every moderately important problem merge imperceptibly into every other problem . 
he must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it cannot be handle without relation_to the whole - when the whole be too_large to grasp . 
he must think_of others who have a stake in the question and in its answer . 
who should be consult among his colleague in the department or other department and agency of the government ? 
which american ambassador could provide helpful advice ? 
be private interest sufficiently involved to be consult ? 
what be the probable attitude of other government , include those less directly involved ? 
how and at what stage and in what sequence are other government to be consult ? 
if action is indicate , what kind of action be relevant to the problem ? 
the selection of the wrong tool can mean waste , at_best , and at_worst an unwanted inflammation of the problem itself . 
can the president or the secretary act under existing authority , or will new legislation and new money be required ? 
should the action be unilateral or multilateral ? 
be the matter one for the united_nations or some_other international body ? 
for , if so , the path lead through a complex process of parliamentary diplomacy which add still another dimension to the problem . 
what type of action can hope to win public support , first in this country and then abroad ? 
for the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in_general the effectiveness of policy will be condition by the readiness of the country to sustain it . 
he be interested in public opinion for two reason : 
first , because it be important in itself , and , second , because he know that the american public care about a decent respect for the opinion of mankind . 
and , given probable public attitude - about which reasonably good estimate can be make - what action be called_for to insure necessary support ? 
may i add a caution on this particular point ? 
we do not want policy officer below the level of presidential appointee to concern themselves too_much with problem of domestic politics in recommend foreign_policy action . 
in_the_first_place our business be foreign_policy , and it be the business of the presidential leadership and his appointee in the department to consider the domestic political aspect of a problem . 
person emphasize this point by say , `` you fellow in the department_of_state do n't know much about domestic politics '' . 
this be an important consideration . 
if we sit here read editorial and look at public_opinion_poll and other report that cross our desk , we should realize that this be raw , undigested opinion expressed in the absence of leadership . 
what the american people will do turn_on in large degree on their leadership . 
we cannot test public_opinion until the president and the leaders of the country have go to the public to explain what be required and have ask them for support for the necessary action . 
i doubt , for_example , that , 3 month before the leadership begin to talk_about what come to be the marshall_plan , any public_opinion expert would have say that the country would have accept such proposal . 
the problem in the policy officer 's mind thus begin to take_shape as a galaxy of utterly complicated factor - political , military , economic , financial , legal , legislative , procedural , administrative - to be sort_out and handle within a political_system which move by consent in_relation_to an external environment which cannot be under_control . 
and the policy officer have the hounds of time snapping_at_his_heels . 
strategy and tactics of the u.s. military_force are now undergo one of the greatest transition in history . 
the change of emphasis from conventional type to missile type warfare must be make with care , mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglect in favor of the other . 
our military_force must be capable of contend successfully with any contingency which may be force upon us , from limited emergency to all-out nuclear general war . 
- this budget will provide_for in the fiscal_year 1961 for the continued support of our force at approximately the present level - a year-end strength of 2489000 man and woman in the active force . 
the force to be support include an army of 14 division and 870000 men ; a navy of 817 active ship and 619000 men ; a marine_corps of 3 division and 3 air wing with 175000 men ; and an air_force of 91 combat wing and 825000 men . 
if the reserve component are to serve effectively in time of war , their basic organization and objective must conform_to the changing character and mission of the active force . 
quality and combat readiness must take precedence over mere number . 
under modern condition , this be especially true of the ready reserves . 
i have request the secretary of defense to reexamine the role and mission of the reserve component in_relation_to those of the active force and in the light of the changing requirement of modern warfare . 
last year the congress discontinue its previously impose minimum personnel strength limitation on the group . 
similar restriction on the strength of the army national_guard contain in the 1960 department_of_defense appropriation_act should likewise be drop . 
i strongly recommend to the congress the avoidance of mandatory floor on the size of the reserve component so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustment in keep with military necessity . 
i again propose a reduction in the army national_guard and group - from their present strength of 400000 and 300000 , respectively , to 360000 and 270000 by the end of the fiscal_year 1961 . 
these strength are consider adequate to meet the essential role and mission of the reserves in support of our national security objective . 
- about 30  of the expenditure for the department_of_defense in 1961 be for military_personnel cost , include pay for active , reserve , and retired military_personnel . 
these expenditure are estimate to be $ 12.1 billion , an increase of $ 187 million over 1960 , reflect additional longevity pay of career personnel , more dependent , an increased number of men draw proficiency pay , and social_security tax increase ( effective for the full year in 1961 compare with only 6 month in 1960 ) . 
retired pay cost are increase by $ 94 million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel . 
these increased cost are partially offset by a decrease of $ 56 million in expenditure for the reserve force , largely because of the planned reduction in strength of the group component during 1961 . 
traditionally , rate_of_pay for retired military_personnel have be proportionate to current rate_of_pay for active personnel . 
the 1958 military pay act depart from this established formula by provide_for a 6  increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of june 1 , 1958 . 
i endorse pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay_rate . 
- expenditure for operate and maintain the station and equipment of the armed_forces are estimate to be $ 10.3 billion in 1961 , which be $ 184 million more than in 1960 . 
the increase stem largely from the grow complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for new weapon and equipment . 
a substantial increase is estimate in the cost of operate additional communication_system in the air defense_program , as_well as in all program where speed and security of communication be essential . 
also , the program for fleet modernization will be step_up in 1961 cause an increase in expenditure . 
further increase arise from the civilian employee health program enact by the congress last year . 
other factor increase operating_cost include the higher unit_cost of each flying hour , up 11  in two year , and of each steam hour , up 15  . 
in total , these increase in operating_cost outweigh the savings that result from declining program and from economy measure , such_as reduced number of unit and installation , smaller inventory of major equipment , and improvement in the supply and distribution system of the armed_forces . 
in the budget message for 1959 , and again for 1960 , i recommend immediate repeal of section 601 of the act of september 28 , 1951 ( 65 stat. 365 ) . 
this section prevent the military department and the office of civil and defense mobilization from carry_out certain transaction involve real_property unless they come into agreement with the group of the senate and the house_of_representatives . 
as i have state previously , the attorney_general has advise me that this section violate fundamental constitutional principle . 
accordingly , if it is not repeal by the congress at its present session , i shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the secretary of defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determine otherwise . 
basic long line communication in alaska are now provide through federal facility operate by the army , air_force , and group . 
the grow communication need of this new state can best be meet , as they have in other state , through the operation and development of such facility by private enterprise . 
legislation has already been propose to authorize the sale of these government owned system in alaska , and its early enactment be desirable . 
- approximately 45  of the expenditure for the department_of_defense be for procurement , research , development , and construction program . 
in 1961 , these expenditure are estimate at $ 18.9 billion , compare to $ 19.3 billion in 1960 . 
the decrease , which be largely in construction and in aircraft procurement , are offset in part by increase for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such_as tank , vehicle , gun , and electronic_device . 
expenditure for shipbuilding are estimate at about the same level as in 1960 . 
new obligational authority for 1961 recommend in this budget for aircraft procurement ( exclude amount for related research and construction ) total $ 4753 million , which be $ 1390 million below that enact for 1960 . 
on_the_other_hand , the new authority of $ 3825 million propose for missile procurement ( exclude research and construction ) in 1961 be $ 581 million high than for 1960 . 
these contrast trend in procurement reflect the anticipated change in the composition and mission of our armed_forces in the year ahead . 
the department_of_defense appropriation act for the past several year have contain a rider which limit competitive bid by firm in other country on certain military supply item . 
as i have repeatedly state , this provision be much more restrictive than the general law , popularly known_as the buy american act . 
i urge once_again that the congress not reenact this rider . 
the task of provide a reasonable level of military strength , without endanger other vital aspect of our security , is greatly complicate by the swift pace of scientific progress . 
the last few year have witness what have be perhaps the most rapid advance in military technology in history . 
some weapons_system have become obsolescent while still in production , and some while still under development . 
furthermore , unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological breakthrough on any one weapon_system , in itself , often diminish the relative importance of other competitive system . 
this has necessitate a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense_program in_order to redirect resource to the new and more important weapons_system and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons_system which have been overtake by event . 
thus , in the last few year , a number of program which look very promising at the time their development was commence have since been completely eliminate . 
for_example , the importance of the regulus_2 , , a very promising aerodynamic ship to surface missile design to be launch by surface submarine , was greatly diminish by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced polaris ballistic_missile launch by submerge submarine . 
another example be the recent cancellation of the f-108 , a long range interceptor with a speed three_times as great as the speed of sound , which was design for use against manned bomber in the period of the mid 1960 's . 
the substantial progress being make in ballistic_missile technology is rapidly shift the main threat from manned bomber to missile . 
considering the high cost of the f-108 system - over $ 4 billion for the force that had been plan - and the time_period in which it would become operational , it was decide to stop further work on the project . 
meanwhile , other air_defense force are being make effective , as describe later in this message . 
the size and scope of other important program have been reduce from early plan . 
notable in this category be the jupiter and thor intermediate range ballistic_missile , which have been successfully develop , produce , and deploy , but the relative importance of which has diminish with the increase availability of the atlas intercontinental_ballistic_missile . 
the impact of technological factor is also illustrate by the history of the high energy fuel program . 
this project was start at a time when there be a critical need for a high energy fuel to provide an extra margin of range for high performance aircraft , particularly our heavy bomber . 
continuing technical problem involve in the use of this fuel , couple with significant improvement in aircraft range through other means , have now raise serious question about the value of the high energy fuel program . 
as a result , the scope of this project has been sharply curtail . 
these example underscore the importance of even more searching evaluation of new major development program and even more penetrating and far ranging analysis of the potentiality of future technology . 
the cost of develop a major weapon_system be now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercise in select new system for development , in determine the most satisfactory rate of development , and in decide the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it . 
- the deterrent power of our armed_forces come from both their nuclear retaliatory capability and their capability to conduct other essential operation in any form of war . 
the first capability is represent by a combination of manned bomber , carrier based aircraft , and intercontinental and intermediate range missile . 
the second capability is represent by our deploy ground , naval , and air force in essential forward area , together with ready reserves capable of effect early emergency reinforcement . 
the group be the principal element of our long-range nuclear capability . 
one of the important and difficult decision which had to be made in this budget concern the role of the b-70 , a long range supersonic bomber . 
this aircraft , which was plan for initial operational use about 1965 , would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic_missile system , all_of which are schedule to become available earlier . 
the first atlas icbm 's be now operational , the first two polaris submarine are expect to be operational this calendar_year , and the first titan icbm 's next year . 
the minuteman solid fueled icbm is plan to be operational about mid 1963 . 
by 1965 , several or all_of these system will have been fully test and their reliability establish . 
thus , the need for the b-70 as a strategic weapon_system be doubtful . 
however , i am recommend that development work on the b-70 airframe and engine be continue . 
it is expect that in 1963 two prototype aircraft will be available for flight testing . 
by that time we should be in a much better position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon_system . 
i am recommend additional acquisition of the improved version of the b-52 ( the b-52_h with the new turbofan_engine ) and procurement of the b-58 supersonic medium bomber , together with the support refueling tanker in each case . 
these additional modern bomber will replace some of the old b-47 medium bomber ; one b-52 can do the work of several b-47 's which it will replace . 
funds are also include in this budget to continue the equipping of the b-52 wing with the hound_dog air-to-surface_missile . 
in the coming fiscal_year additional quantity of atlas , titan , and polaris missile also will be procure .

if a taxpayer die , the executor , administrator , or legal representative must file the final return for the decedent on or before the 15th day of the 4th month follow the close of the deceased taxpayer 's normal tax year . 
suppose person , who , for 1960 , file on the basis of a calendar_year , die june 20 , 1961 . 
his return for the period january 1 to june 20 , 1961 , be_due april 16 , 1962 . 
the return for a decedent may also serve as a claim for refund of an overpayment of tax . 
in such a case , form_1310 should be complete and attach to the return . 
this form may be obtain from the local office of your district director . 
return of estate or trust be_due on or before the 15th day of the 4th month after the close of the tax year . 
under unusual circumstance a resident individual may be grant an extension of time to file a return . 
you may apply for such an extension by file form_2688 , application_for_extension_of_time_to_file , with the person for your district , or you may make your application in a letter . 
your application must include the following information : 
( 1 ) your reason for request an extension , ( 2 ) whether you file timely income_tax_return for the 3 preceding year , and ( 3 ) whether you were require to file an estimated return for the year , and if so whether you did file and have pay the estimated tax payment on or before the due_date . 
any failure to file timely return or make estimated tax payment when due must be fully explain . 
extension are not grant as a matter_of_course , and the reason for your request must be substantial . 
if you be unable to sign the request , because of illness or other good cause , another person who stand in close personal or business_relationship to you may sign the request on your behalf , state the reason why you be unable to sign . 
you should make any request for an extension early so that if it is refuse , your return may still be on_time . 
see_also interest_on_unpaid_taxes , below . 
citizen of the united_states who , on april 15 , be not in the united_states or puerto_rico , are allow an extension of time until june 15 for file the return for the preceding calendar_year . 
an extension of 2 month beyond the regular due_date for file be also available to taxpayer make return for a fiscal_year . 
taxpayer reside or travel in alaska are also allow this extension of time for file , but those reside or travel in hawaii are not allow this automatic extension .

such interest must be pay even though an extension of time for file is grant . 
if your computation on form_1040 or form_1040_a show you owe additional tax , it should be remit with your return unless you owe less_than $ 1 , in which case it is forgive . 
if payment be by cash , you should ask for a receipt . 
if you file form_1040_a and the person compute your tax , you will be send a bill if additional tax be_due . 
this bill should be pay within 30 day . 
whether the check be certify or uncertified , the tax is not pay until the check is pay . 
if the check be not good and the april 15 or other due_date deadline elapse , addition to the tax may be incur . 
furthermore , a bad check may subject the maker to certain penalty . 
all check and money_order should be make payable to internal_revenue_service . 
an overpayment of income and social_security tax entitle you to a refund unless you indicate on the return that the overpayment should be apply to your succeeding year 's estimated tax .

the deduction allow in determine adjusted_gross_income put all taxpayer on a comparable basis . 
it be the amount you enter on line 9 , page 1 of form_1040 . 
some deduction are subtract from gross income to determine adjusted_gross_income . 
other deduction are subtract only from adjusted_gross_income in arrive at taxable_income . 
to compute your adjusted gross income you total all item of income . 
( see chapter 6 . ) 
from this amount deduct the item indicate below . 
businessman deduct all ordinary and necessary expense attributable to a trade or business . 
if you hold property for the production of rent or royalty you subtract , in compute adjusted_gross_income , ordinary and necessary expense and certain other deduction attributable to the property .

( see chapter 10 . ) 
employee deduct expense of travel , meal and lodge while away from home in_connection_with the performance of their services as employee . 
they also deduct transportation expense incur in_connection_with the performance of services as employee even though they be not away from home . 
( see chapter 12 . ) 
if your employer reimburse you for expense incur , you deduct such expense if they otherwise qualify . 
( see chapter 10 . ) 
sick_pay , if include in your gross income , is deduct in arrive at adjusted_gross_income . 
if your sick_pay is not include in your gross income , you may_not deduct it . 
( see chapter 9 . ) 
if you be a life_tenant , you deduct allowable depreciation and depletion . 
if you be an income beneficiary of property hold in trust or an heir , legatee , or devisee , you may deduct allowable depreciation and depletion , if not deductible by the estate or trust .

( see chapter 20 . ) 
you also deduct 50  of the excess of net long-term capital_gain over net short-term capital_loss in determine adjusted_gross_income . 
( see chapter 24 . ) 
certain other deduction are not allow in determine adjusted_gross_income . 
they may be claim only by itemize them on page 2 of form_1040 . 
these deduction may_not be claim if you elect to use the standard deduction or tax table . 
( see chapter 30 through 37 . ) 
a minor be subject to tax on his own earnings even though his parent may , under local law , have the right to them and might actually have receive the money . 
his income be not required to be include in the return of his parent . 
a minor child is allow a personal exemption of $ 600 on his own return regardless of how much money he may earn . 
if your child be under 19 or be a student you may also claim an exemption for him if he qualify as your dependent , even though he earn $ 600 or more . 
see chapter 5 . 
your 16 year old son earn $ 720 in 1961 . 
you spend $ 800 for his support . 
since he have gross income of $ 600 or more , he must file a return in which he may claim an exemption deduction of $ 600 . 
since you contribute more_than half of his support , you may also claim an exemption for him on your return . 
a minor who have gross income of less_than $ 600 be entitled to a refund if income_tax was withhold from his wage . 
generally , the refund may be obtain by file form_1040_a accompany by the withholding statement ( form_w-2 ) . 
if he have income other_than wage subject to withholding , he may be require to file form_1040 . 
see chapter 1 . 
if your child work for you , you may deduct reasonable wage you pay to him for services he render in your business . 
you may deduct these payment even though your child use the money to purchase his own clothing or other necessity which you be normally obligated to furnish him , and even though you may be entitled to his services . 
it would have been desirable for the two community to have differ only in respect to the variable being investigate : the degree of structure in teaching_method . 
the structured school be in an industrial city , with three family tenement_house typical of the residential area , but with one rather sizable section of middle-class home . 
the unstructured school be in a large suburban community , predominantly middle-class - to upper-middle-class , but fringed by an industrial area . 
in_order to equate the sample on socioeconomic status , we choose school in both city on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhood . 
school_principal and guidance worker make rating of the various neighborhood and the research team make independent observation of house and dwelling area . 
an objective scale was develop for rate school neighborhood from these data . 
equal proportion of child in each city were draw from upper-lower-class and lower-middle-class neighborhood . 
individual difference in maturation and the development of readiness for learn to read indicate that not until the third grade have most child have ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school achievement . 
therefore , third grade child were choose as subject for this study . 
for purpose of sample selection only ( individual test were give later ) we obtain group test score of reading achievement and intelligence from school record of the entire third grade population in each school_system . 
the subject for this study were randomly select from stratified area of the distribution , one-third as underachiever , one-third medium , and one-third overachiever . 
child whose reading score be at_least one standard_deviation below the regression_line of each total third grade school population were consider underachiever for the purpose of sample selection . 
overachiever be at_least one standard_deviation above the regression_line in their school_system . 
the final sample be not significantly different from a normal_distribution in regard_to reading achievement or intelligence_test score . 
twenty-four classroom in twelve unstructured school furnish 156 case , 87 boy and 69 girl . 
eight classroom in three structured school furnish 72 case , 36 boy and 36 girl . 
administrative restriction necessitate the smaller sample size in the structured school . 
it was assume that the sampling procedure be purely random with_respect_to the personality variable under investigation . 
an interview schedule of open-ended question and a multiple-choice questionnaire were prepare , and one parent of each of the sample child was see in the home . 
the parent was ask to describe the child 's typical behavior in certain standard situation in which there was an opportunity to observe tendency toward perfectionism in demand upon self and others , irrational conformity to rule , orderliness , punctuality , and need for certainty . 
the interviewer were instruct not to suggest answer and , as_much_as_possible , to record the parent ' actual words as they describe the child 's behavior in home situation . 
the rating scale of compulsivity was construct by first peruse the interview record , categorize all evidence related to compulsivity , then arrange a distribution of such information apart from the case record . 
final rating were make on the basis of a point_system which was develop after study the distribution of actual behavior record and assign weight value to each type of behavior that be deviant from the discovered norm . 
child score high in compulsivity be those who give evidence of tension or emotionality in situation where there was lack of organization or conformity to standard and expectation , or who make exaggerated effort to achieve these goal . 
the low compulsive child be one who appear relatively unconcerned about such matter . 
for_instance , the following statement was rate low in compulsivity , `` she be naturally quite neat about thing , but it does n't bother her at_all if her room get messy . 
but she clean_up it up very well when i remind her '' . 
person , et_al. revise the taylor_anxiety_scale for use with child . 
the taylor_scale was adapt from the minnesota_multiphastic_personality_inventory , with item selection base upon clinical definition of anxiety . 
there is much research evidence to validate the use of the instrument in differentiate individual who be likely to manifest anxiety in varying degree . 
reliability and validation work with the children 's anxiety_scale by person , et_al. demonstrate result closely similar to the finding with the adult scale . 
although the taylor_scale was design as a group testing device , in this study it was individually administer by psychologically trained worker who establish rapport and assist the child in read the item . 
the question may be raise whether or not we are deal with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity . 
the two rating yield a correlation of + .04 , which be not significantly different from zero ; therefore , we have measure two different characteristic . 
in_theory , compulsive behavior be a way of diminish anxiety , and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many child the obsessive-compulsive defense be not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer . 
the issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be take_up later . 
in the primary grade , reading permeate almost every aspect of school progress , and the child 's early experience of success or failure in learn to read often set a pattern of total achievement that be relatively enduring throughout the following year . 
in establish criterion measurement , it was therefore think best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself . 
the predicted interaction effect should , if potent , extend its influence over all academic achievement . 
the stanford_achievement_test , form_j , was administer by classroom teacher , consist_of a battery of six sub-test : paragraph meaning , word meaning , spelling , language , arithmetic computation , and arithmetic reasoning . 
all_of these sub-test involve reading except arithmetic computation . 
score are state in grade equivalent on a national norm . 
the battery median grade equivalent was use in data analysis in this study . 
the wechsler_intelligence_scale_for_children was administer to each sample third grade child by a clinical worker . 
the relationship of intelligence_test score to school achievement be a well established fact ( in this case , * * f ) ; therefore , in the investigation of the present hypothesis , it was necessary to control this factor . 
the criterion score use in the statistical analysis be an index of overachievement - or underachievement . 
it be the discrepancy between the actual attained achievement test score and the score that would be predict by the i.q. . 
for_example , on the basis of the regression_equation , a child with an i.q. of 120 in this sample would be expect to earn an achievement test score of 4.8 ( grade equivalent ) . 
if a child with an i.q. of 120 score 5.5 in achievement , his discrepancy score would be + .7 , represent .7 of one year of overachievement . 
a child with an i.q. of 98 would be expect to earn an achievement test score of 3.5 . 
if such a child score three , his discrepancy score would be - .5 , represent .5 of one year of underachievement . 
in this manner , the factor measure by the intelligence_test were control , allow discovered difference in achievement to be interpret as result from other variable . 
table 1 and 2 present the result of the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is use as the descriptive variable . 
figure 1 portray the mean achievement score of each subgroup graphically . 
first_of_all , as we had surmise , the highly compulsive child in the structured setting score significantly better ( * * f ) on achievement than do similar child in the unstructured school . 
it can be see too that when we contrast level of compulsivity within the structured school , the high compulsive child do better ( * * f ) . 
no significant difference was find in achievement between high and low compulsive child within the unstructured school . 
the hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching_method was support , in this case , at the .05 level . 
while we had expect that compulsive child in the unstructured school setting would have difficulty when compare to those in the structured , we were surprise to find that the achievement of the high compulsive within the school where the whole-word_method is use in beginning reading compare favorably with that of the low compulsive . 
indeed their achievement score be somewhat better on an absolute basis although the difference be not significant . 
we speculate that compulsive in the unstructured school be under greater strain because of the lack of systematization in their school setting , but that their need to organize ( for comfort ) be so intense that they struggle to induce the phonic rule and achieve in_spite_of the lack of direction from the environment . 
it is interesting to note that medium compulsive in the unstructured school make the low achievement score ( although not significantly low ) . 
possibly their compulsivity be not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure . 
our conjecture be , then , that regardless of the manner in which school lesson are teach , the compulsive child accentuate those element of each lesson that aid him in systematize his work . 
when help by a high degree of structure in lesson presentation , then , and only then , does such a child attain unusual success . 
the statistical analysis of achievement in_relation_to anxiety and teaching_method and the interaction of the two are present in table 3 and 4 . 
figure 2 be a graph of the mean achievement score of each group . 
as predict , the highly anxious child in the unstructured school score more poorly ( * * f ) than those in the structured school . 
the interaction effect , which be significant at the .01 level , can be see best in the contrast of mean score . 
while high anxiety child achieve significantly less well ( * * f ) in the unstructured school than do low anxiety child , they appear to do at_least as well as the average in the structured classroom . 
the most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrate be the marked decrement in performance suffer by the highly anxious child in unstructured school . 
according_to the theory propose , this be a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persist unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment . 
the fact that such threat be potent in the beginning reading lesson is think to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or underachievement these child exhibit . 
the child with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety released energy toward achievement , but because his distress severely reduce the ability of discrimination and memorization of complex symbol , the child may fail in his initial attempt to master the problem . 
failure confirm the threat , and the intensity of anxiety is increase as the required learning become more difficult , so that by the time the child reach the third grade the decrement in performance be pronounced . 
the individual with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered power of discrimination . 
but the symbol he is ask to learn be simple . 
as show earlier , the highly anxious individual may be superior in his memorize of simple element . 
success reduce the prospect of threat and his power of discrimination are improve . 
by the time the child first attack the actual problem of reading , he be completely familiar and at_ease with all_of the element of word . 
apparently academic challenge in the structured setting create an optimum of stress so_that the child with high anxiety be able to achieve because he be aroused to an energetic state without become confused or panicked . 
person et_al. present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test like situation , and that his performance will be impair unless he receive supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher . 
although the present study be not a direct replication of their investigation , the result do not confirm their conclusion . 
observer , in the two school_system study here , judge the teacher in the structured school to be more impersonal and demanding , while the atmosphere in the unstructured school was judge to be more supporting and accepting . 
yet the highly anxious child suffer a tremendous disadvantage only in the unstructured school , and perform as well or better than average in the structured setting . 
analysis mean the evaluation of subpart , the comparative rating of part , the comprehension of the meaning of isolated element . 
analysis in roleplaying is usually do for the purpose of understand strong_point and weak_point of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak_part and strengthen good_part . 
up to this point stress has been place on roleplaying in_terms_of individual . 
roleplaying can be do for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedure , regardless of individual . 
for_example : a sale presentation can be analyze and evaluate through roleplaying . 
let us now put some flesh_on_the_theoretical_bones we have assemble by give illustration of roleplaying use for evaluation and analysis . 
one should keep in mind that many_of the exciting possibility of roleplaying be largely unexplored and have not been use in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other area . 
the president of a small firm sell restaurant product , have considerable difficulty in find suitable salesman for his business . 
interview , check reference , train the salesman , have them go with more experienced salesman be expensive - and the rate_of_attrition due_to resignation or unsatisfactory performance be too high . 
it be his experience that only one good salesman was find out of every seven hire - and only one was hire out of every seven interview . 
roleplaying was offer as a solution - and the procedure work as_follows : all candidate were invite to a hotel conference_room , where the president explain the difficulty he have , and how unnecessary it seem to him to hire people who just did not work_out . 
in_place_of ask salesman to fill_out questionnaire , check their reference , interview them , ask them to be try_out , he tell them he would prefer to test them . 
each person was to enter the testing_room , carry a suitcase of sample . 
each salesman was to read a sheet contain a description of the product . 
in the testing_room he was to make , successively , three presentation to three different people . 
in the testing_room , three of the veteran salesman serve as antagonist . 
one handle the salesman in a friendly manner , another in a rough manner , and the third in a hesitating manner . 
each was tell to purchase material if he feel_like it . 
the antagonist come_in , one_at_a_time , and did not see or hear the other presentation . 
after each presentation , the antagonist write his judgment of the salesman ; and so did the observer consist_of the president , three of his salesman and a psychologist . 
ten salesman were test in the morning and ten more in the afternoon . 
this procedure was repeat one day a month for four month . 
the batting_average of one success out of seven increase to one out of three . 
the president of the firm , calculate expense alone , feel his cost had drop one-half while success in selection had improve over one_hundred percent . 
the reason for the value of this procedure be simply that the applicant were test `` at work '' in different situation by the judgment of a number of expert who could see how the salesman conduct themselves with different , but typical restaurant owner and manager . 
they were , in_a_sense , `` try_out '' in realistic situation . 
from the point_of_view of the applicant , less time was waste in being evaluate - and they get a meal out of it as_well_as some insight into their performance . 
another use of roleplaying for evaluation illustrate how this procedure can be use in real_life situation without special equipment or special assistant during the daily course of work . 
the position of receptionist was open in a large office and an announcement was made to the other girl already work that they could apply for this job which have high prestige and slightly high salary than typing and clerking position . 
all applicant be generally familiar_with the work of the receptionist . 
at the end of work one day , the personnel man take the applicant one_at_a_time , ask them to sit behind the receptionist 's desk and he then play the role of a number of people who might come to the receptionist with a number of query and for a number of purpose . 
each girl was independently `` test '' by the personnel man , and he serve not_only as the director , but as the antagonist and the observer . 
somewhat to his surprise he find that one girl , whom he would never have consider for the job since she had appear somewhat mousy and also had be in the office a relatively short time , do the most outstanding job of play the role of receptionist , show wit , sparkle , and aplomb . 
she was hire and was find to be entirely satisfactory when she play the role eight hours a day . 
in consider roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area , since we are now no_longer deal with a simple overall decision but rather with the examination and evaluation of many element see in dynamic functioning . 
some case in_evidence of the use of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the procedure . 
an engineer had been make the works manager of a firm , supplant a retired employee who had been consider outstandingly successful . 
the engineer have more_than seven year of experience in the firm , be well trained , was consider a hard_worker , was respect by his fellow engineer for his technical competence and was regard_as a `` comer '' . 
however , he turn_out to be a complete failure in his new position . 
he seem to antagonize everyone . 
turnover rate of personnel go_up , production drop , and morale was visibly reduce . 
despite the fact that he was regard_as an outstanding engineer , he seem to be a very poor administrator , although no one quite know what be wrong with him . 
at the insistence of his own supervisor - the president of the firm , he enrol in a course design to develop leader . 
he play a number of typical situation before observer , other supervisor who keep note and then explain to him in_detail what he do they think be wrong . 
entirely concerned with efficiency , he be merciless in criticize people who make mistake , condemn them to too great an extent . 
he did not really listen to others , have little interest in their idea , and want to have his own way - which be the only right way . 
the entire group of manager explain , in great detail , a number of human relations error that he make . 
one_by_one , these error were discuss and one_by_one he reject accept them as error . 
he admit his behavior , and defend it . 
he refuse to change his approach , and instead he attack high_and_low - the official for their not back him , and subordinate for their laxness , stupidity , and stubbornness . 
after the diagnosing , he leave the course , convince that it could do_good him no good . 
we may say that his problem was diagnose but that he refuse treatment . 
the engineer turn works manager have a particular view of life - and refuse to change it . 
we may say that his attitude be foolish , since he may have be a success had he learn some human relations skill ; or we may say that his attitude be commendable , show his independence of mind , in his refusal to adjust to the opinion of others . 
in_any_case , he refuse to accept the implication of the analysis , that he needed to be make_over . 
another case may be give in illustration of a successful use of analysis , and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive analysis . 
in a course for supermarket operator , a district_manager who had been recently appoint to his position after be outstandingly successful as a store manager , find that in supervise other manager he was have a difficult time . 
on play some typical situation before a jury of his peer he show some characteristic rate as unsatisfactory . 
he was tell he display , for_example , a sense of superiority - and he answer : `` well , i be supposed to know all the answer , are n't i '' ? 
he was criticize for his curtness and abruptness - and he answer : `` i am not work to become popular '' . 
on being criticize for his arbitrary behavior - he answer : `` i have to make decision . 
that be my job '' . 
in_short , as frequently happen in analysis , the individual feel threatened and defend himself . 
however , in this case the district_manager was lead to see the error of his way . 
the necessary step between diagnosis and training be acceptance of the validity of the criticism . 
how this was accomplish may be describe , since this sometimes be a crucial problem . 
the director help tailor-make a checklist of the district_manager 's error by ask various observer to write_out sentence comment on the mistake they feel he make . 
these error were then collect and write on a blackboard , condense similar idea . 
eighteen error were locate , and then the director ask each individual to vote whether or not they feel that this manager had make the particular error . 
they were ask to vote `` true '' if they think they had see him make the error , `` false '' if they think he had not ; and `` cannot say '' if they be not certain . 
the manager sit behind the group so he could see and count the hand that go_up , and the director write the number on the blackboard . 
no comment were made during the voting . 
the result look as_follows : 
* * f . 
the first eight of these eighteen statement , which receive at_least one-half of the vote , were duplicate to form an analysis checklist for the particular manager , and when this particular manager roleplay in other situation , the member check any item that appear . 
to prevent the manager from deliberately control himself only during the session , they be rather lengthy ( about twenty minute ) , the situation were imperfectly describe to the manager so that he would not know what to expect , new antagonist were bring on the scene unexpectedly , and the antagonist were instruct to deliberately behave in such way as to upset the manager and get him to operate in a manner for which he had been previously criticize . 
after every session , the check_mark were total up and graph , and in this way the supervisor 's progress was chart . 
in life we learn to play our role and we `` freeze '' into pattern which become so habitual that we be not really aware of what we do . 
we can see others more clearly than we can see ourselves , and others can see us better than we see ourselves . 
to learn what we do be the first_step for improvement . 
to accept the validity of the judgment of others be the second step . 
to want to change be the third step . 
to practice new procedure under guided supervision and with constant feedback be the fourth step . 
to use these new way in daily life be the last step . 
roleplaying used for analysis follow these general step lead to training . 
when an evaluative situation is set_up , and no concern be with the detail that lead to an overall estimate , we say that roleplaying is use for evaluation . 
observer can see a person engage in spontaneous behavior , and watch him operate in a totalistic fashion . 
this behavior be more `` veridical '' - or true than other testing behavior for some type of evaluation , and so can give quick and accurate estimate of complex functioning . 
while roleplaying for testing is not too well understand at the present time , it represent one of the major use of this procedure . 
the objective of this chapter be to clarify the distinction between spontaneity theory and other training concept . 
in_addition , the basic approach utilize in apply roleplaying will be review . 
the goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated rationale to aid him in apply roleplaying technique in this unique training area . 
the reason for extract this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of training be twofold : 
spontaneity training theory be unique and relatively new . 
it is not easy for the therapist to discern when , in the patient 's communicating , an introject has appear and is hold_sway . 
one learn to become alert to change in his vocal tone - to his voice 's suddenly shift to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sound somehow artificial or , in some instance , parrotlike . 
the content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition , as if a phonograph_needle were stick in one groove ; only seldom be it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parrot some timeworn axiom , common to our culture , which he has evidently hear , over_and_over , from a parent until he experience it as part of him . 
one hebephrenic woman often become submerge in what feel to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo emotion , during which , despite her wracking sob and streaming cheek , i feel only a cold annoyance with her . 
eventually such incident become more sporadic , and more sharply demarcate from her day-after-day behavior , and in one particular session , after several minute of such behavior - which , as_usual , go_on without any accompanying words from her - she ask , eagerly , `` did you see person '' ? 
at_first i did not know what she mean ; i think she must be see me as some one who had just come from see her grandmother , in their distant home city . 
then i realize that she had been deliberately show me , this time , what person be like ; and when i reply in this spirit , she corroborate my hunch . 
at another phase in the therapy , when a pathogenic mother introject begin to emerge more_and_more upon the investigative scene , she mutter in a low but intense voice , to herself , `` i hate that woman inside me '' ! 
i could evoke no further elaboration from her about this ; but a_few second later she was stand directly across the room from me , look me in the eye and say in a scathingly condemnatory tone , `` your father despise you '' ! 
again , i at_first misconstrue this disconcertingly intense communication , and i quickly cast_around through my mind to account_for her be able to speak , with such utter conviction , of an opinion hold by my father , now several year deceased . 
then i reply , coldly , `` if you despise me , why do n't you say so , directly '' ? 
she look confused at this , and i feel sure it had be a wrong response for me to make . 
it then occur to me to ask , `` is that what that woman tell you '' ? 
she clearly agree that this had be the case . 
i realize , now , that she had been show me , in what impress me as be a very accurate way , something her mother had once say to her ; it be as if she was show me one of the reason why she hate that woman inside her . 
what had be an unmanageably powerful introject be now , despite its continuing charge of energy disconcerting to me , sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother be like . 
earlier , this woman had be so filled with a chaotic variety of introject that at_times , when she be in her room alone , it would sound to a passerby as though there be several different person in the room , as she would vocalize in various kind of voice . 
a somewhat less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine , who used_to often seclude herself in her room , often sound through the closed door - as i would find on pass_by , between our session - for_all_the_world like two person , a scolding mother and a defensive child . 
particularly hard for the therapist to grasp be those instance in_which the patient is manifest an introject traceable to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter be himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he find distinctly unwelcome . 
i have find , time_and_again , that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rest , in_the_final_analysis , on this basis ; and only when i can acknowledge this , to myself , as be indeed an aspect of my personality , does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient 's behavior . 
for_example , one hebephrenic man used_to annoy me , month after month , by say , whenever i get_up to leave and made my fairly stereotyped comment that i would be see him on the following day , or whenever , `` you 're welcome '' , in a notably condescending fashion - as though it be his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spend the hour with him , and he were thus point_up my failure to utter a humbly grateful , `` thank_you '' to him at the end of each session . 
eventually it become clear to me , partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point_out my condescension to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his condescending , `` you 're welcome '' , was very accurately personify an element of obnoxious condescension which had be present in my own demeanor , over these month , on each of these occasion when i had bid him good-bye with the consoling note , each time , that the healing christ would be stoop_to dispense this succor to the poor suffered again on the morrow . 
another patient , a paranoid woman , for many month infuriate not_only me but the ward personnel and her fellow patient by arrogantly behave as though she own the whole building , as though she be the only person in it whose need be to be meet . 
this behavior on her part subside only after i had come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between , on_the_one_hand , her arrange the ventilation of the common living_room to her own liking , or turn_off the television off or on without regard_to the wish of the others , and on_the_other_hand , my own come stolidly into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objection , bring my big easy_chair with me , usually shut the window of her room which she prefer to keep in a very cold state , and plunk myself down in my chair - in_short , behave as if i own her room . 
here a variety of meaning and emotion are concentrate , or reduce , in their communicative expression , to some comparatively simple seeming verbal or nonverbal statement . 
one find , for_example , that a terse and stereotyped verbal expression , seem at_first to be a mere hollow convention , reveal itself over the month of therapy as the vehicle for express the most varied and intense feeling , and the most unconventional of meaning . 
more_than anything , it be the therapist 's intuitive sensing of these latent meaning in the stereotype which help these meaning to become reveal , something like a spread-out deck_of_cards , on sporadic occasion over the passage of the patient 's and his month of work together . 
one cannot assume , of_course , that all these accumulated meaning be inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy , or at any one time later_on when the stereotype was utter ; probably it be correct to think_of it as a matter of a well grooved , stereotyped mode of expression - and no , or but a_few , other communicational groove , as_yet - be there , available for the patient 's use , as newly emerging emotion and idea well_up in him over the course of month . 
but it be true that the therapist can sense , when he hear this stereotype , that there be at this moment many emotional determinant at_work in it , a blurred babel of indistinct voice which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another . 
sometimes it be not a verbal stereotype - a `` how be you now '' ? or an `` i want to go_home '' , or whatever - but a nonverbal one which reveal itself , gradually , as the condensed expression of more than one latent meaning . 
a hebephrenic man used_to give a repetitious wave of his hand a number of time during his largely silent hour with his therapist . 
when the therapist come to feel on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him , `` what be that , person - hello or farewell '' ? 
, the patient reply , `` both , person - two in one '' . 
of all the possible form of nonverbal expression , that which seem best to give release , and communicational expression , to complex and undifferentiated feeling be laughter . 
it be no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient , the most severely dedifferentiated of all schizophrenic patient , show , as one of his characteristic symptom , laughter - laughter which now make one feel scorn or hate , which now make one feel_like weep , or which now give one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man 's despair ; and which , more often than all these , convey a welter of feeling which could in_no_way be convey by any number of words , words which be so unlike this welter in be formed and discrete from one another . 
to a much less full extent , the hebephrenic person 's belching or flatus have a comparable communicative function ; in work with these patient the therapist eventually gets to do some at_least private mull over of the possible meaning of a belch , or the passage of flatus , not_only because he be reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze , but also because he learn that even these animal like sound constitute form of communication in which , from_time_to_time , quite different thing are being say , long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these , as distinct feeling and concept , to say them in words . 
as i have been intimate , in the schizophrenic - and perhaps also in the dream of the neurotic ; this be a question which i have no wish to take_up - condensation be a phenomenon in which one find not a condensed expression of various feeling and idea which be , at an unconscious level , well sort_out , but rather a condensed expression of feeling and idea which , even in the unconscious , have yet to become well differentiated from one another . 
person , person and person , in their description of the disturbance of thinking find in chronic schizophrenic patient , say , in regard_to condensation , that `` the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment , and the object contain therein in itself be the prototypical condensation '' . 
in my experience , a great many_of the patient 's more puzzling verbal communication be so for the reason that concrete meaning have not become differentiate from figurative meaning in his subjective experience . 
thus he may be refer to some concrete thing , or incident , in his immediate environment by some symbolic sounding , hyperbolic reference to transcendental event on the global scene . 
recently , for_example , a paranoid woman 's large-scale philosophizing , in the session , about the intrusive curiosity which has become , in her opinion , a deplorable characteristic of mid twentieth century human culture , develop_into itself , before the end of the session , into a suspicion that i was surreptitiously peek at her partially exposed breast , as indeed i was . 
or , equally often , a concretistic seeming , particularistic seeming statement may consist , with its mundane exterior , in a form of poetry - may be full of meaning and emotion when interpret as a figurative expression : a metaphor , a simile , an allegory , or some other symbolic mode of speaking . 
of such hidden meaning the patient himself be , more_often_than_not , entirely unaware . 
his subjective experience may be a remarkably concretistic one . 
one hebephrenic woman confide to me , `` i live in a world of word '' , as if , to her , word be fully concrete object ; person , in his excellent article ( 1955 ) concern schizophrenic communication , include mention of similar clinical material . 
a borderline schizophrenic young man tell me that to him the various theoretical concept about which he had been expound , in a most articulate fashion , during session after session with me , be like great cube of almost tangibly solid matter up in the air above him ; as he speak i was remind of the great bale of cargo which are swing , high in the air , from a docked steamship . 
the many linguistic technique for reduce the amount of dictionary information that have been propose all organize the dictionary 's content around prefix , stem , suffix , etc. . 
a significant reduction in the volume of store information is thus realize , especially for a highly inflected language such_as russian . 
for english the reduction in size be less striking . 
this approach require that : ( 1 ) each text word be separate into smaller element to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary_entry , and ( 2 ) the information retrieve from several entry in the dictionary be synthesize into a description of the particular word . 
the logical scheme use to accomplish the former influence the placement of information in the dictionary file . 
implementation of the latter require storage of information need only for synthesis . 
we suggest the application of certain data_processing technique as a solution to the problem . 
but first , we must define two term so that their meaning will be clearly understand : 
form - any unique sequence of alphabetic_character that can appear in a language precede and follow by a space . 
occurrence - an instance of a form in text . 
we propose a method for select only dictionary information require by the text being translate and a means for pass the information directly to the occurrence in text . 
we accomplish this by compile a list of text form as text is read by the computer . 
a ram storage scheme , base on the spelling of form , provide an economical way to compile this text form list . 
dictionary form find to match form in the text list are mark . 
a location in the computer store is also name for each marked form ; dictionary information about the form store at this location can be retrieve directly by occurrence of the form in text . 
finally , information is retrieve from the dictionary as_required by stage of the translation process - the grammatic description for sentence_structure determination , equivalent choice information for semantic analysis , and target_language equivalent for output construction . 
the dictionary be a form dictionary , at_least in the sense that complete form are use as the basis for match text occurrence with dictionary_entry . 
also , the dictionary is divide into at_least two part : 
the list of dictionary form and the file of information that pertain to these form . 
a more detailed description of dictionary operation - text lookup and dictionary modification - give a clear picture . 
text lookup , as we will describe it , consist_of three step . 
the first be compiling a list of text form , assigning an information cell to each , and replacing text occurrence with the information cell assign to the form of each occurrence . 
for this step the computer memory is separate into three region : cell in the w_region are use for storage of the form in the text form list ; cell in the x-region and y_region are reserve as information cell for text form . 
when an occurrence * * f is isolate during text reading , a random_memory address * * f , the address of a cell in the x-region , is compute from the form of * * f . 
let * * f denote the form of * * f . 
if cell * * f has not previously been assign as the information cell of a form in the text form list , it is now assign as the information cell of * * f . 
the form itself is store in the next available cell of the w-region , begin in cell * * f . 
the address * * f and the number of cell require to store the form are write in * * f ; the information cell * * f is save to represent the text occurrence . 
text reading continue with the next occurrence . 
let us assume that * * f be identical to the form of an occurrence * * f which precede * * f in the text . 
when this situation exist , the address * * f will equal * * f which was produce from * * f . 
if * * f was assign as the information cell for * * f , the routine can detect that * * f be identical to * * f by compare * * f with the form store at location * * f . 
the address * * f is store in the cell * * f . 
when , as in_this case , the two form match , the address * * f is save to represent the occurrence * * f . 
text reading continue with the next occurrence . 
a third situation be possible . 
the formula for compute random-access_memory address from the form of each occurrence will not give a distinct address for each distinct form . 
thus , when more_than one distinct form lead to a particular cell in the x-region , a chain of information cell must be create to accommodate the form , one cell in the chain for each form . 
if * * f lead to an address * * f that be equal to the address compute from * * f , even though * * f does not match * * f , the chain of information cell is extend from * * f by store the address of the next available cell in the y-region , * * f , in * * f . 
the cell * * f become the second information cell in the chain and is assign as the information cell of * * f . 
a third cell can be add by store the address of another y-cell in * * f ; similarly , as many cell are add as are require . 
each information cell in the chain contain the address of the y-cell where the form to which it is assign is store . 
each cell except the last in the chain also contain the address of the y-cell that be the next element of the chain ; the absence of such a link in the last cell indicate the end of the chain . 
hence , when the address * * f is compute from * * f , the cell * * f and all y-cells in its chain must be inspect to determine whether * * f be already in the form list or whether it should be add to the form list and the chain . 
when the information cell for * * f has been determine , it is save as a representation of * * f . 
text reading continue with the next occurrence . 
text reading is terminate when a predetermined number of form have been store in the text form list . 
this initiate the second step of glossary lookup - connect the information cell of form in the text form list to dictionary form . 
each form represent by the dictionary is look_up in the text form list . 
each time a dictionary form match a text form , the information cell of the matching text form is save . 
the number of dictionary form skip since the last one match is also save . 
these two piece of information for each dictionary form that is match by a text form constitute the table of dictionary usage . 
if each text form is mark when match with a dictionary form , the text form not contain in the dictionary can be identify when all dictionary form have been read . 
the appropriate action for handle these form can be take at that time . 
each dictionary form is look_up in the text form list by the same method use to look_up a new text occurrence in the form list during text reading . 
a random address * * f that lie within the x-region of memory mention earlier is compute from the i-th dictionary form . 
if cell * * f be an information cell , it and any information cell in the y-region that have been link to * * f each contain an address in the w-region where a potentially matching form is store . 
the dictionary form is compare with each of these text form . 
when a match is find , an entry is make in the table of dictionary usage . 
if cell * * f be not an information cell we conclude that the i-th dictionary form be not in the text list . 
these two step essentially complete the lookup operation . 
the final step merely use the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that pertain to each form match in the text form list , and use the list of information cell record in text order to attach the appropriate information to each occurrence in text . 
the list of text form in the w-region of memory and the content of the information cell in the x and y-regions are no_longer require . 
only the assignment of the information cell be important . 
the first stage of translation after glossary lookup be structural analysis of the input text . 
the grammatical description of each occurrence in the text must be retrieve from the dictionary to permit such an analysis . 
a description of this process will serve to illustrate how any type of information can be retrieve from the dictionary and attach to each text occurrence . 
the grammatic description of all form in the dictionary are record in a separate part of the dictionary file . 
the order be identical to the ordering of the form they describe . 
when entry are being retrieve from this file , the table of dictionary usage indicate which entry to skip and which entry to store in the computer . 
this selection rejection process take_place as the file is read . 
each entry that is select for storage is write into the next available cell of the w-region . 
the address of the first cell and the number of cell use is write in the information cell for the form . 
( the address of the information cell is also supply by the table of dictionary usage . ) 
when the complete file has been read , the grammatic description for all text form find in the dictionary have been store in the w-region ; the information cell assign to each text form contain the address of the grammatic description of the form it represent . 
hence , the description of each text occurrence can be retrieve by read the list of text ordered information cell address and output the description indicate by the information cell for each occurrence . 
the only requirement on dictionary information make by the text lookup operation be that each form represent by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the form . 
this leave the ordering of entry variable . 
( here an entry be a form plus the information that pertain to it . ) 
two very useful way for modify a form dictionary be the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigm rather than single form and the application of a single change to more_than one dictionary form . 
the former is intend to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage . 
the latter be useful for modify information about some or all form of a word , hence reduce the work require to improve dictionary content . 
apply the technique develop at harvard for generate a paradigm from a representative form and its classification , we can add all form of a word to the dictionary at_once . 
an extension of the principle would permit enter a grammatic description of each form . 
equivalent could be assign to the paradigm either at the time it is add to the dictionary or after the word has been study in context . 
thus , one can think_of a dictionary_entry as a word rather than a form . 
if all form of a paradigm are group together within the dictionary , a considerable reduction in the amount of information require be possible . 
for_example , the inflected form of a word can be represent , insofar as regular inflection allow , by a stem and a set of ending to be attach . 
( indeed , the set of ending can be replace by the name of a set of ending . ) 
the full form can be derive from such information just prior to the lookup of the form in the text form list . 
similarly , if the equivalent for the form of a word do not vary , the equivalent need be enter only once with an indication that they apply to each form . 
the dictionary system be in_no_way dependent upon such summarization or design around it . 
when irregularity and variation prevent summarize , information is write in complete detail . 
entry are summarize only_when by do so the amount of information retain in the dictionary is reduce and the time require for dictionary operation is decrease . 
in sentence , pattern of stress are determine by complex combination of influence that can only be suggest here . 
the tendency be toward put dominant stress at the end . 
there is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long known hymn tune . 
thus the first line of one of person 's hymn be as_follows . 
`` a charge to keep i have , a god to glorify '' . 
in the tune to which this hymn be most often sing , `` boylston '' , the syllable have and fy , end their line , have twice the time any other syllable have . 
dominant stress be of_course more than extended duration , and normally center_on syllable that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the word or long unit they be part of be speak alone : a dominant stress give to glorify would normally center_on its first syllable rather than its last . 
but the parallel be significant . 
when the answer to what be wrong now ? 
be person 's break a chair , dominant stress will usually be on the complement a chair . 
from the point_of_view of syntactic analysis the head word in the statement be the predicator has break , and from the point_of_view of meaning it would seem that the trouble center in the breaking ; but dominant stress will be assign to break only in rather exceptional version of the sentence . 
in i know one thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing ; in one thing i know it will usually be on the predicator know . 
in small_town people be very friendly dominant stress will generally be on the complement very friendly ; in the double sentence the small the town , the friendly the people it will generally be on the subject the town and the people . 
in what be a linguist ? 
dominant stress will generally be on the subject a linguist ; in who be a linguist ? 
it will generally be on the complement a linguist . 
dominant stress be on her luggage both in that be her luggage , where her luggage be the complement , and in there be her luggage , where it be the subject . 
adverbial second complement , however , be likely not to have dominant stress when they terminate sentence . 
if the answer to what was that noise ? 
be person put the cat out , dominant stress will ordinarily be on the first complement , the cat , not the second complement out . 
final adjunct may or may not have dominant stress . 
if the answer to what be that noise ? 
be person read the news emotionally , dominant stress may or may not be on the adjunct emotionally . 
when prepositional complement are divide as in what are you look_for ? 
they be likely to lose dominant stress . 
context be of extreme importance . 
what be new in the context be likely to be make more prominent than what be not . 
thus in a context in which there has be discussion of snow but mention of local condition be new , dominant stress will probably be on here in it rarely snow here , but in a context in which there has be discussion of local weather but no mention of snow , dominant stress will probably be on snow . 
the personal_pronoun and substitute one be normally unstressed because they refer to what be prominent in the immediate context . 
in i 'll go_with person dominant stress be probably on person ; but if person has just been mention prominently ( and the trip to be make has be under discussion ) , what is say be probably i 'll go_with him , and dominant stress be probably on the preposition with . 
when a gesture accompany who 's he ? 
the personal_pronoun have dominant stress because `` he '' has not been mention previously . 
if both person and a piece of information person does not have be prominent in the context , but the idea of tell person be new , then dominant stress will probably be on tell in why not tell person ? 
but when what be new in a particular context be also fairly obvious , there be normally only light stress or no stress at_all . 
thus the unstressed it of it rarely snow here get its significance from its use with snow : nothing can snow snow but `` it '' . 
in there are n't many young people in the neighborhood the modifier young take_away dominant stress away from its head people : the fact that the young creature of interest be people seem rather obvious . 
if woman replace people , it would normally have dominant stress . 
in i have thing to do the word thing make little real contribution to meaning and have weak stress than do . 
if work be substitute for thing ( with more exact contribution to meaning ) , it will have dominant stress . 
in i know one thing dominant stress be likely to go to one rather than to semantically pale thing . 
in i know you when you be a child , and you be pretty then dominant stress on then imply that the young_woman speak_to be still pretty . 
dominant stress on pretty would be almost insulting here . 
in the written_language then can be underline or italicize to guide the reader here , but much of the time the written_language simply depend_on the reader 's alertness , and a careless reader will have to back_up and reread . 
often dominant stress simply indicate a centering of attention or emotion . 
thus in it be incredible what that boy can eat dominant stress be likely to be on incredible , and eat will have strong stress also . 
in she has_it_in_for person dominant stress will ordinarily be on in , where the notion of stored_up antipathy seem to center . 
in we 're paint at our garage strong stress on at indicate that the job being do be not real painting but simply an effort at painting . 
where there be comparison or contrast dominant stress normally operate to center attention . 
thus in his friend be strange than his sister ' strong stress be normal for his and sister ' , but in his friend be strange than his sister strong stress be normal for friend and sister . 
in he 's hurt himself more_than he 's hurt you both himself and you have strong stress than they would ordinarily have if there be no contrast . 
in be she chinese or japanese ? 
the desire to contrast the first part of word which be alike in their last component produce an exceptional disregard of the normal pattern of stress of chinese and japanese . 
sometimes strong stress serve to focus an important secondary relationship . 
thus in person write an account of the trip first strong stress on person mark person as the first in a series of people who write account of the trip , strong stress on write mark the writing as the first of a series of action of person 's concern with an account of her trip ( about which she may later have make speech , for_example ) , and strong stress on trip make the trip the first of a series of subject about which person write account . 
in hunger stimulate man too the situation be very similar . 
strong stress on hunger treat hunger as an additional stimulus , strong stress on stimulate treat stimulation as an additional effect of hunger , strong stress on man treat man as an additional creature who respond to the stimulation of hunger . 
here again , in the written_language it be possible to help the reader get his stress right by use underline or italic , but much of the time there is simply reliance on his understanding in the light of context . 
when a word represent a larger construction of which it be the only expressed part , it normally have more stress than it would have in fully express construction . 
thus when yes , i have be the response to have you finish read the paper ? 
the stress on have , which here represent have finish read the paper , be quite strong . 
in person be the leader at camp , but person be here the be of the second main declarative represent be the leader and therefore have stress . 
person be the leader at camp , but person be here , with this be deprived_of stress , make here the complement in the clause . 
in of all the suggestion that were make , his be the silly the possessive his represent his suggestion and be stress . 
when go represent itself and a complement ( be equivalent_to , say , to go_to location ) in which boat did person go on ? 
it have strong stress ; when it represent only itself and on which be its complement ( so that go on be semantically equivalent_to board ) , on have strong stress than go does . 
omission of a subordinator pronoun , however , does not result in an increase in stress on a prepositional adverb for which the subordinator pronoun would be object . 
thus to have light stress both in that be the conclusion that i come to and in that be the conclusion i come to . 
but when to represent to consciousness in that be the moment that i come_to , and similarly in that be the moment i come_to , there be much strong stress on to . 
in i want to tell him , but i be afraid to the final to be lightly stress because it represent to tell him . 
in to tell him , of_course , to be normally unstressed . 
when i have instruction to leave be equivalent in meaning to i have instruction that i am to leave this place , dominant stress be ordinarily on leave . 
when the same sequence be equivalent in meaning to i have instruction which i am to leave , dominant stress be ordinarily on instruction . 
it is clear that pattern of stress sometimes show construction unambiguously in the spoken_language where without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the written . 
other example follow . 
`` i 'll come by tuesday . 
i can n't be happy long without drinking water '' . 
in the first of these sentence if by be the complement of come and tuesday be an adjunct of time equivalent_to on tuesday , there will be strong stress on by in the spoken_language ; but if a complement for come is imply and by tuesday be a prepositional unit use as an adjunct , by will be unstressed or lightly stress at_most . 
in the second sentence if drink water be a gerundial clause and without drinking water be roughly equivalent_to in meaning to unless i drink water , there will be strong stress on water than on drink ; but if drinking be a gerundial noun modify water and without drinking_water be equivalent_to without water for drinking , there will be strong stress on drinking than on water . 
but the use of stress in comparison and contrast , for_example , can undermine distinction such_as these . 
and pattern of stress be not always unambiguous by_any_means . 
in the person have busy life without visit relative only context can indicate whether visit relative be equivalent in meaning to paying visit to relative or to relative who are visit them , and in i look_up the number and i look up the chimney only the meaning of number and chimney make it clear that up be syntactically a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition follow by its object in the second . 
- syllable be linguistic_unit center in peak which be usually vocalic but , as has been note , be consonantal under certain circumstance , and which may or may not be combine with preceding and / or following consonant or combination of consonant . 
syllable be genuine unit , but division of word and sentence into them present great difficulty . 
sometimes even the number of syllable be not clear . 
doubt on this point be strong before / l / and / / or / r / . 
from the point_of_view of word formation real might be expect to have two syllable . 
historically re be the formative that is employ also in republic , and al be the common suffix . 
when ity is add , real clearly have two syllable . 
but there is every reason to regard deal as a monosyllable , and because of the fact that / l / commonly have the quality of / / when it follow vowel_sound , deal seem to be a perfectly satisfactory rhyme with real . 
it be obvious enough that linguist in_general have be less successful in cope_with tone_system than with consonant or vowel . 
no single explanation be adequate_to account_for this . 
improvement , however , be urgent , and at_least three thing will be needed . 
the first be a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analysis . 
even beginning student in linguistics are make familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant_system , both in their general outline and in many specific detail . 
an advanced student has read a considerable number of description of consonantal_system , include some of the more unusual type . 
by contrast , even experienced linguist commonly know no_more of the range of possibility in tone_system than the oversimplified distinction between register_language and contour_language . 
this limited familiarity with the possible phenomenon has severely hamper work with tone . 
tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory until a more representative selection of system be familiar to every practicing field linguist . 
papers like these four , if widely read , will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work . 
the second need be better field technique . 
the great majority of present-day linguist fall_into one or more of a number of overlapping type : those who be convinced that tone cannot be analyse , those who be personally scared of tone and tone_language generally , those who be convinced that tone be merely an unnecessary marginal feature in those language where it occur , those who have no idea how to proceed with tone analysis , those who take a simplistic view of the whole matter . 
the result has be neglect , fumbling effort , or superficial treatment . 
as these malady overlap , so must the cure . 
analysis such_as these four will simultaneously combat the assumption that tone be impossible and that it be simple . 
they will give suggestion that can be work_up into field procedure . 
good field technique will not_only equip linguist for better work , but also help them overcome negative attitude . 
actually , none of these papers say much directly about field technique . 
but it be worth ponder that very little has been publish on any phase of field technique in linguistics . 
these thing have been disseminate by other means , but always in the wake of extensive publication of analytic result . 
the third need be for better theory . 
we should expect that general phonologic theory should be as adequate for tone as for consonant and vowel , but it has not be . 
this can only be for one of two reason : either the two be quite different and will require totally different theory ( and hence technique ) , or our existing theory be insufficiently general . 
if , as i suspect , the problem be largely of the second sort , then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystem . 
one issue that must be face be the relative difficulty of analysis of different phonologic subsystem . 
since tone_system typically comprise fewer unit than either consonant_system or vowel_system , we might expect that they would be the easy part of a phonologic analysis . 
actual practice does not often work_out this way . 
tone_system be certainly more complex than the number of unit would suggest , and often analytically more difficult than much larger consonantal_system . 
person has suggest one explanation . 
tone_language use for linguistic contrast speech parameter which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use . 
this may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion for the more knowledgeable . 
the problem be to disentangle the linguistic feature of pitch from the cooccurring nonlinguistic feature . 
of_course , something of the same sort occur with other sector of the phonology : consonantal articulation have both a linguistic and an individual component . 
but in_general the individual variation be a small thing add onto basic linguistic feature of greater magnitude . 
with tone , individual difference may be greater than the linguistic contrast which are superimpose on them . 
pitch difference from one speaker to another , or from one emotional_state to another , may far exceed the small difference between tone . 
however , any such suggestion account_for only some of the difficulty in hear tone , or in develop a realistic attitude about tone , but not for the analytic difficulty that occur even when tone is meticulously record . 
a second explanation is suggest by the material describe in person ' paper . 
tone and intonation often become seriously intermeshed . 
neither can be adequately systematize until we be able to separate the two and assign the observed phenomenon individually to one or the other . 
other pair of phonologic subsystem also interact or overlap in this way ; for_example , duration sometimes figure in both the vowel_system and the intonation . 
some phonetic feature , for_example glottal_catch or murmur , are sometimes to be assign to segmental phonemics and sometimes to accentual_system . 
but no other two phonologic_system be as difficult to disentangle as are tone and intonation in some language . 
this explanation of tone difficulty , however , does not apply in all language . 
in some ( the ewe type mention above ) interaction of tone and intonation be restricted to the end of intonation span . 
in many of the syllable , intonation can be safely ignore , and much of the tonal analysis can be do without any study of intonation . 
still , even in such language tone analysis has not be as simple as one might expect . 
a third explanation is suggest by person 's analysis of sukuma tone . 
there we see a basically simple phonemic_system enmesh in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic_system . 
while the phoneme can be very easily state , no one be likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrence can be relate in_some_way to morphemic unit , i.e. until the morphophonemics is work_out , or at_least far enough that it seem reasonable to expect success . 
in the `` typical tone_language '' , tonal morphophonemics be of the same order of complexity as consonantal morphophonemics . 
the phonemic_system which must support these morphophonemic_system , however , be very different . 
the inventory of tone be much smaller , and commonly the contrast range along one single dimension , pitch level . 
consonantal_system be not merely larger , they be multidimensional . 
morphophonemic rule may be think_of as join certain point in the system . 
the possibility in the consonantal_system be very numerous , and only a small portion of them are actually use . 
phoneme connected by a morphophonemic rule commonly show a good bit of phonetic similarity , possible because of the several dimension of contrast in the system . 
tonal morphophonemics , in a common case , can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone . 
the possibility be few , and the total number of rule may be considerably greater . 
often , therefore , there be a number of rule have the same effect , and commonly other set of rule as_well , have the opposite effect . 
tonal morphophonemics be much more confusing to the beginning analyst than consonantal morphophonemics , even when the total number of rule be no greater . 
the difficulty of analysis of any subsystem in the phonology be an inverse_function of the size - smaller system be more troublesome - for any given degree of morphophonemic complexity . 
this hypothesis will account_for a large part of the difficulty of tonal analysis , as well as the fact that vowel_system be often more puzzling than consonantal_system . 
the statement of the system be a different matter . 
smaller system can of_course be state much more succinctly . 
a phonemic_system can be state without reference_to morphophonemics , but it cannot always be find without morphophonemics . 
and the more complex the morphophonemic_system be in_relation_to the phonemic base , the less easily a phonemic_system will be analyse without close attention to the morphophonemics - at_least , the less satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be relate through morphophonemic rule to grammatically meaningful structure . 
the design of orthography has receive much less attention from linguist than the problem deserve . 
there has be a tendency on the part of many american linguist to assume that a phonemic transcription will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only real problem will then be the social one of secure acceptance . 
this seem naive . 
most others have be content to give only the most general attention to the broad and most obvious feature of the phonology when design orthography . 
apparently the feeling be that anything more would be involvement in technical abstruseness of possible pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affair . 
the result of this attitude has be the domination of many orthography conference by such consideration as typographic ' esthetic ' , which usually turn_out to be nothing more than certain prejudice carry_over from european language . 
many_of the suggested system seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structure that they purport to represent . 
linguist have not always be more enlightened than `` practical people '' and sometimes have insist on incredibly trivial point while neglect thing of much greater significance . 
as a result , many people have been confirm in their conviction that orthography design be not an activity to which expert can contribute anything but confusion . 
person , in vowel-length_and_syllabicity_in_kikuyu , examine one set of related orthographic question and its phonologic background in_detail . 
his objective be merely to determine `` what distinction of length and syllabicity it may be desirable to make explicit in a kikuyu orthography '' ( 59 ) . 
to do so , he find it necessary to examine the relevant part of the phonology thoroughly and in_detail . 
in the process , he develop some very significant observation about problem of a sort that be often difficult . 
a_few of his example be of very great interest , and the whole discussion of some importance for theory . 
his orthographic recommendation be no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on_the_one_hand or of superficiality on the other . 
rather he weigh each phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic usefulness . 
he conclude that some change can make in the current orthography which will appreciably improve its usefulness , but hesitate to suggest precise graphic device to effect these change . 
i hope his suggestion are give the consideration they deserve in kikuyu circle . 
this , however , will not exhaust their practical usefulness , as they rather clearly indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography design . 
we need many_more study of this sort if the design of written_language is to be put on a sound basis . 
one other paper deal with a phonologic problem : 
vowel_harmony_in_igbo , by person . 
this restate the already widely known fact in_terms_of prosody . 
as a restatement it make only a small contribution to knowledge of igbo . 
but it would seem more intended as a tract advocate the prosodic theory than a paper direct to the specific problem of igbo phonology . 
the paper have a certain value as a comparatively easy introduction to this approach , particularly since it treat a fairly simple and straightforward phenomenon where it be possible to compare it with a more traditional ( though not structural ) statement . 
it does show one feature of the system that has not been previously describe . 
but it does not , as it claim , demonstrate that this could not be treat by traditional method . 
it seem to me that it rather easily can . 
five of the papers deal with grammatical problem . 
on_the_whole they maintain much the same high standard , but they be much more difficult to discuss in_detail because of their wide variety of subject_matter . 
my comment must be brief than the papers deserve . 
person write_on the_verbal_radical_in_iraqw . 
this must be consider primarily an amendment and supplement to his early a_short_description_of_item-categories_in_iraqw . 
it exhibit much the same descriptive technique and be open to much the same criticism . 
the treatment seem unnecessarily loose-jointed and complex , largely because the method be lax and the analysis seem never to be push to a satisfactory or even a consistent stopping_point . 
there be more stem per item in athabascan , which express the fact that the athabascan language have undergo somewhat more change in diverge from proto athabascan than the yokuts language from proto yokuts . 
this may be because the athabascan divergence begin earlier ; or again because the athabascan language spread over a very_much larger territory ( include three wholly separated area ) ; or both . 
the differentiation however be not very_much greater , as show by the fact that athabascan show 3.46 stem per meaning slot as against 2.75 for yokuts , with a slightly greater number of language represent in our sample : 24 as against 21 . 
( on deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem / item rate become 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of language . ) 
these general fact are mention to make clear that the total situation in the two family be similar enough to warrant comparison . 
the great difference in the two set of figure be_due to difference in the two set of list use . 
these difference in_turn result from the fact that my yokuts vocabulary were build_up of term select mainly to insure unambiguity of english meaning between illiterate informant and myself , within a compact and uniform territorial area , but that person 's vocabulary be based_on person 's second glottochronological list which aim at eliminate all item which might be culturally or geographically determine . 
person in_short was try to develop a basic list that be universal ; i , one that was specifically adapt to the location . 
the result be that i include 70 animal name , but person only 4 ; and somewhat similarly for plant , 16 as against 4 . 
person , and therefore person , feel compelled to omit all term denote species or even genus ( fox , vulture , salmon , yellow_pine , manzanita ) ; their class of animal and plant term are restrict to generalization or recurrent part ( fish , bird , tree , grass , horn , tail , bark , root ) . 
the group be therefore really non comparable in content as_well as in size . 
other class are include only by myself ( interrogative , adverb ) or only by person and person ( pronoun , demonstrative ) . 
what we have left as reasonably comparable be four class : ( 1 ) body_part and product , which with a proportionally nearly even representation ( 51 term out of 253 , 25 out of 100 ) come_out with nearly even ratio ; 2.6 and 2.7 ; ( 2 ) nature ( 29 term against 17 ) , ratio 3.3 versus 4.1 ; ( 3 ) adjective ( 16 , 15 term ) , ratio 3.9 versus 4.7 ; ( 4 ) verb ( 9 , 22 term ) , ratio 4.0 versus 3.4 . 
it will be see that where the scope be similar , the athabascan ratio come_out somewhat high ( as indeed they ought to with a total ratio of 2.8 as against 3.5 or 4 : 5 ) except for verb , where alone the athabascan ratio be low . 
this exception may be connected with person 's use of a much higher percentage of verb : 
22  of his total list as against 3.5  in mine . 
or the exception may be_due to a particular durability peculiar to the athabascan verb . 
more word_class ratio determine in more language will no_doubt ultimately answer the question . 
if word_class differ in their resistance or liability to stem replacement within meaning slot , it be conceivable that individual meaning also differ with fair consistence trans lingually . 
person 's athabascan and my yokuts share 71 identical meaning ( with allowance for several near synonym like stomach belly , big large , long far , many much , die dead , say speak ) . 
for yokuts , i tabulate these 71 item in five column , according_as they were express by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and more_than 4 stem . 
the total for these five category be not too uneven , namely 20 , 15 , 11 , 16 , 9 respectively . 
for athabascan , with a greater range of stem , the first two of five corresponding column be identical , 1 and 2 stem ; the three others had to be spread somewhat , and are headed respectively * * f ; * * f ; and * * f stem . 
while the particular limit of these grouping may seem artificially arbitrary ; they do fairly express a corresponding grouping of more variable material , and they eventuate also in five class , along a similar scale , contain approximately equal number of case , namely 19 , 14 , 15 , 11 , 12 in athabascan . 
when now we count the frequency of the 71 item in the two language family appear in the same column or grade , or one column or grade apart , or two or three or four , we find these difference : * * f this distribution can be summarize by average the distance in grade apart : * * f ; which , divide by * * f give a mean of 1.07 grade apart . 
if the distribution of the 71 item be wholly concordant in the two family , the distance would of_course be 0 . 
if it be wholly random and unrelated , it would be 20 , assume the five class be equal in n , which approximately they be . 
the actual mean of 1.07 be about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 20 of no correlation , it be evident that there be a pretty fair degree of similarity in the behavior even of particular individual item of meaning as regard long-term stem displacement . 
in 1960 , person publish basic vocabulary in some mon-khmer language al 2 , no. 3 , pp. 7 - 11 ) , which compare 8 mon-khmer language with the i-e language data on which person base the revised retention rate ( * * f ) in_place_of original ( * * f ) , and his revised 100 word basic glottochronological list in towards_greater_accuracy ( ijal_21_:_121_-_137 ) . 
person ' finding be , first , `` that the individual item vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence '' ; but , second , `` that the semantic group be surprisingly unvarying in their average persistence '' ( as between m-k and i-e . 
his first conclusion , on behavior of individual item , be negative , whereas mine ( on ath. and yok . ) be partially positive . 
his second conclusion , on semantic word_class , agree with mine . 
this second conclusion , independently arrive at by independent study of material from two pair of language family as different and remote from one another as these four be , cannot be ignore . 
person also present a simple equation for derive an index of persistence , which weight not_only the number of stem ( ' root ' ) per meaning , but their relative_frequency . 
thus his persistence value for some stem frequency per meaning be : stem identical in 8 language , 100  ; stem frequency 7 and 1 , 86  ; stem frequency 4 and 4 , 64  ; stem frequency 4 , 3 , and 1 , 57  . 
his formula will have to be weigh , may be alter or improve , and it should be test on additional body of material . 
but consideration of the frequency of stem per constant meaning seem to be establish as have significance in comparative situation with diachronic and classificatory relevance ; and person presumably be on_the_way with a further contribution in this area . 
as to relative_frequency of competing root ( 7 - 1 vs. 4 - 4 , etc. ) , person with his ' weighting ' seem to be the first to have consider the significance this might have . 
the problem need further exploration . 
i be at_least conscious of the distinction in my full yokuts presentation that await publication , in which , in list ' two_stem_meanings ' , i set_off by asterisk those form in which n of stem b be * * f of stem a_3 , the unasterisked ones stand_for * * f ; or under ' four_stems ' , i set_off by asterisk case where the combined n of stem * * f be * * f . 
these finding , and_others which will in_time be develop , will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry . 
if adjectival meaning show relatively low retentiveness of stem , as i be confident will prove to be the case in most language of the world , why should our basic list include 15 percent of these unstable form , but only 8 percent of animal and plant which replace much more slowly ? 
had person substitute for his 15 adjectival slot 15 good animal and plant item , his rate of stem replacement would have be low and the age of athabascan language separation smaller . 
and irrespective of the outcome in century elapse since split , calculation obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable unit than with variously unstable ones . 
it be evident that person has not_only have much experience with basic vocabulary in many language but has acquire great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior of lexical item . 
why then this urge to include unstable item in his basic list ? 
it be the urge to obtain a list as free_of geographical and cultural conditioning as possible . 
and why that insistence ? 
it be the hope of attain a list of item of universal occurrence . 
but it is become increasingly evident that such a hope be a snare . 
not that such a list cannot be construct ; but the nearer it comes_to attain universality , the less significant will it be linguistically . 
its term will tend to be labile or vague , and they will fit actual language more_and_more badly . 
the practical operational problem of lexicostatistics be the establishment of a basic list of item of meaning against which the particular form or term of language can be match as the medium of comparison . 
the most important quality of the meaning be that they should be as definable as possible . 
in proportion as meaning be concrete , we can better rely_on their be insulate and distinctive . 
an elephant or a fox or a swan or a coco_palm or a banana possess in unusually high degree this quality of obvious , commonsense , indubitable identity , as do an eye or tooth or nail . 
they isolate out easily , naturally , and unambiguously from the continuum of nature and existence ; and they should be give priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these quality . 
with the universal list as his weapon , person has extend his march of conquest farther and farther into the past , eight , ten , twelve millennium back . 
and he has proclaim greater or less affiliation between all western_hemisphere language . 
some of_this may prove to be true , or even considerable of_it , whether by genetic ramification or by diffusion and coalescence . 
but the farther out he move , the thin will be his hold on conclusive evidence , and the larger the speculative component in his inference . 
he has traverse province and kingdom , but he has not consolidate them behind him , nor does he control them . 
he has announce result on hokan , penutian , uto-aztecan , and almost all other american family and phylum , and has diagram their degree of interrelation ; but he has not work_out by lexicostatistics one comprehensively complete classification of even a single family other_than salish . 
that be his privilege . 
the remote , cloudy , possible have value of its own - value of scope , stimulus , potential , and imagination . 
but there be also a firm aspect to lexicostatistics : 
the aspect of learn the internal organization of obvious natural genetic group of language as_well as their more remote and elusive external link ; of classification first , with elapsed age merely a by-product ; of acquire evidential knowledge of what happen in athabascan , in yokuts , in uto-aztecan in the last few thousand year as_well as forecast what more anciently may have happen between them . 
this involve step-by-step progress , and such will have to be the day_by_day work of lexicostatistics as a growing body of scientific inquiry . 
if of the founder of glottochronology person has escape our steady plodding , and person has repudiate his own share in the founding , that be no reason why we should swerve . 
there is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by person 's rule and procedure since his predilection and aim have grow so vast . 
it seem time to consider a revision of operational procedure for lexicostatistic study on a more humble , solid , and limited basis . 
i would propose , first , an abandonment of attempt at a universal lexical list , as intrinsically unachievable , and operationally inadequate in proportion as it is achieve . 
i would propose , next , as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic list , item whose form show as high an empirical retention rate as possible . 
there would be no conceivable sense in go_to the opposite extreme of select item whose form be the most unstable . 
an attempted middle course might lead to device like a 5000 - word alphabetize dictionary from which every fiftieth word was select . 
unemployed older worker who have no expectation of secure employment in the occupation in which they be skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future . 
some vocational training_school provide such training , but the current need exceed the facility . 
the present federal program of vocational education begin in 1917 with the passage of the smith-hughes_act , which provide a continuing annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support , on a match basis , state administer program of vocational education in agriculture , trade , industrial skill and home_economics . 
since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related act have extend this federal program . 
the george-barden_act of 1946 raise the previous increase in annual authorization to $ 29 million in_addition to the $ 7 million under the smith_act . 
the health_amendment_act of 1956 add $ 5 million for practical_nurse training . 
the latest major change in this program was introduce by the national_defense_education_act of 1958 , title 8 , of which amend the george-barden_act . 
annual authorization of $ 15 million were add for area vocational education program that meet national defense need for highly skilled technician . 
the federal program of vocational education merely provide financial_aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education program in public school . 
the initiative , administration and control remain primarily with the local school district . 
even the state remain primarily in an assist role , provide leadership and teacher training . 
federal assistance is limit to half of the total expenditure , and the state or local district must pay at_least half . 
the state may decide to encourage local program by pay half of the cost , or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it . 
throughout the history of the program , state_government expenditure in the aggregate have usually match or exceed the federal expenditure , while local district all_together have spend more_than either federal or state_government . 
today , federal funds account_for only one-fifth of the nation 's expenditure for vocational education . 
the greatest impact of the match fund principle has be in initially encourage the poor state and school district to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds . 
national defense consideration have be the major reason behind most federal training expenditure in recent decade . 
during world_war 2 , about 7.5 million person were enroll in course organize under two special program administer by state and local school authorities : ( 1 ) vocational education for national defense , and ( 2 ) war production training . 
the total cost of the five year program be $ 297 million . 
for the smith-hughes , george-barden , and national_defense_act of 1958 , the cumulative total of federal expenditure in 42 year be only about $ 740 million . 
no comparable measure be available of enrollment and expenditure for private vocational education training . 
there be a great number and variety of private commercial school , trade_school and technical_school . 
in_addition , many large corporation operate their own formal training_program . 
a recent study indicate that 85 percent of the nation 's largest corporation conduct educational program involve some class meeting and examination . 
most skilled_worker industrial workers , nevertheless , still acquire their skill outside of formal training institution . 
the group of group has estimate that three out of five skilled_worker and one out of five technician have not been formally train . 
there be little doubt that the student benefit from vocational education . 
employer prefer to hire youth with such training rather_than those without , and most graduate of vocational training go to work in job related to their training . 
vocational educator do not claim that school training alone make skilled_worker , but it provide the essential groundwork for develop skill . 
in most state , trade and industrial training is provide in a minority of the high_school , usually located in the larger city . 
in arkansas fewer than 6 percent of the high_school offer trade and industrial course . 
in illinois about 13 percent of the school have program , and in pennsylvania 11 percent . 
an important recent trend be the development of area vocational_school . 
for a number of year kentucky , louisiana and several other state have been build state sponsor vocational education school that serve nearby school district in several county . 
these school are intend to provide the facility and specialized curriculum that would not be possible for very small school district . 
transportation may be provide from nearby school district . 
course are provide mainly for post high_school day program ; but sometimes arrangement also are make for high_school student to attend , and evening extension course also may be conduct . 
the title 8 , program of the national_defense_education_act of 1958 be a great spur to this trend toward area school . 
by 1960 there be such school in all but 4 state . 
they were operate in 10 of the 17 major area of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor area . 
an extension of this program into the other distressed area should be undertake . 
some of this trend toward area vocational_school has be related to the problem of persistent labor surplus area and their desire to attract new industry . 
the major training need of a new industrial plant be a short period of pre employment training for a large_number of semiskilled machine operator . 
a_few key skilled_worker experienced in the company 's type of work usually must be bring_in with the plant manager , or hire away from a similar plant elsewhere . 
a prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run advantage of training_program in the area to supply future skilled_worker and provide supplementary extension course for its employee . 
the existence of a public_school vocational training_program in trade and industry provide a base from which such need can be fill . 
additional course can readily be add and special cooperative program work_out with any new industry if the basic facility , staff and program be in being . 
thus , besides the training provide to youth in school , the existence of the school program can have supplementary benefit to industry which make it an asset to industrial development effort . 
few state make effective use of their existing vocational education program or funds for the purpose of attract new industry . 
the opportunity exist for state to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad_hoc flexible basis to subsidize any local preemployment_training_program that my be quickly set_up in a community to aid a new industrial plant . 
the major weakness of vocational training_program in labor surplus area be their focus on serve solely local job demand . 
this weakness be not unique to labor surplus area , for it be inherent in the system of local school district in this country . 
planning of vocational education program and course is orient to local employer need for trained_worker . 
all the manual for set_up vocational course stress the importance of first make a local survey of skill need , of estimate the growth of local job , and of consult with local employer on the type of course and their content . 
furthermore , there be a cautious conservatism on the part of those make local skill survey . 
local job can be see and count , while opportunity elsewhere are regard_as more hypothetical . 
while the u.s. department_of_labor have a program of project industry and occupational employment trend and publish current outlook statement , there be little tangible evidence that these projection have been use extensively in local curriculum planning . 
the u.s. group continue to stress local survey rather_than national survey . 
this procedure be extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus area with a long history of declining employment . 
elaborate study have been make in labor surplus area in_order to identify sufficient number of local job vacancy and future replacement need for certain skill to justify training_program for those skill . 
no effort is make in the same study to present information on regional or national demand trend in these skill or to consider whether regional or national demand for other skill might provide much better opportunity for the youth to be train . 
moreover , the current information on what type of training are need and possible be too limited and fragmentary . 
there simply be not enough material available on the type of job skill that be in_demand and the type of training_program that be required or most suitable . 
much of the available information come not from the federal_government but from an exchange of experience among state . 
state and local agency in the vocational education field must be encourage to adopt a wide outlook on future job opportunity . 
there be a need for an expanded federal effort to provide research and information to help guide state education department and local school_board in existing program . 
a related question be whether unemployed worker can be motivate to take the training provide . 
there be little evidence that existing public or private training_program have any great difficulty get student to enroll in their program , even though they must pay tuition , receive no subsistence payment , and are not guarantee a job . 
however , there always be some limit to the number who will spend the time and effort to acquire training . 
again , one major difficulty be the local focus . 
a training_program in a depressed area may have few enrollee unless there be some apparent prospect for better employment opportunity afterwards , and the prospect may be poor if the training is aim solely at job in the local community . 
if there be adequate information on job opportunity for skilled job elsewhere , many_more worker can be expect to respond . 
another problem be who will pay for the training . 
local school district be hard-pressed financially and unenthusiastic about vocational training . 
program usually are expand only when outside funds be available or local business_leader demand it . 
even industrial development leader find it hard to win local support for training unless a new industry be in_sight and request it . 
state_government have been take the lead in establish area vocational_school , but their focus be still on area job opportunity . 
only the federal_government be likely to be able to take a long-run and nationwide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower need . 
if only state funds were use to pay for the vocational education , it could be argue that the state should not have_to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employer in other state . 
however , if federal funds are use , it would be entirely appropriate to train worker for job which could be obtain elsewhere as_well_as for job in the area of chronic unemployment . 
such training would increase the tendency of worker to leave the area and find job in other locality . 
a further possibility is suggest by the example of the g._i. bill and also by some recent trend in attitude toward improve college education : that_is to provide financial assistance to individual for vocational training when local facility be inadequate . 
this probably would require some support for subsistence as_well_as for tuition , but the total would be no great than for the proposal of unemployment_compensation or a group . 
a maximum of $ 600 per_year per student would enable many to take training away from home . 
a program of financial assistance would permit place emphasis on the national interest in train highly skilled labor . 
instead of being limit to the poor training facility in remote area , the student would be able to move to large institution of concentrated specialized training . 
such specialized training institution could be located near the most rapidly grow industry , where the equipment and job experience exist and where the future employment opportunity be located . 
this would heighten possibility for part-time cooperative , on_the_job and extension training . 
personal financial assistance would enable more emphasis to be placed on the interest of the individual . 
his aptitude and preference could be give more weight in select the proper training . 
wage price policy of industry be the result of a complex of force - no single explanation has been find which apply to all case . 
the purpose of this paper be to analyze one possible force which has not been treat in the literature , but which we believe make a significant contribution to explain the wage price behavior of a_few very important industry . 
while there may be several such industry to which the model of this paper be applicable , the author make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wage and price in the steel industry of the united_states since world_war_ii , . 
indeed , the apparent stiffening of the industry 's attitude in the recent steel strike have a direct explanation in_terms_of the model here present . 
the model of this paper consider an industry which is not characterize by vigorous price_competition , but which be so basic that its wage price policy be hold in_check by continuous critical public scrutiny . 
where the industry 's product price has been keep below the `` profit-maximizing '' and `` entry limiting '' price due_to fear of public reaction , the profit seeking producer have an interest in offer little real resistance to wage demand . 
the contribution of this paper be a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implication . 
in_order_to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public limit price '' on `` key '' wage bargain , we deliberately simplify the model by abstract from other force , such_as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation . 
for expository purpose , this is best treat as a model which spell_out the condition under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wage even in the absence of union pressure for high wage . 
part 1 , below describe this abstract model by spell_out its assumption . 
part 2 , discuss the operation of the model and derive some significant conclusion . 
part 3 , discuss the empirical relevance and policy implication of the conclusion . 
part 4 , be a brief summary . 
the mathematical appendix present the rigorous argument , but is best read after part 1 , in_order that the assumption underlie the equation may be explicit . 
the industry with which this model be concerned be a basic industry , produce a substantial share of gross_national_product . 
price_competition be lacking . 
for the purpose of set the product price , the industry behave as a single entity . 
in wage negotiation , the industry bargain as a unit with a single union . 
we are concerned with aggregate demand for the industry 's product . 
the manner in which this is share among firm is take as given . 
in any given time_period , the aggregate demand for the industry 's product is determine by two thing : the price charge by the industry , and the level of gnp . 
for the purpose of this discussion , the problem of relative price be encompass in these two variable , since gnp include other price . 
( we abstract here from technological progress and assume that price of all other product change proportionately . ) 
the form of the industry demand function be one which make quantity demand vary inversely with the product price , and vary directly with the level of gnp . 
the industry of this model be so important that its wage and price policy are affect with a public interest . 
because of its importance , and because the lack of price_competition be well recognized , the industry be under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justify by cost increase . 
the threat of effective antitrust action , provoke by `` gouge the public '' through price increase not justify by cost increase , and fear of endanger relations with customer , congress , the general public and the press , all operate to keep price increase in some relation to cost increase . 
for the industry of this model , the effect of such public pressure in the past has be to hold the price well below the short-run profit maximize price ( given the wage rate and the level of gnp ) , and even below the entry limited price ( but not below average_cost ) . 
for such an industry , it be only `` safe '' to raise its price if such an increase is manifestly `` justify '' by rising cost ( due_to rising wage , etc . ) . 
thus , if public pressure set the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge , this pressure be itself a function of the wage rate . 
in this model , we abstract from all non wage source of cost change , so that the `` public limit price '' only rise as the wage rate rise . 
in such circumstance , it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate . 
since marginal_cost rise when the wage rate rise , the profit-maximizing price also rise when the public limit price is elevate , and be likely to remain well above the latter . 
the entry limiting price will also be raise for potential domestic competition , but unless general inflation permit profit_margin to increase proportionately throughout the economy , we might expect the public limit price to approach the entry limit price . 
the foreign entry limit price would be approach more rapidly , since domestic wage rate do not enter foreign cost directly . 
where this approach become critical , the industry can be expect to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its sincerity in `` resist '' the wage pressure of a powerful union , request tariff relief after it has `` reluctantly '' accede to the union pressure . 
whether or not it be in the industry 's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depend_upon the extent to which the public limit price rise in response to a basic wage increase , and the relation of this response to the increase in cost accompany the wage increase . 
the extent to which the public limit price is raise by a given increase in the basic wage rate be itself a function of three thing : the passage of time , the level of gnp , and the size of the wage increase . 
we are abstract from the fact of strike here , but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public limit price is raise by a given increase in the basic wage rate be also a function of the show of resistance put_up by the industry . 
the industry may deliberately take a strike , not to put pressure on the union , but in_order to `` educate '' the government and the customer of the industry . 
as a strike continue , these party increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement . 
they become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claim the wage bargain would entail . 
public indignation and resistance to wage price increase be obviously much less when the increase be on the order of 3  per_annum than when the increase be on the order of 3  per month . 
the simple passage of an additional eleven month ' time make the second 3  boost more acceptable . 
thus , the public limit price is raise further by a given wage increase the longer it has be since the previous price increase . 
notice , however , that the passage of time does not permit the raising of price per_se , without an accompanying wage increase . 
similarly , high level of gnp do not , in themselves , provide ground for raise price , but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise price high for a given wage increase . 
this is not extend to anticipated level of gnp , however - only the current level of gnp affect the public pressure against wage price increase . 
finally , since the public require some restraint on the part of the company , larger wage increase call_for less_than proportionately larger price increase ( e.g. , if a wage increase of 5  allow a price increase of 7  , a wage increase of 10  allow a price increase of something less_than 14  ) . 
we assume that average total unit_cost in the relevant region of operation be constant with_respect_to quantity produce ( the average_cost curve be horizontal , and therefore be identical with the marginal_cost curve ) , and be the same for every firm ( and therefore for the industry ) . 
the level of this average_cost is determine by factor price , technology , and_so_forth . 
as we have note , however , we are abstract from change in all determinant of this level except for change in the wage rate . 
the level of average_cost ( equal to marginal_cost ) be thus strictly a function of the wage rate . 
the single union which face the industry does not restrict its membership , and there be an adequate supply of labor available to the firm of the industry at the going wage rate . 
the union does not regard unemployment of its own member as a matter of concern when set its own wage policy - its concern with employment make itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment . 
the union vigorously demand wage increase from productivity increase , and wage increase to offset cost_of_living increase , but we abstract from these force here . 
for our present purpose we assume that the sole subject of bargaining be the basic wage rate ( not include productivity improvement factor or cost_of_living adjustment ) , and it be this basic wage rate which determine the level of cost . 
productivity be something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time_period be not even well_known to the industry , much_less to the union or to the public . 
disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbate the problem of agree how an increase in profit_margin related to a productivity increase should be share . 
the existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wage does not contradict the assumption that the union be willing to settle for cost_of_living and productivity share increase as distinct from a cost raising increase in the basic wage rate . 
we assume further that the union recognize the possibility that price level increase may offset wage rate increase , and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price increase arise from its own wage increase upon the `` real '' wage rate . 
for internal political reason , the union ask for ( and accept ) increase in the basic wage rate , and would vigorously oppose a reduction in this rate , but the adjustment of the basic wage rate upwards be essentially up_to the discretion of the company of the industry . 
change in the basic wage rate be cost raising , and they constitute an argument for raise price . 
however , it be not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is cause by a given change in the basic wage rate , although the company are presume to have reliable estimate of this magnitude . 
in this model , then , the industry is presume to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate , but since such a change be the only effective means to raise price they may , in circumstance to be spell_out in part 2 , below , find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise . 
thus , for non negative change in the basic wage rate , the industry become the active wage_setter , since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry acquiescence . 
the presumption in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be unchanged in this case , on the grounds that it be `` clearly '' not in the interest of the industry to raise wage gratuitously . 
from this presumption it be an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increase in the basic wage rate must be_due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assume in our model . 
it is this conclusion that we challenge ; we do so by disprove the presumption on which it is base . 
it be convenient to assume that the union industry contract be of one year 's duration . 
in the century from 1815 to 1914 the law_of_nations become international_law . 
several factor contribute to this change . 
the congress_of_vienna be a convenient starting_point because it both epitomize and symbolize what was to follow . 
here in 1815 the great nation assemble to legislate not merely for europe , but for the world . 
thus the congress mark a formal recognition of the political_system that be central to world politics for a century . 
international_law had to fit the condition of europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interest of the great european_nation collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense . 
essentially this impose two condition : first , international_law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political_system in which a number of state be competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignment with one another ; second , it had to be compatible with the value-system that they share . 
in both respect , international_law was europeanize . 
it be not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two condition . 
on_the_one_hand , the major european_nation had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty , independence , formal equality - thus insure for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of alignment '' that the system require and to avoid anything approach a repetition of the disastrous napoleonic experience . 
but there be no pressing need to maintain these same standard with regard_to most_of the rest of the world . 
thus , theory and doctrine applicable among the great nation and the small european state did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful society elsewhere . 
political interference in africa and asia and even in latin_america ( though limited in latin_america by the special interest of the united_states as express in the monroe_doctrine , itself from the outset related_to european politics and long dependent upon the `` balance_of_power '' system in europe ) be necessary in_order to preserve both common economic_value and the european `` balance_of_power '' itself . 
a nation such_as switzerland could be neutralize by agreement and could be rely_upon to protect its neutrality ; more doubtful , but possible , ( with an assist from the north ) be the neutralization of the latin-american country ; out_of_the_question be the neutralization of asia and africa . 
this europeanization of the law was make explicit by a number of 19th century scholar . 
more emphasis was put upon the fact that international_law be the law of `` civilized nation '' ; person and person , the great early american scholar , repeatedly made_use_of this phrase , or of `` christian nation '' , which be a substantial equivalent . 
person state that the public_law was essentially `` limit to the civilized and christian people of europe or to those of european origin '' . 
of_course it had always be of european origin in_fact , but it had maintain a universal outlook under the natural_law theory . 
now , with virtually every writer , not_only was the european origin of public_law acknowledge as a historical phenomenon , but the rule thus establish by the advanced civilization of europe were to be impose on others . 
the european custom on which international_law was base were to become , by force and fiat , the custom that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign state . 
person , for_example , be quite explicit on this point when he say `` state outside european civilization must formally enter into the circle of law govern country . 
they must do something with the acquiescence of the latter , or some of them , which amount to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction '' . 
during the nineteenth century these view were protest by virtually all the latin_american writer , though ineffectively , just as the new nation of africa and asia protest them , with more effect , today . 
a number of other nineteenth century development contribute to the transmutation of the law_of_nations into international_law ; that_is , from aspect of a universal system of justice into particular rule govern the relations of sovereign state . 
the difference be important , for although the old law_of_nations did cover relationship among sovereign , this be by_no_means its exclusive domain . 
the law of nature govern sovereign in their relationship to their own citizen , to foreigner , and to each other in a conceptually unified system . 
the theory of international_law , which in the nineteenth century become common to virtually all writer in europe and america , break this unity and this universality . 
it lose sight of the individual almost entirely and confine itself to rule limit the exercise of state power for reason essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations . 
no_longer did the sovereign look_to the law_of_nations to determine what he ought to do ; his search was merely for rule that might limit his freedom of action . 
to appreciate this development , we must relate it to other aspect of nineteenth century philosophy . 
first , and most obvious , be the grow nationalism and the tendency to regard the state , and the individual 's identification with the state , as transcend other tie of social solidarity . 
national identification be not new , but it was accelerate in intensity and scope throughout europe as new unification occur . 
it reach its ultimate philosophical statement in notion of `` state will '' put_forward by the german , especially by hegel , although political philosopher will recognize its origin in the rejected doctrine of person . 
national identification was reflect jurisprudentially in law theory which incorporate this hegelian abstraction and see law , domestic and international , simply as its formal reflection . 
in the international community this reduce law to person 's auto_limitation . 
a state , the highest form of human organization in fact and theory , could be subject to law only by a manifestation of self-will , or consent . 
according_to the new theory , the nineteenth century corporate sovereign be `` sovereign '' in a quite new and different sense from his historical predecessor . 
he no_longer seek to find the law ; he make it ; he could be subject to law only because he agree to be . 
there be no law , domestic or international , except that will by , acknowledge by , or consent to by state . 
hidden behind hegelian abstraction were more practical reason for a changing jurisprudence . 
related_to , but distinguishable from , nationalism was the growth of democracy in one form or another . 
increased participation in politics and the demand of various group for status and recognition have dramatic effect upon law institution . 
the effort of various interest group to control or influence governmental decision , particularly when take in conjunction with the impact of industrialization , lead to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby policy could be formulate and enforce as law through bureaucratic institution . 
law become a conscious process , something more than simply do justice and look_to local custom and a common morality for applicable norm . 
particularly be this true when the norm previously apply be no_longer satisfactory to many , when custom were rapidly change as the force of the new productivity were harness . 
the old way of doing thing , which depend_on a relatively stable community with stable idea deal with familiar situation , be no_longer adequate_to the task . 
first be the period of codification of exist law : the code_napoleon in france and the peculiar codification that , in_fact , result from person 's restatement and ordering of the common_law in england . 
codification was follow in all country by a growing amount of legislation , some change and adjust the old law , much deal with entirely new situation . 
the legislative mill have been grind ever since , and when its cumbersome process be no_longer adequate_to the task , a limited legislative authority was delegate in one form or another , to the executive . 
whereas the eighteenth century had be a time in which man seek justice , the nineteenth and twentieth have be century in which man be satisfied with law . 
indeed , with developed positivism , the separation of law from justice , or from morality generally , become quite specific . 
in municipal system we tend to view what be called positivism as fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increase the power of parliament - the elected representative - at the expense of the more conservative judiciary . 
when the power of the latter was make both limited and explicit - when norm were clarify and make more precise and the creation of new norm was place exclusively in parliamentary hands - two purpose were serve : government was make subservient to an institutionalized popular will , and law become a rational system for implement that will , for serve conscious goal , for embody the `` public policy '' . 
it be true that , initially , the task was to remove restriction that , it was think , inhibit the free flow of money , goods , and labor ; but even laissez_faire be a conscious policy . 
law was see as an emanation of the `` sovereign will '' . 
however , the sovereign be not person ' absolute monarch but rather the parliamentary sovereign of person . 
it be , too , an optimistic philosophy , and , though it separate law from morality , it be by_no_means an immoral or amoral one . 
man , through democratic institution of government and economic freedom , be master of his destiny . 
the theory did not require , though it unfortunately might acquire , a hegelian mystique . 
it be merely a rationalization and ordering of new institution of popular government . 
it be not opposed to either justice or morality ; it merely wish to minimize subjective view of official who wield public authority . 
particularly be this true as laissez-faire capitalism become the dominant credo of western society . 
to free the factor of production be a major objective of the rise bourgeoisie , and this objective require that governmental authority - administrative_official and judge - be limit as precisely and explicitly as possible ; that old custom which inhibit trade be abrogate ; that business be free from governmental supervision and notion of morality which might clog the automatic adjustment of the free market ; that obligation of status that be inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be do away with . 
contract - conceive as the free bargain of formal equal - replace the implied obligation of a more static and status conscious society . 
indeed , contract be the dominant legal theme of the century , the touchstone of the free society . 
government itself was base upon contract ; business_organization - the corporation - was analyze in contractual term ; trade was base on freedom of contract , and money was lend and borrow on contractual term ; even marriage and the family was see as a contractual arrangement . 
it be not surprising that the international obligation of state were also view in_terms_of contract . 
in_fact , some - person be the principal example - go so far as to say that all international_law could be trace to the single legal norm , pacta sunt servanda . 
the displacement ( at_least to a considerable extent ) of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth and eighteenth century by positivism reshape both international_law theory and doctrine . 
in_the_first_place the new doctrine bring a formal separation of international from municipal law , reject the early view that both be part of a universal legal_system . 
one result was to nationalize much that had been regard_as the law_of_nations . 
admiralty_law , the law_merchant , and the host of problem which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country were all sever from the old law_of_nations and make dependent_on the several national law . 
private international_law ( which american call the `` conflict of law '' ) was thus segregate from international_law proper , or , as it is often call , public international_law . 
state be free to enact , within broad though ( perhaps ) determinate limit , their own rule as_to the application of foreign law by their court , to vary the law_merchant , and to enact legislation with regard_to many claim arise on the high_sea . 
the change be not quite so dramatic as it sound because in_fact common norm continue to be invoke by municipal court and were only gradually change by legislation , and then largely in marginal situation . 
`` well '' - say person . 
`` i take a little time to think_over it over '' . 
it be awkward : very awkward . 
there would be all the nuisance of contact someone else to take_over . 
someone reasonably trustworthy . 
and person would hear about it . 
and person know - 
`` time '' , say person , and he smile very sweet and slow at person . 
`` not too much time , because i 'll be need some more myself pretty_much right_away . 
and i do favor for you , big favor not so long back , did n't i , and i be right here to take_on where person leave_off . 
no trouble . 
i do n't want no trouble , you do n't want no trouble , nobody want trouble , person '' . 
dear_heaven , no , think person , turn_away as another man come_in . 
he straighten his tie at the mirror with a shaking hand ; the genial smile seem painted on his face . 
person know - speak_of dangerous information ! 
person know too_much entirely already . 
really he have person at_bay . 
`` big favor i do you . 
of_course there 's this deal o ' person 's - and person 's - kinda hangin_'_fire , ai n't it , maybe you 've been kinda worry ' over that . 
and can n't say i blame you '' , say person thoughtfully . 
`` this deal with the ace o ' spade . 
anything to do with an ace o ' spade , bad_luck '' . 
ace_of_spades - a widow , that be what they call a widow , these low-class crook remember person distractedly . 
all about that person know , too . 
when thing get a_little out_of_hand , they very rapidly get a_lot out_of_hand - it seem to be a general rule . 
all just by_chance , and in_a_way trace back to poor person , all_of it , because naturally - brother , live together - and person - 
person did not at all like the look on person 's regular featured , almost girlishly good-looking face - or indeed anything about person . 
person be not a man who think very_much about moral_principle ; he find money much more interesting ; but all_the_same he think now , uneasily , of the way in which person earn his living - and pay for his own stuff - and eye the soft smile , and the spaniel like dark eye , and he feel a_little ill . 
`` look , my friend '' , he say , `` in my life i learn , how be it the proverb say , better an ounce of prevention to a pound of cure . 
i stay in business so long because i be careful . 
two_weeks , a month , we talk_over it over again , and maybe if nothing happen meanwhile to say the cop know this_and_that , then we make a little deal , is n't it '' ? 
`` that be a long while '' , say person . 
`` i tell you , you want to leave it that way , i do n't fool_around with it . 
i go over to person and get fix_up there . 
i can n't wait no two_weeks '' . 
and person did n't like person , but what with person and three of his boy inside , and not likely to come_out - and person such a valuable salesman , person say - all the nuisance and danger of get_in_touch with practically a whole new bunch of boy - why did everything have to happen at_once ? 
person say stupidly , `` why , you ai n't turn_down person down , are you , person ? 
i mean , we all figure - i guess anybody 'd figure - person '' - 
person give him an affectionate smile . 
`` person too smart a fellow want to get_rid_of me '' , he say . 
`` it 's o.k. , person , everything be o.k. be n't it , person '' ? 
oh , god , the name repeat over_and_over , anybody to hear - not be a fool , person know why . 
but aside from everything else , it would scarcely be pleasant to have dealings with one who be nominally an underling and actually hold - you could say - the whip_hand . 
and all because of person ! 
if person had dream of all the trouble that person would eventually cause - 
of_course , there was another factor . 
person worth his weight in gold right now , but these user , they sometimes go_down fast . 
who know , person might not last long . 
the sweat break_out on person ' forehead as he realize he had been actually think - hope - plan - perhaps - 
good_god_above , had not person be enough ? 
he pat person 's thin shoulder paternally . 
`` now you do n't want to go_on talk that way '' , he say . 
`` sure , sure , you be the one take_over for person , soon as i get the supply , get start up again , is n't it ? 
you do n't need worry , person . 
i tell you , i know how it be with you , my friend , i sympathize , and i 'll make it a special point - a special favor - get_in_touch , and get some stuff just for you . 
i do n't know if i can manage it tonight or tomorrow , but i 'll try my best , my friend . 
you see , you got to remember , we all get schedule , like any business ! 
my man , he won n't be around a little while , he just fix_up me up with this stuff they take_out of the group . 
it 's awkward , you see that , is n't it '' ? 
`` well , that be your business , person '' , say person , and his dreamy eye move past person ' shoulder to gaze vaguely out the ground_glass window . 
`` i appreciate it , you do that . 
sure . 
we do n't none of us want no trouble . 
i be in a room over the group on location , you just ask for me there , you want see me . 
or maybe i call you - tonight ? 
about nine o ' clock , i call and see if you get any . 
a couple deck for me , person - and ten twelve to sell , see , i like to have a little ready cash '' . 
`` oh , now , i do n't know about that much '' , say person . 
`` and you know , person , person , he always keep it a strict cash_basis , like they say '' - 
`` sure '' , say person . 
`` sure , person . 
fifty a throw , that the deal ? 
sure . 
i bring you the cash , say five_hundred for ten deck . 
never mind how much i cut it , how much i get '' , and he smile his sleepy smile again . 
`` standard deal , person . 
you go ' n ' have_a_look round for it '' . 
`` i do_one's_best my best '' , say person earnestly , `` just for you , my friend . 
this is awkward for everybody , is n't it , we all got to put_up with inconvenience sometimes . 
but i do_one's_best my best for you '' . 
he get_out of there in a hurry , brush past another man in the door , mop his brow . 
the expedient thing - yes , very true , one must make_do as one could , in some situation . 
it could all be straighten_out later . 
not very_much later , but when thing had settle_down a_little . 
after this deal with the person woman go_through . 
an ace_of_spades . 
he be not a superstitious man , but he feel perhaps there was a little something in_that , indeed . 
he rather wish he had never get_into the business , and still - scarcely to be resist , a nice little profit with not much work involve , easy_money . 
person , who would be person so very soon now , ring_up her first sale of the day and count back the change . 
she did not notice that the customer seize her purchase and turn_away without a smile or a word of thanks . 
usually she mark the few who did thank_you , you did n't get that kind much in a place like this : and she play a little game with herself , see how downright rude she could act to the others , before they 'd take offense , threaten to call the manager . 
funny how seldom they did : used_to it , probably . 
the kind who come into a cheap store like this ! 
grab , snatch , i see that first ! 
and , here , i 'll take this , i be before her , you wait_on me now or i do n't bother with it , see ! 
this kind of place . 
she 'd be through here , just no time at_all - leave this kind of thing ' way behind . 
off at noon , and she 'd never come_back . 
never have to . 
money - a_lot of money , enough . 
she 'd be smart about it , get him to give it to her in little bill so 's nobody would suspect - maybe could n't get it until monday account_of that , the bank - but that be n't really long to wait . 
not when she 'd wait so long already . 
no need say anything at_all to the old_woman . 
she had it all plan out , how she 'd do . 
she 'd say she did n't feel well on sunday , could n't go_to church - there 'd be a little argument , but she could be stubborn - and when the old_woman had go , quick pack the things she 'd need to take , all but the dress she 'd wear monday , and take the bag down to that place in the station where you could put things in a locker overnight , for a dime . 
then on monday morning - or it might have to be tuesday - get_up and leave just the usual time , and last thing , put the money in an envelope under the old_woman 's purse there in the drawer . 
she would n't be going_to get that for an hour or_so after person had leave , go do the daily shopping . 
no need leave a note with it , either - or maybe just something like , do n't worry about me , i 'm go_away to make a better life . 
a better life . 
escape . 
it was n't as if she want much . 
she did n't mind work hard , not as if she figure to do anything wrong to live easy and soft - all she want be a chance , where she was n't mark as what she be . 
to be person , and work in a nice shop somewhere , at a_little more money so she could have pretty clothes , and learn lady ' manners and all like that , and get to know different people than up_to_now , not just the ones like her here , with foreign sounding name , the ones go_to the same church and - different place , different job , different people , she 'd be all different too . 
pretty , she 'd do her hair another way ; smart , and wear different kind of clothes - she 'd be person , just what that sound like . 
`` you 've give me the wrong change '' , say the customer sharply . 
`` think i can n't count '' ? 
person make_up the amount in indifferent silence . 
she was listen to other voice , out of the future . 
some of those vaguely imagined new , different people . 
oh , person 's awfully nice , and pretty too , i like person . 
let 's ask person to go_with us , she be always a_lot fun . 
person . 
soon , very soon now & & & . 
person did n't wake until nearly nine thirty . 
it was going_to be another hot day ; already the thermometer stand close_to ninety . 
person be still sound asleep ; he make fresh coffee and search through all the desk drawer for more cigarette before think_of her handbag , and find a crumpled stray cigarette at its bottom , which taste peculiarly of face_powder . 
he leave a note prop on the desk ask her to call him sometime today , and drive home . 
after he 'd get_out fresh liver for bast , he pause to look at her crouch daintily over her dish . 
surely she be just a_trifle fat around the middle ? 
he seem to remember read somewhere that person have large litter , and suffer a dismaying vision of the apartment overrun with a dozen kitten . 
`` y_que_sigue_despues ? 
- what then '' ? he ask her severely . 
`` a lot of people be so peculiar that they do n't like cat , it 's not the easy thing in the world to find good home for kitten - and , damn_it , you know very_well if i have them around long , impossible to give_away them away ! 
and i suppose now that you 've finally grow_up , if a_little late , you 'd go_on produce kitten every six month or_so . 
yes , well , it be a pity to spoil your girlish figure - which all those kitten would do anyway - but i think when you 've raise these we 'll just have the vet fix it so there won n't be any more . 
i wonder if the person would take one . 
and it be no good look at me like that '' , as she wind affectionately around his ankle . 
person 's long nose unexpectedly wrinkle up . 
`` happen to be in the hall ! 
happen to hear you quarrel about her ! 
oh , well , you can n't really blame person . 
she lose her beau to you '' . 
but she was talk of person when she see the black line of the open door ; person remember it clearly . 
person go_on . 
`` i 've got to get busy . 
person 's take to her bed , with the door locked . 
she open it an inch and poke out the key for me to give you . 
here '' - she thrust a bundle of key strung on a thick red cord into person 's hand . 
`` not that there be much use in lock_up the smokehouse and the storehouse now . 
drink your coffee '' - 
coffee . 
`` it be - cold '' . 
person suddenly look quite capable of pour it down her throat . 
`` i do n't want it '' , person say , firmly . 
`` oh . 
well - i 'll take it down with me as i go '' . 
person swoop_up the cup and hike_up her top hoop as if about to take_off with a racing start . 
at the door she turn back , her roman_nose look very long now and satiric . 
`` i forget . 
person and person have go_after them . 
it be just like that book your northern friend write - except there be n't any ice_floe to cross and no bloodhound '' . 
`` i do n't know person . 
what can they do if they find them '' ? 
`` they can n't do anything . 
it be silly , childish , run after them like that . 
i tell person so . 
but of_course the patroller won n't be of any help , not with everything so upset and that yankee cavalry outfit they say is run around , god_knows_where '' . 
she had swish away , she had be gone for a long_time probably when person suddenly realize that she ought_to stop her , pour_out the coffee , so no_one would drink it . 
but_then the so-called coffee be bad enough at_best , cold it be all_but undrinkable - especially that cup ! 
she be deeply , horribly sure that person had fill it with opium . 
she had quarrel with person , she had resist his demand for money - and if she die , by the provision of her marriage_contract , person would inherit legally not_only the immediate sum of gold under the floorboard in the office , but later , when the war be over , her father 's entire estate . 
she feel cold and hot , sticky and chilly at_the_same_time . 
now wait a minute , she tell herself , think_about it ; person be not the only person in this house who could have put opium in that coffee . 
she had lose a bottle of opium - but that be on the trip from new_orleans . 
or someone had take it during her first day at location . 
yes , she had miss it after her talk with person , after dinner , just before person was shoot . 
person or person had enter her room while she sleep , bring back her washed clothes . 
so somebody else could have come_in , too - then or later while she be out of the room . 
it would have be easy to identify as opium by its odor . 
it be not very reasonable to believe that person had procure unprocurable opium and come_back to location with a formed plan to murder her . 
he did n't even know that she be there . 
and he certainly could n't have guess that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she be not the yielding - yes , and credible fool he have every right to expect . 
no , he had been surprise , unpleasantly surprise , but surprise . 
then somebody else ? 
do n't question , person had say , do n't invite danger . 
her skin crawl : person had tell person that she be in the hall and the door be open . 
person had begin to tell person of person , she had begin to question and a little draft had creep across the room from the bedroom door , open barely enough to show a rim of blackness in the hall . 
so person - or anybody - could have listen , and that somebody could have already be supplied_with the missing bottle of opium . 
that be not reasonable either . 
the opium had disappear before person 's death and whoever shoot him could not by any stretch of the imagination have foresee person 's own doubt and suspicion - and question . 
she begin to doubt whether there had be in_fact a lethal_dose of opium in the cup . 
so suppose somebody only wish to frighten her , so she would leave location ! 
that make a certain amount of logic . 
added to the argument be the fact that while she might have taste the coffee if it had be still hot , she might even have drink some of it , she would n't have take enough to kill her , for she would have been warn by its taste . 
no . 
it be merely an attempt to frighten her . 
she would n't go_back to new_york as person suggest ; she would n't run like a scared cat . 
but - well , she 'd be very careful . 
she dress and the accustomed routine restore to her a sense of normal everyday life . 
but before she leave her room she dig_into her big moire bag , take_out the envelope hold her marriage_contract and the wax seal had been break . 
so somebody else know what would happen to her father 's money if she die . 
person had know all_along . 
person did n't need to break the wax seal , read the contract and find_out . 
he could conceivably have wish to make sure ; person love location , it be like a part of his breath and body ; person had stress the need for money . 
person would never have try to give her poison ! 
she thrust the envelope back in the bag ; there be no point in lock_up it up in the armoire now , it be like lock the barn after the horse was steal . 
and in_all_likelihood , by now , there be more than one person in the house who know the term of her marriage_contract . 
there be no point either in tell herself again what a fool she 'd be . 
she go downstairs and receive another curious shock , for when person flap into the dining_room in her homemade moccasins , person ask her when she had bring coffee to her room and person say she had n't . 
`` too much work this morning , person - everybody gone like that '' - 
person swallow past another kind of constriction in her throat . 
`` well , then who bring it '' ? 
`` miss person . 
she come to the kitchen and say she take it up to you '' . 
person put_down a dish of lukewarm rice . 
`` not much breakfast this morning . 
i do n't know what we 're going_to do , person '' . 
`` we 've got to eat '' , person say , curtly , because a chill crawl over her again . 
person ? 
person flap away . 
the rice be n't dosed with opium , indeed it have no taste at_all , not a grain of salt . 
she eat what she could and go_out along the covered passageway , with the rain drip from the vine . 
in the kitchen person was despairingly pick chicken . 
`` get a basket '' , person tell her . 
`` we 'll go_to the storehouse '' . 
person drop a chicken and a flurry of feather , and go with her through the drizzle , to the storehouse . 
person find the right key and unlock the door . 
it be a long , low room , like a root_cellar , for it be bank up with soil , and vine had run rampant over that , too . 
it be dark but dry and cool . 
she doled_out what person vaguely guess be the right amount of dried pea , egg , cornmeal , a little salt . 
the shelf look empty than when person had show her the storeroom , and since the man from the commissary had call ; there be certainly now fewer mouth to feed but there be less to feed them with . 
she take person to the smokehouse , unlock it and see with satisfaction there be still a quantity of ham and side of bacon , hang from the smoke stained rafter . 
they would n't go hungry , not_yet . 
and the field be green and growing . 
`` ca n't you possibly imagine what life is going to be like , here '' ? 
person had say . 
person . 
she send person back to the house , her basket and her apron laden . 
she stand for a moment , rain drip from the tree over her head , think_of person . 
person have the opportunity to take the bottle of opium from person 's room . 
person have the cool ruthlessness to do whatever she make_up_one's_mind up her mind to do . 
she could n't see how her death could affect person . 
she could n't see any reason why person would attempt to frighten her . 
besides , there be something hysterical and silly , something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her . 
person be neither hysterical nor silly and person rather doubt if she had ever be childish . 
yet person had suggest that person return to new_york . 
person could have shoot person - if she 'd have a reason to kill him . 
there be no use in stand there in the drizzle , try to find a link between person 's murder and opium in a cup of coffee . 
she start back for the house , see a light in the office , open the door and surprise a domestic little scene which be far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder . 
person , person and person were mend shoe . 
a lighted lamp stand on the table that dusky , drizzling day . 
they were all three bend over a shabby riding_boot ; person have a tack_hammer . 
person hold a patch of leather , person steady something , a tiny brad , waiting for person 's poised hammer . 
person say , `` first thing i do when i get to location again , be get me a yankee '' - 
`` with boot on '' , person laugh_softly . 
person look up and see her . 
person look up and stiffen . 
person did n't look up at_all . 
there be no way to know , no way to guess whether any one of them be surprised at person 's appearance , believe her to be drugged and senseless - and just possibly dead . 
person say , `` come in , person . 
reckon you know the news '' . 
and what news , person think as satirically as person might have say it . 
person 's face be suddenly a_little fixed and questioning . 
he turn_to person and person . 
`` take your cobbler 's shop somewhere else . 
i want to talk to person '' . 
everything in the office , the spreading circle of lamplight , the patch of leather in person 's hand . 
person poised with the tack_hammer , the homely , everyday atmosphere , all deny an attempt at murder . 
a rush of panic catch person . 
`` no . 
not now . 
i mean i 've got_to - to see to the kitchen . 
person '' - 
her words jumble together and she all_but run from the office and from the question in person 's face . 
now why did i do that ? 
she think as warm , drizzling rain touch her face . 
she be no schoolgirl , refuse to bear tale . 
as she reach the kitchen door the answer present itself ; if she tell anyone of the opium it must be person , her husband . 
it might be , indeed it had already prove to be a marriage without love , but it be marriage . 
so she could n't choose person as a confidant ; it must be person . 
always provided_that person himself had not dose her coffee with opium , she think , as coldly and sharply , again , as person might have say it . 
she pause at the kitchen door , catch_one's_breath her breath , tell herself firmly that the opium be only an attempt to frighten her and go_into the kitchen , where person was eye the chicken dismally and person was clean lamp_chimney . 
person give a gulp . 
`` person , i can n't cut_up no chicken . 
person say she will n't '' . 
again the homely , everyday detail of daily living refute a vicious attempt to frighten her - or to murder her . 
the homely everyday detail of living and domestic requirement also press upon her with their immediate urgency . 
no_matter what had happen or had n't happen , somebody had_to see about dinner . 
she eye the chicken with , if she had know it , something of person 's dismal look and think with a certain fury of the time she had spend on latin verb . 
`` not since last night . 
i did n't think there was any reason to '' . 
`` maybe there is n't . 
speak to him again anyway . 
try talk to some of the fellow he work with , friend , anyone . 
try to find_out how happy he be with his wife , whether he play_around with woman . 
you might try look_into his wife too . 
she might have been talk to some of her friend about her husband if they 've been have any trouble '' . 
`` you think person 's the one we 're look_for '' ? 
`` yeah . 
i think he might be '' , person say grimly . 
`` then_again he might not '' . 
`` what a stinking world '' , person say . 
`` person be person 's best_friend '' . 
`` i know '' . 
`` will you be come_back soon '' ? 
`` i think so . 
i be on_the_way to see the person woman '' . 
`` person 's secretary ? 
what for ? 
you do n't think person be the - '' ? 
`` i do n't think anything . 
i just do n't want to go_off_half_cocked before pick_up person , that be all '' . 
person interrupt . 
`` person say he be in his office all day with her yesterday . 
i 'd like to make sure . 
also , it be just possible she might know something about person '' . 
`` right . 
i 'll see you later '' . 
`` are n't you ever going_to go_home '' ? 
`` it sure_as_hell does n't look like it , does_it ? 
i 'm tell you , if these corpse ever know the trouble they put us to , they 'd think_twice before let themselves get knock_off '' . 
`` remember to tell that to the next corpse you meet '' . 
person hang_up and sit on the small telephone_booth bench , massage his right leg . 
he look at his watch . 
it was ten minute before eleven . 
he wonder how long it would be before they have a signed confession from person . 
thirty year ' experience let him know , even at this early stage , that person be his man . 
but he still want to know why . 
it was a cold , windy day , the day after person 's death , but person pay no attention to the blustery october wind . 
after leave person , person have no destination . 
he simply walk , not notice where he be , not care . 
he stop automatically at the street_corner , wait for the traffic_light to change , unheeding of other people , his coat open and flap . 
as he walk , he try to think . 
of person . 
of himself . 
mainly of what person had try to make him believe . 
there was nothing coherent about his thinking . 
it be a succession of picture image pass through his mind : the same ones , different ones , in no apparent sequence , in no logical succession . 
the enormity of what person had tell him make it impossible for person to accept , with any degree of realism , the actuality of it . 
person 's words have intellectual meaning for him only . 
emotionally , they penetrate him not at_all . 
whoever_he_was and your wife be_intimate . 
person remember person 's exact word . 
they make_sense and yet they did n't . 
he know person had tell him the truth . 
it be so . 
yet it be n't so . 
it be n't so because it could n't be so . 
when person be alive - and he remember the pressure of her hand rest_on lightly on his arm - she had be the center of his life . 
she be the sun , he the closest planet orbiting around her , the rest of the world existing and visible yet removed . 
for fifty-five year he had live , progress towards a no-goal , eat , work , breathe without plan , without reason . 
person had come_along to justify everything . 
she be his goal , she be his reason . 
he had live all his life wait for her . 
not once , in the time that he had know her , had he ever consider the possibility , not once , not for one one-thousandth of a second , of her infidelity . 
he could not consider it now . 
not really . 
and so he walk , aimless again . 
the walk end , inevitably , right in front of his hotel building . 
the doorman begin to nod his head automatically , then remember who person be , what had happen to him the night before . 
he look at person with undisguised curiosity . 
person pass by him without see him . 
he cross the lobby and ride up in the elevator lost in his own thought . 
in the apartment itself , all be still . 
the police be no_longer there . 
there was no evidence that anything be different than it had be . 
except that person be n't there . 
without take_off his coat , he sit in the blue chair which still face the closed bedroom door . 
at_last , sit there , in the familiar surroundings , the truth begin to sink_in . 
who ? 
he feel no anger towards person , no sense that she had betray him . 
who ? 
she be all he have , everything he have , everything he want . 
someone had take_away her away from him . 
who ? 
where there is a left-hand entry in the ledger , there is a right-hand one , he remember from his schooldays . 
where there is a victim , there is a killer . 
who ? 
whoever_he_was and your wife be_intimate . 
he rise from the chair , take_off his coat . 
quickly , he go_into the bedroom . 
the bed still show sign of where person had lie . 
person stand there for a long_time . 
he look at the bed unblinkingly . 
the bed be empty now . 
person would lie in it no_more . 
he would lie in it no_more . 
person wonder whether person had lie in that same bed with & & & who ? 
for thirty minute , person stand there . 
at the end of the half-hour , rack his brain , think_of over_and_over_again of person , her friend , her past , he leave the bedroom . 
who ? 
he could think_of no answer . 
person put_on his coat again . 
before leave , he take_a_look one last , lingering look at the apartment . 
he know he would never see it again . 
in the street , walk as quickly as he could , person be a lone figure . 
on person , person 's death had a quite different effect . 
for person , person 's death be a source of guilty , but nonetheless soaring , happy hope . 
in person 's defense , it must be say she be unaware of the newborn hope . 
if anyone had ask her , she would have describe herself only as nervous and worried . 
the figure on the worksheet paper in_front_of her were jump and wave around so badly it was_all_she_could_do to make_out them out clearly enough to copy them with the typewriter . 
she wonder whether person would call . 
she want to be with him , to give him the comfort and companionship she know he need . 
she had skip her lunch hour in the fear that he might call while she be out . 
he had n't . 
and now she was feel sick , both from concern about person and hunger . 
why had n't he call ? 
man , she reflect , even man like person , be unpredictable . 
she try to think_of his unpredictable action in the eleven year she had know him and discover they be n't so many after_all . 
person really be quite predictable . 
that be one of the thing she like about person . 
he be n't like so many other man . 
the dentist last night , for_instance . 
dinner and the movie had be fine . 
he had take her upstairs to say good_night . 
she had invite him in for coffee . 
it be in the kitchen , as she was watch the kettle , wait for the water to boil , that he had grab for her . 
without warning , without give her a chance to prepare_for it . 
from behind , he had put his arm on her shoulder , turn her around , and press her to him , so close she could n't breathe . 
later , she apologize for the long scratch across his face , try to explain she could n't help herself , that the panic arise in her unwanted . 
but he had n't understand . 
when he leave , she know she would never see him again . 
person be n't like that . 
she could always predict what person was going_to do , ever since she first meet him . 
except for that one morning . 
the morning he walk in to announce to her , blushing , that he be married . 
she think she was going_to die . 
she had assume before then that one day he would ask her to marry him . 
person could n't remember when she had first arrive at this conclusion . 
she think it was sometime during the second week she work for person . 
it was nothing that he say or do , but it seem so natural to her that she should be work for him , look_forward to his eventual proposal . 
she be thirty-one year old then . 
her mother be already considerably concerned over her daughter 's future . 
but person had been able to maintain a serene and assured composure in the face of her widowed mother 's continued carping , had be able to resist her urging to date anyone who offer the slightest possibility of matrimony . 
for person , it was only a matter of time before person would propose . 
it was to_be_expected that person would be shy , slow in take such a momentous step . 
person go_along in life , she know , convinced that he deserve the love and faith of no woman . 
as_a_result , he never look_for it . 
but one day , she expect , he would somehow discover , without her having_to tell him , that there was such a woman in the world ; a woman who be willing to give him love , faith , and anything else a woman could give a husband . 
indeed , there was a woman who , unasked , had already give him love . 
unquestionably , person love person . 
and_then , unexpectedly , person made his announcement . 
on that first day , person literally think she was going_to die , or , at_the_least the very least , go out of her mind . 
it might have be easy for her if person had n't be everything that person be not . 
person be thirty year young than person , tall than person , pretty than person have any right to hope for , much_less expect . 
person could have marry a score of man . 
there was no reason for her to marry someone like person , there was no need for her to marry person . 
person had come into the office , on somebody 's recommendation , because she need help in prepare her income_tax_return . 
person had fill_out the return and because , when he be finished , it was close to the lunch hour , he had politely ask person to join him , never expect her to accept . 
person know all this because the door to person 's office be open and , without strain too hard , she could hear everything that was say . 
person had go_out , say he would be back in an hour . 
he had n't come_back for over two . 
after that day , person still did n't know exactly what had happen . 
there were morning when person come_in late , afternoon when he leave early , day when he did n't come_in at_all . 
person know something must be cause person 's new , strange behavior but she never once connect it with person . 
it be too unprecedented . 
then , six week after the day person first come into the office , person announce he and person be married . 
somehow , person manage to cover the stunned surprise and offer her congratulation . 
that night the two of them leave for a week 's honeymoon in acapulco . 
while they be away person come into the office every morning , run thing as she had always run them for person , go_through the week in a dazed stupor , get thing done automatically , out of habit . 
for exactly one week , she be able to continue in this manner . 
on the morning of person 's return , however , her strength leave her . 
two hour of watch his serenely happy face , listen to his soft humming as he bend over his penciled figure , and person had_to leave . 
she stay away for ten day . 
those ten day be like no others that person had know . 
mostly , she stay in bed . 
she did n't tell anyone , even her mother , what be wrong . 
she refuse to have a doctor , insist there was nothing a doctor could do for her . 
his son watch until he get as far as the hall , almost out_of_sight , then hurry after . 
`` dad . 
dad , wait '' . 
he catch_up_with the old_man in the living_room . 
person had put_down the suitcase to open the front_door . 
`` just this one favor , dad . 
just do n't tell person that crazy opinion of yours '' . 
`` why not '' ? 
the old_man give the room a stare in leave ; under the scraggly brow the pale old eye burn with a bitter memory . 
`` it be the truth '' . 
`` the person girl was kill by person 's son . 
person and person have be across the street , talk to the kid . 
they 've find some sort of new evidence , a bundle of clothes or something , and it must link the kid even strongly to the crime . 
why won n't you accept fact ? 
the two kid be together a_lot , they were have some kind of teenage affair - god_knows how far that had go - and the kid 's crippled . 
he limp , and the man who hit you and take the cane , he limp . 
my_god , how much more do you want '' ? 
his father look him over closely . 
`` you sound like an old_woman . 
you should have go_to work today , ' stead of sneak around spy on the person house '' . 
`` now , see_here '' - 
`` the trouble with you '' , person begin , and then check himself . 
person had open the oven and there was a drifting odor of hot biscuit . 
the old_man open the door and step out into the sunlight . 
`` is n't enough time to go into it '' , he finish , and slam the door in his son 's face . 
person turn from the window drapery . 
`` they find something else up there '' , she say half aloud to the empty room . 
`` they take_away it away , overall or something '' . 
she walk restlessly across the room , then back to the window . 
`` now they 've go , they did n't come_back , and they did n't arrest that person boy '' . 
she stand frown and chew her lip . 
she was wear a brown cotton dress , cut across the hip in a way that be supposed to make her look slim , a yoke set into the skirt and flaring pleat below . 
she smooth the skirt , sit_down , then stand_up and go_back to the window . 
`` why on_earth did i send him off to work ? 
there was excuse enough to keep him home , that young person 's still over there '' . 
with sudden energy , she go to the phone and ring person 's office and ask for him . 
`` i think you had_better come home '' . 
`` person , we be so busy . 
person 's been_on_everybody 's_neck , an order he expect did n't come_through and he 's '' - 
`` i do n't care . 
i want you here . 
i be all alone and certain thing are go_on that look very ominous . 
i need someone to go_out and find_out what 's happen '' . 
`` but i could n't do that , even if i be home '' ! 
his voice grow high and trembling . 
`` i can n't be underfoot every time those cop turn_around ! 
they 'll think i do something '' . 
he could n't see the grin that split her mouth ; the tooth that shine into the phone be like a shark 's . 
`` you 'll just have to risk it . 
you can n't wander along in the dark , can you ? 
i 'd think that you , even more_than i , would be wonder what they be up_to . 
they find some clothes '' , she . 
`` what '' ? 
deliberately , she ignore the yelp . 
`` also , that person be here . 
i guess he want to ask you some question . 
i stall him off . 
he does n't expect you until five '' . 
`` then i 'd better wait until five '' . 
`` no . 
come home right_away '' . 
she slap the receiver into its holder and step away . 
her eye be bright with anticipation . 
in his office , person replace the phone slowly . 
he rise from his chair . 
he have to cough then ; he go to the window and choke there with the fresh breeze on his face . 
he get his hat out of the closet . 
for a moment he think_of go_into person 's office to explain that he have to leave , but there was now such a pain in his chest , such a pounding in his head , that he decide to let_go it go . 
he pass the receptionist in the outer office , mutter , `` i 've got to go_out for a little while '' . 
let her call person if she want to , let person raise_the_roof or even can him , he did n't care . 
he get_into the car . 
put the key into the switch , press the accelerator with his foot , put the car into reverse , seem vast endeavor almost beyond the ability of his shaking body . 
once out in the street , the traffic be a gadfly maze in which he wander stricken . 
when he turn into the highway that lead to the outskirts of the city and then rise toward home , he have to pull over to the curb and wait for a_few minute , suck_in air and squint and blink his eye to clear them of tear . 
what on_earth be in person 's mind , that she want him up there spy on what the cop were do ? 
what did she think he could do ? 
he try to ignore what his own common_sense tell him , but it be n't possible ; her motive be too blatant . 
she want him to get_into trouble . 
she want the police to notice him , suspect him . 
she was going to keep_on scheme , poke , prod , suggest , and dictate until the cop get_up enough interest in him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask question . 
and he know in that moment , with a cold sinking of despair , a dying of old hope , that person had spread some kind of word there among the neighbor . 
nothing bald , open ; but enough . 
they 'd have some suspicion to repeat to the police . 
though his inner thought cringe at it , he force himself to think_back , recreate the scene in which person claim to have catch him molest the child . 
it had n't amount to anything . 
there had been nothing evil or dirty in his intention . 
a second scene flash before his mind , the interior of the garage at the new house and the young person girl turn startled to meet him , the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then the brightness as person had click on the light . 
suppose the cop somehow get hold of that ? 
well , it had n't be what it seem , he 'd have no idea the girl be in there . 
he had n't touch her . 
and when he come to examine the scene , there was a certain staginess to it , it have the smell of planning , and a swift suspicion dart into his mind . 
too monstrous , of_course . 
person would n't have plot a thing like that . 
it was just that little accident played_into_her_hands . 
like this murder . 
he lean_on the wheel , clutch it , stare into the sunlight , and try to bring order into his thought . 
he feel light-headed and sick . 
there was no use wander off into a territory of utter nightmare . 
person be his wife . 
she be married to him for better or for worse . 
she would n't be wilfully plan his destruction . 
but she was . 
she was . 
even as the conviction of truth roar through him , shatter his last hope of safety , he was reach to release the hand_brake , to head up the road for home , do her bidding . 
he drive , and the road wobble , familiar scene creep past on either side . 
he come to a stretch of old orange grove , the tree dead , some of them uproot , and then there was an outlying shopping area , and tract house . 
he have the feeling that he should abandon the car and run_off somewhere to hide . 
but he could n't imagine where . 
there was really no place to go , finally , except home to person . 
at the gate he slow , look_around . 
person be beside his car , on the curb at the right , just stand there morosely ; he did n't even look up . 
behind him on the steps of the little office sit person ; he be straight , something angry in his attitude , as if he might be wait to report something . 
person step_on the gas . 
a new idea drift in from_nowhere . 
he could go_to the police . 
he could tell them his fear of be involved , he could explain what had happen in the old neighborhood and how person had misunderstand and how she had hold_over it over him - the scene be complete in his mind at the moment , even to his own jerking and sniveling , and person 's silent patience . 
he could throw himself on the mercy of the police_department . 
it be n't what person would want him to do , though . 
he be sure of this . 
once he had abandon himself to the very worst , once he had quiet all the dragon of worry and suspense , there would n't be very much for person to do . 
at that moment , person almost slam on the brakes to go_back to person and ask if person be about . 
it would be such a relief . 
what be that old sign , supposed to be painted over a door somewhere , abandon hope , all ye who enter here ? 
why , person say to himself , surprised at his own sudden insight , i 'll bet some of those people who enter be just as happy as can be . 
they 've worry , they 've lie_awake night , they 've shake at the slightest footstep , they 've picture their own destruction , and now it be all over and they can give_up . 
sure , they 're give_up hope . 
hand_in_hand with hope go_with thing like terror and apprehension . 
good-bye . 
person wave a hand at the empty street . 
glad to see you go . 
he drive into the paved space before the garage and get_out , slam the car_door . 
he look up and down the street . 
if person 's car had be in_sight , person would have walk directly to it . 
he go to the front_door and open it and look in . 
person enter the room from the hallway to the kitchen . 
she have a cup of something steam , coffee perhaps , in one hand , a fresh piece of toast in the other . 
she stand there , watch person come_in , and she put the piece of toast in her mouth and bite_off one corner with a huge chomp of her white tooth . 
`` person '' - 
`` i 've been think '' , she say , swallow the toast . 
`` did n't you have an old pair of painting overall in the garage ? 
you use them that time you paint the porch at our other house . 
and then you wipe_up some grease '' . 
she had catch him off_guard , no preparation , nothing certain but that ahead lie some kind of disaster . 
`` no . 
wait a minute . 
what do you '' - 
`` i 've been look_for them , and they be gone . 
i be sure they be in the garage up until a_couple_of day ago . 
or even yesterday . 
you used to paint in them , and then you just take them for rag . 
the police have them now '' . 
`` i do n't remember any overall at_all '' . 
`` they be all faded . 
worn through at the knee '' . 
she stand sip and chew and watch . 
`` green paint , be n't it ? 
well , i be not sure of the color . 
but you have them '' . 
`` person , sit_down . 
put_down the cup of coffee . 
tell me what this be all about '' . 
she shake her head . 
she took another bite of toast . 
person notice almost absently how she chew , how the whole side of her cheek move , a slab of fat that extend down into her neck . 
`` my_goodness , you ought to remember if i do . 
you 're going_to have to go to the police and explain what happen . 
tell them the truth , or something , before they come here '' . 
a seeping coldness enter person 's being ; his nerve seem frostbitten down to the tip of his tingling finger and his spine feel stiff and glass like , liable to break like an icicle at any moment . 
`` i 've never own any painting overall . 
a man with a sketch_pad in hand sit with a large pink woman in a small office at the end of a long , dim corridor and make pencil line on_paper and say , `` is this more like it , person ? 
or are the eyebrow more like this '' ? 
when he had finish with that , he would go_to another part of the hotel and say much the same thing to someone else , most probably a busboy . 
`` begin to look_like him now , would you say ? 
different about the mouth , huh ? 
more like this , maybe '' ? 
man blow dust on object in a room on the seventeenth floor of the location and blow it off again , and do the same in a tiny , almost airless room in a tenement in the location . 
and man also use vacuum_cleaner in both room , suck dust up once_more . 
man from the third_detective_district , location , have the long , the most tedious , job . 
at the location there had , at the time at_issue , been twenty-three overnighter , count couple as singular . 
these include , as one , person and person , who had check_in a little after noon the day before , and had not check_out together . 
but person was not include ; he had be at the location for almost a week . 
there be , of_course , no special reason to believe that the man or woman they seek had stay only overnight at the hotel . 
the twenty-three ( or twenty-two with the person themselves omit ) provide merely a place to start , and their identification be the bare of start . 
with name and address listed , verification come next . 
it would take time ; it would , almost inevitably , trouble_some_water . 
( `` i certainly be not at the location last night and my husband could n't have be . 
he be in boston . 
of_course he be in '' - ) 
the location across the street provide almost twice as_many problem . 
the location offer respectable and convenient lodgings to people from the suburb who want to see a show and did n't want - heaven_knew did n't want ! 
- to lunge anxiously through crowded street to railroad_station and , at odd hours of night , drive from smaller railroad_station to distant home , probably through rain or , in november , something worse . 
the location be less expensive than the location . 
the location have fifty-four overnighter , again count room rather than people . 
check_out the overnighter out . 
fail to find what was want , as be most likely , check_out other guest , with special - but not exclusive - attention to those with room on the street . 
( anyone active enough can reach a roof , wherever his room may be . ) 
and know , while all this go_on , that there be no real reason to suppose that the murderer had be a guest in either hotel . 
it be not even certain the shot had been fire from either hotel . 
there be other roof , less convenient but not impossible . 
it be dull business , detecting , and hard on foot . 
there was also the one salient question to ask , and ask widely : did you notice anything out-of-the-way ? 
like , for_example , a man carry a twenty-two_rifle , probably with a telescopic_sight attached ? 
there was , of_course , no hope it really would be that simple . 
the sniper , whether psychopathic marksman or murderer by intent , would hardly have walk to his vantage_point with rifle over shoulder , whistle a marching tune . 
anybody carry anything that might hide a rifle ? 
long thin suitcase ? 
or long fat suitcase , for_that_matter ? 
shrug meet that , from room_clerk , from bellhop . 
who measure ? 
but nothing , it appear , long enough to attract attention . 
case , say , for musical_instrument ? 
none note at the location . 
several at the location . 
a combo was stay there . 
and had been for a week . 
anything else ? 
anything at all ? 
shrug meet that . 
( person , location , think for a time he might be_on_to_something . 
a refuse bin at the location turn_up a florist 's box - a very long box for very long stemmed flower . 
trace of oil on green tissue ? 
the lab to check . 
the lab : sorry . 
no oil . ) 
anything at all strange ? 
well , a man had try , at the location , to register with an ocelot . 
at the location , a guest had come in a collapsible wheelchair . 
at the location one guest had have his head heavily bandaged , and another have a bandaged foot and had walk with crutch . 
there had also been a man who must have have st._vitus or something , because he keep jerk his head . 
as report dribble in , person toss them into the centrifuge which had become his head . 
person come_in . 
there was no sign of person at her house on location , location , connecticut . 
the house be modern , large , on five acre . 
must have cost plenty . 
the state cop would check from_time_to_time ; pass word when there was word to pass . 
person toss this news into the centrifuge . 
sort_out thing out , damn_it . 
sort_out the next move . 
try to forget motive for_the_moment . 
consider opportunity . 
only those actually with person when he was shoot , or who had leave the party within not more_than five minute ( make five arbitrary ) positively have none . 
the person ; person , person 's publicity director ; person , producer of uprising . 
they had be with person when he was shoot , could not therefore have shoot him from above . 
take person . 
he had leave after the scuffle ; had been see to leave . 
he would have have ample time to go_into a blind somewhere and wait his prey . 
consider him seriously , therefore ? 
intangible enter , then - hunch which feel like fact . 
person would ambush , certainly ; person undoubtedly had . 
person be , presumably , a better than average shot . 
but - hunch , now - person would not ambush anything which go on two leg instead of four . 
because , if for no other reason , person would never for a moment suppose he be not bigger , tough , than anything else that go on two leg . 
ambush are lay by those who doubt themselves , as any man may against a tiger . 
person had had to `` go_on '' from the party and had , presumably , gone_on . 
to be check_out further . 
forget motive ? 
no , motive be a part of fact . 
nobody in_his_right_mind punish a quarter-century old dereliction . 
grudge simply do not keep that well in a sane mind . 
person had accomplish much in a quarter-century of a century . 
jeopardize it now to correct so old a wrong ? 
person shake his head . 
also , he think , i doubt if she could hit the side of a barn with a shotgun . 
person herself ? 
she had leave the party early , plead a headache . 
no lack of opportunity , presume she have a gun . 
she might , conceivably , have bring one in in a large enough suitcase . 
( check on the person luggage . ) 
she might now have take_away it away again . 
motive - her husband wander ? 
bitter , unreasoning jealousy ? 
heaven know it happen and hell know it too . 
but - it happen , almost always , among the primitive and , usually , among the very young . 
( call it mentally young ; call it retarded . ) 
there was nothing to indicate that person be primitive . 
she did not move in primitive circle . 
she be young , but not that young . 
it occur to person that he was , on a hunch basis , eliminate a good many . 
he remind himself that all elimination be tentative . 
he also remind himself that he have an unusual number of possibility . 
the person , mother or son , or mother and son ? 
opportunity be obvious . 
motive . 
here , too , the cause to hate lie well back in the year . 
but bitterness have more cause to remain , even increasingly to corrode . 
with the boy , particularly . 
the boy had , apparently - if person be right in what she had tell person - only in recent month been force to give_up college , to work as a busboy . 
see the man he blame for this made_much_of - youth and bitterness and - 
person pick_up the telephone ; get person . 
`` send_out a pickup on person and the boy when you 've get enough to go_on '' , person say . 
`` right '' ? 
person would do . 
a man named person , playwright director , had express a wish that person drop_dead . 
he would say , of_course , that he had not really have any such wish ; that what he had say be no more than one of those thing one does say , lightly , mean nothing . 
which probably would turn_out to be true ; which he obviously had to be give the opportunity to say . 
a man named person , with `` y '' and `` e '' but pronounce without them , had been fire at person 's insistence . 
he be also , if person be right , a close acquaintance of person 's than she , now , was incline to admit . 
he might deny the latter ; would certainly deny any connection between the two thing , or any connection of either with murder . 
he would have to be give the opportunity . 
person ? 
it be evident that person be the man to go . 
it be evident that a captain should remain at his desk , direct with a firm hand and keep a firm seat . 
person be good_and_tired of the wall opposite , and the crack in the plaster . 
let person keep the firm seat ; let person . 
when siamese_cat be intertwine it is difficult to tell where one leave_off and another begin . 
stilts and shadow , on person 's bed , appear to be one cat - rather large , as siamese_cat go , and , to_be_sure , have two head and two tail . 
on_the_other_hand , they , or it , seem to have no leg whatever . 
person say , `` hi '' , to her cat , and add that proper cat meet their human at the door . 
of four dark brown ear , one twitch slightly at this . 
`` all_right '' , person say . 
`` i know it is n't dinnertime '' . 
but at this the one too_large cat suddenly become two cat , stretch . 
shadow , the more talkative , begin at_once to talk , her voice piteous . 
stilts , a more direct cat , leap from the bed and trot briskly toward the kitchen . 
shadow look surprised , wail , and trot after her . 
the hell it is n't dinnertime , two waving tail tell person . 
it was not , whatever tale was tell by tail . 
person presumably would cope . 
she might be firm . 
it was most unlikely that she would be firm . 
they want to be fat cat , person think , and light a cigarette and lean_back on a chaise and consider pull_together her thought together . 
after a time , it occur to her that her thought be not worth the trouble . 
a vague feeling that person had had_it_coming be hardly a thought and be , in_any_event , reprehensible . 
had person 's explanation of her confidence , so uninvited , be a_little thin ? 
that be more like a thought , but not a great_deal more . 
had that tall dark boy , carry tray too heavy for him , find what he might have consider adulation of a man he probably hate more_than he could bear ? 
and possess himself - how ? 
- of a rifle and kill ? 
person find she have no answer ; have only a hope . 
the poor kid - the poor , frail kid . 
some people have luck and some have no luck and that , whatever people who prefer order say , be the size_of_it . 
the poor , unlucky - 
the telephone ring . 
person realize , to her surprise , that she had been almost doze . 
at four o'clock in the afternoon . 
two martini for lunch - that be the trouble . 
i ought to remember . 
do n't pretend . 
you do remember . 
you just - `` hello ? 
yes , this be she ? 
what '' ? 
the voice have music in it . 
even with word come too fast , they come on the music of the voice . 
`` i say i would '' , person say . 
`` they won n't talk_about who give the information . 
not unless they have to . 
they do n't , person . 
not unless they have '' - 
she was interrupt . 
`` call this a cry for help '' , person say . 
`` through a door conveniently unlocked '' , person supplement . 
`` that damn door '' , say the police_chief . 
`` a gift_horse to be view with suspicion '' . 
person 's dark face wear a meditative look . 
`` if there be collusion between an outside murderer and a member of the household it would be an elementary precaution to check on the door later . 
and it make a very poor red_herring for an inside_job . 
much better to break a cellar window '' . 
`` do n't forget , there be the hope it would pass for a natural death '' , person remind him . 
`` well , with a house as big as that there must be at_least one cellar window that would n't be notice right_away unless there was a police_investigation '' . 
`` yeah . 
and a pane_of_glass be n't hard to '' - 
the telephone interrupt him . 
he scoop_up the receiver and say , `` police_chief '' , into the mouthpiece , and then , `` oh yes , person . 
i was hope i 'd hear from you today '' . 
with his free hand he pull a pad and pencil toward him and begin to make note as he listen , say , `` uh-huh '' and `` i see '' at interval . 
at_last he say , `` well , thank_you for call , person . 
although there be no doubt in my mind and we 've been handle it as one i be glad to have it make official '' . 
he hang_up . 
`` coroner '' , he say to person . 
`` he 's just hear from the pathologist who say person apparently die from suffocation '' . 
person look at his note . 
`` many minute hemorrhage in the lung ; particle of lint and thread in the mouth and nostrils . 
scraping from the bed_linen identical with the lint and thread find in the nasal_cavity and oral_cavity . 
no other cause of death apparent . 
trachea clear of mucus and foreign object . 
brain examine for thrombosis , clot or hemorrhage . 
no sign of these , no gross hemorrhage of lung , heart , brain or stomach '' . 
he pause . 
`` that 's_about_it . 
oh , the time of death . 
the duration of the digestive process vary , the pathologist say , but the empty stomach and the finding in the upper gastrointestinal tract indicate that person die several hour after her seven o'clock dinner . 
probably around midnight , give_or_take an hour either way '' . 
person pause again . 
`` so there it be '' , he say . 
`` not your problem , of_course , unless person and the murderer be one_and_the_same '' . 
they discuss this possibility . 
however likely it be , person say , he could n't limit himself to it . 
he have to look_for other prospect , other motive until more conclusive evidence point to person come to light . 
person , with his investigation center_on the fraud , say that tomorrow he would go_to the_bronx bank through which person 's check to person had clear . 
person had to be locate , they agree . 
he might have be in collusion with person on the fraud ; he might be person 's murderer or have play some part in her death . 
this be person 's suggestion ; the police_chief shake his head over it . 
if person be involved in the fraud or the murder , then he too have another identity . 
no one the location police had question profess to know any more about him than about person . 
scholarship applicant ? 
person look doubtful . 
person explain that he was think_of an application send directly to person . 
then he ask to use the phone and call person , who say that he was just leave to keep a lunch date but would be home by two o ' o'clock . 
person say that he would see him at two and made another call , this one to person 's lawyer . 
person be out for the day , but person would be free at one-thirty . 
the secretary 's tone indicate that an appointment at such short notice be a concession for which person should be duly grateful . 
he infer that person and person be high-priced lawyer . 
he have lunch with person . 
promptly at one-thirty he enter person and person 's elegant suite of office in person 's new professional building . 
he dislike person on sight , conservative clothes and haircut , smile a shade too earnestly boyish for a man who must be well into his thirties , handclasp too consciously quick and firm . 
youngish man on_the_make , person label him , and be ready to guess that in a correct , not too pushing fashion , the junior partner of the firm have political ambition ; that person would be impeccably suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer ; that there be three child , two boy and a girl ; that she be active in the woman 's club and he in lions , rotary_club , and jaycee ; and finally , that neither of them had harbor an unorthodox opinion since their wedding_day . 
person know that he could be completely wrong about all this , but also know that he would go_on right on dislike person . 
person be prepared to be helpful in what he refer to with fastidious distaste as this unfortunate person affair , which would not , he say more than once , have ever come_about if person had only see fit to consult person or him about it . 
person regret not being able to find_fault_with so true a statement . 
he ask to see a copy of person 's will . 
person bring one out . 
the date , october 8 , 1957 , immediately catch the inspector 's eye . 
`` fairly recent '' , he remark . 
`` be she in the habit of make new will '' ? 
`` oh no . 
she have reason to change the one she make right after person 's death . 
her estate had grow considerably . 
she want to make a more equitable distribution of it among the group that would benefit the most ; particularly the scholarship fund . 
at the time the will was draw person mention to me how mentally alert she seem for her age , know just what change she want make and_so_forth '' . 
person hesitate . 
`` person and i have notice some lapse since , though . 
most_of them this past year , i 'd say . 
even two or three year ago i doubt that she 'd have become involved in this unfortunate person affair . 
she 'd have consult us , you see . 
she always did before , and show the utmost confidence in whatever we advise '' . 
the inspector nod , doubt this . 
person had n't strike him as ready to seek anyone 's advice , least_of_all person 's . 
with her sharp_tongue she 'd have cut_to_ribbons his pompousness to ribbons . 
it would have be person who handle her affairs . 
person settle back to read the will . 
he skim_over the millions that go to location , group , the civic_center , the group , the library , and_so_on , pause when he come to the scholarship fund . 
two millions were add to what had been set_aside for it in person 's lifetime , and the proviso make that as long as person continue to discharge his duty as administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the board_of_trustees ( hereinafter appoint by the bank administer the estate ) he was to be retain in his present capacity at a salary commensurate with the increased responsibility enlargement of the fund would entail . 
a splendid vote_of_confidence in person , person reflect . 
tenure , too . 
very nice for him . 
he go_on to personal bequest , a list of name largely unknown to him . 
twenty-five_thousand to each of the great-niece in oregon ( not much to blood_relative out of millions ) ten_thousand to this friend and that , five_thousand to another ; to person , the sum of ten_thousand dollar ; to the person , ten_thousand each ; to person the conditional bequest of ten_thousand to be pay to her in the event that she be still in person 's employ at the time of the latter 's death . 
( no additional five_thousand for each year after person 's twenty-first birthday ; person had n't get_around_to take_care of that . ) 
too_bad , person think . 
person had earn the larger bequest . 
person was leave twenty_thousand , person ten_thousand . 
there be no other name person recognize . 
person 's might well have been include , he feel . 
person had spend a small_fortune on a search for him but had make no provision for him in her will if he should be find after her death , and had never mention his name to her lawyer . 
person take_up this point with person , who shrug_off it off . 
`` old people have their idiosyncrasy '' . 
`` this one come a_bit high at thirty_thousand or more '' . 
`` well , she have a number of them where money was concern '' , person say . 
`` sometimes we 'd have trouble persuade her to make tax-exempt charitable contribution , and i 've know her to quarrel with a plumber over a bill for fix a faucet ; the next moment she 'd put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty_thousand into something as impractical as this unfortunate person affair . 
there was no tell how she 'd react to spend money '' . 
person inquire next about the audit of the scholarship fund . 
there was an annual audit , person inform him . 
no discrepancy or shortage had ever been find . 
person be a thoroughly honest and competent administrator . 
his salary had reach the ten_thousand mark . 
his expense run another four or five_thousand . 
the lawyer did n't know him very well although he see him occasionally at some dinner_party - person , like himself , person reflect , be the extra man so prize by hostess - and find him easy enough to talk to . 
but he did n't play golf , did n't seem to belong_to any local club - his work take him away a_lot , of_course - which probably account_for his tendency to keep_to_oneself . 
person 's glance begin to flicker to his watch . 
he say that he had already tell the police_chief that he did n't know what insurance man had recommend person to person . 
he would offer no theory to account_for her murder . 
the whole_thing , his manner convey , be so far outside the normal routine of person and person that it practically demand being sweep_under_the_rug . 
no_doubt person had snub him many_a time and he feel no grief over her passing . 
even_so , person 's dislike of the suave , correct lawyer deepen . 
it would be all_right with him , he decide , if his investigation of the fraud , with its probable by-product of murder , lead to person 's door . 
motive ? 
ten-thousand-dollar bequest . 
at_first_glance , not much of a motive for a man of his standing ; but for all his air of affluence , who could tell what his private financial picture be ? 
the inspector know as he leave that this be wishful_thinking . 
nevertheless , he make a mental note to look_into person 's financial background . 
person have a downtown address . 
he live in an apartment_house not over three or four year old , a reclaimed island of landscaped brick and glass on the fringe of the business_district . 
he occupy a two bedroom apartment on the fourth floor , use the second bedroom as his office . 
airy and bright , the apartment was furnish with good modern furniture , rug , and drapery . 
do by a professional decorator , person think , and somehow as impersonal , as unremarkable as its occupant . 
in location the rent would run close_to two_hundred a month ; in location , perhaps twenty-five less , not all_of it pay by person , who could charge off one room on his expense_account . 
he take person into the room he use as an office . 
it contain a desk , file , a typewriter on a stand , and two big leather armchair . 
a newspaper open at stock_market report lie on one of them . 
person fold_up it up and offer a drink . 
the inspector decline . 
to begin the interview , he ask if person , with more time to think_over it over , could add to what he had say the other day about person . 
person shake his head . 
`` it be all i think_about , too . 
that and her death . 
it be still unbelievable that it be murder . 
for all her domineering way , i can n't conceive_of her having have a deadly enemy '' . 
`` dammit , person , are you try to wreck my career ? 
because that be what you 're do - wreck it , wreck it , wreck it '' ! 
person had confront person on the building 's front steps - person had been permit no far - and back him against a wrought_iron railing . 
his rage had build_up as he make_one's_way his way here from the second floor , help by the quantity of champagne he had consume . 
person say , `` i did n't send_for you , person . 
i want the captain in_charge . 
where be he '' ? 
`` person , for god 's sake , go_away . 
the undersecretary 's in there . 
i tell you there be nothing between person and me , nothing . 
it be all in your mind '' . 
a_couple_of sob escape him , follow by a sentiment that reveal his emotional_state . 
`` why , i be not fit to touch the hem of her garment '' . 
`` person , get_a_grip_on yourself . 
it be not about you or person . 
i have some security information about the prime_minister '' . 
person look at him suspiciously through red-rimmed eye . 
`` not about me ? 
you mean it , person ? 
you would n't pull_the_leg_of my leg , old_man ? 
i did get you on the platform this morning '' . 
`` i 'm not pull_the_leg_of your leg . 
will you call that captain '' ? 
`` no use , he won n't come '' . 
he peer closely at person in the gathering darkness . 
`` what happen to your head '' ? 
`` i was hit - knock_out . 
now will you get him '' ? 
`` he say i 'm to take the message '' . 
he stare at person drunkenly . 
`` who 'd hit you in the head '' ? 
`` it does n't matter . 
you get_back to the captain and tell him this : somebody 's going_to take a shot at the prime_minister , and person be in_on the plot . 
tell him under no circumstance to trust the prime_minister with person '' . 
person say , `` that be impossible . 
person be the ambassador '' . 
`` nevertheless it be true '' . 
`` impossible '' . 
person was try to clear his head of the champagne fuzz that encase it . 
`` i 'll show you how wrong you be . 
person and the prime_minister be alone right now '' . 
he nod triumphantly . 
`` so that prove it '' ! 
person look terrified . 
`` where be they '' ? 
`` where 'd you expect , the john ? 
person 's office '' . 
`` where be that '' ? 
`` face us , two flight up . 
look , old_man , you can n't go_up . 
they won n't even let you in the front_door . 
so why do n't you be a good boy and '' - 
person grab him by the shoulder . 
`` listen to me , person . 
if you want to spend another day in the state_department - another day - you get_in there and tell that captain what i tell you '' . 
he bite_out the words . 
`` and you know i can do it '' . 
person raise placating hand . 
`` easy_does_it , person . 
i was just go . 
i be on my way '' . 
he turn and flee into the house and make_one's_way his way up the marble stairs without once look_back . 
on the second landing he pause to look_for person , did n't see him , and accept a glass of champagne . 
he take several large swallow , recollect that person had go_up another flight , and decide he would be wise to cover himself by find him . 
the way person be , no tell what he might say or do . 
he finish his champagne and climb uncertainly to the next landing . 
at the top a uniformed officer block further progress . 
`` yes , what is it '' ? 
he ask . 
`` i want person '' . 
he spot person come_out of a room at the far end of the corridor and call to him . 
person say , `` it 's okay , person , let him by '' . 
they walk toward each other . 
`` well '' ? 
person say , `` person tell me to tell you '' - he wait until they be close ; it be hideously embarrassing - `` not to let the prime_minister be alone with person '' . 
person look half crocked to the captain ; it would be just like him . 
`` why not '' ? 
`` he claim person be in a plot to kill the pm . '' . 
person go taut : be it possible ? 
could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime_minister fear ? 
not possible , he think ; the prime_minister know who his enemy be here ; he was n't going_to allow himself to be lead meekly to the slaughter . 
and if by some wild chance person be the man , he would n't dare try anything now - not after person had look_into on the two of them to see that all be well . 
person be damned if he would make a fool of himself again the way he had earlier over the laundry_truck . 
one more muddleheaded play like that one and they 'd be lead him away . 
still , this had to be check_out . 
`` where 'd your friend person get his information '' ? 
he ask . 
`` have n't the faint , captain '' . 
`` would you mind send him up_here ? 
i 'd like to talk to him '' . 
troubled , he continue along the corridor , poke his head into the next office for a careful look around . 
but person had not stay_on the front steps when person disappear into the building . 
he be unwilling to rely_on person 's carry his message , and he have no confidence the police would act_on it . 
if person be alone with the prime_minister he could be arrange his execution while person stand out here shiver in the darkening street . 
he would have to do something on_his_own . 
but what ? 
the door open and three man and a woman in a sari sweep past him and down_the_stairs . 
in the lighted interior he see other man and woman struggle into their wrap . 
these be the early departure ; in half an hour the reception would be over . 
if person was plan to set_up the prime_minister for person he would have to do it in the next few minute . 
person descend the stone steps to the street and look up at the building . 
wide window with many small leaded pane sweep across the upper story . 
on the second floor he see the animated face of the party guest ; the scene look_like a christmas_card . 
on the third floor one of the two window be lighted ; it be framed in maroon drape , and no face be visible . 
this would be person 's office . 
he and the prime_minister would be back from the window , seated at person 's desk ; they would be go_over papers person had save as excuse for just such a meeting . 
in a minute , or five minute , the business would be done ; person would stand_up , the prime_minister would follow . 
person would direct the prime_minister 's attention to something out the window and would guide him forward and_then step to one side . 
the single shot would come ; person would carry its sound to his grave . 
person , of_course , would be desolate . 
how was he to suspect that an assassin had been lurk somewhere across the street wait for just such a chance ? 
person turn . 
where across the street ? 
where was person wait with the rifle ? 
narrow four story building run the length of the block like book tightly pack on a shelf . 
most_of them could be eliminate ; person 's would have to be one of the half_dozen almost directly opposite . 
the legation was generously set back from the building line ; if the angle of fire be too great the jutting building on either side would interfere . 
would the shot come from a roof ? 
he run his eye along the roof coping ; almost at_once a figure bulk up . 
but dully glint on the dark form were the button and badge of a policeman . 
with a cop patrol the road person would have to be inside a building - if he be here at_all , and not wait for the prime_minister somewhere between this street and the terminal building at location . 
person cross the narrow street , squeeze between parked car to reach the sidewalk . 
from this side he could see far into the legation 's third story window , but he see no face ; the room 's occupant be still seat or they had been call into the hallway by an alarmed police_captain . 
if only the latter be true . 
he walk rapidly along the building scan their facade : one be a club - that be out ; two other he rule_out because all their window be lighted . 
that leave three , possibly four , one look much like the next . 
he climb the steps of the first and open the door to the vestibule . 
he quickly close it again . 
he had assume that all these building had been divide into apartment , but this one , from a glance at the hall furnishings , be obviously still a functioning town_house , and its owner be in residence ; that make it doubtful as the hiding_place of a man whose plan had to be make in_advance . 
he go_on to the next building and find what he expect - the mingle cooking aroma of a public vestibule . 
on one wall be the brass front of a row of mailbox ; there were six apartment . 
now what ? 
the name on the mailbox mean nothing to him . 
this be senseless - he have no idea what to look_for . 
he peer in the mailbox themselves ; all be empty except one , and that one be jammed with letter and magazine . 
the occupant of apartment number 3 be probably away for a_few day , and not likely to return on a friday . 
had person make the same deduction ? 
person was attract to the lore of mailbox . 
he open the inner door ; the cooking odor be strong - all_over the city , at this hour , housewife would be fuss over stove . 
he climb , as quickly as he could urge his body , up the two unbroken flight to the third floor , pull himself along on a delicate balustrade , all that remain of the building 's beauty . 
he pause on the landing to steady his breathing and_then bend to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb overhead . 
now he be certain : the lock had not yield to person 's collection of key ; fresh scar show that the door had been prise open . 
it had been shut again , but the lock be broken ; he note with a thrill of fear that the door move under his touch . 
what was he to do now ? 
he had think no further than find person . 
he realize now he had more_than half hope he would n't find him - that person would not be here , that the attempt would be schedule for somewhere beyond person 's control . 
he could not break_in on an armed man . 
he would have to climb_down back down to the street and signal a cop . 
be there time ? 
his thought were scatter by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door . 
person push open the door : at the far end of the long dark room person was faintly silhouette against the window , the rifle still raise ; he stand with his foot apart on a kitchen_table he had drag to the sill . 
he turn his head to the source of the disturbance and instantly back to the window and his rifle sight , dismiss person for_the_moment with the same contempt he had show in their encounter at person 's apartment . 
person stretch his left_hand to the wall and fumble for the switch : evil flourish in the dark . 
the room was bathe in light at the instant person 's second shot come . 
person , nakedly expose at the bright window like a deer pin in a car 's headlight , throw down the rifle and turn to jump from the table ; his face wear a look of outrage . 
a shot catch him and straighten him up in screaming pain ; a following volley of shot shatter glass , rip the ceiling , and send him lurch heavily from the table . 
he be dead before his body make contact with the floor . 
person stumble back into the hall , lean_against the wall , and start to retch . 
after person send person for person he be able to complete his detailed inspection of the third floor and to receive a report from his man cover the floor above before person return , buoy_up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne . 
the safe at group stand next to the gum machine in a narrow passageway that lead to person 's office ( to the left ) , the lieutenant 's office ( far along and to the left ) and the janitor 's supply_closet ( straight ahead ) . 
the safe be a repository for three dead flashlight_battery , a_hundred and fifty unused left-hand fingerprint card , a stack of unsold policemen's_ball ticket from last year , and thirty-seven cent in coin and stamp . 
person set the captain 's fifth of hiram_walker inside the safe before he report to person , though he know that person 's ulcer prevent him from make any untoward incursion on person 's gift . 
it be more a matter of tact , and also it be none of person 's goddam business . 
he walk up_to the lieutenant 's office , lean wearily against the gun rack that house four rifle and a gas_gun nobody remember having use and a submachine_gun that was occasionally try_out on the group . 
he stare at the clerk who sit at a scarred and ancient fumed_oak desk stuff envelope . 
`` where 's the person '' ? 
the clerk wag his head toward the captain 's office . 
person go to the connecting door , which be open , and stand at attention while person , in full uniform , finish comb his hair . 
the lieutenant 's sparse brown hair be heavily pomaded , and as person rake the comb through it , it stick together in thatch so that it look_like umbrella rib cling to his pink skull . 
the lieutenant eye person 's reflection in the mirror over the washbowl and_then glance back at his own face , move the comb methodically around his head . 
leave me alone , person think . 
fight with person , fight with the whole damned group . 
but leave me alone . 
because i 'm look_for the son_of_a_bitch that kill that old_man , and i 'm going_to get him . 
if you just leave me to hell alone , person . 
person peer through half closed lid at his reflection , thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and about-face . 
person wait for person to sit_down behind the desk near the window . 
he sit stiff-backed in a chair that did not swivel , though it be obvious to person that person feel his position as acting captain plainly merit a swivel_chair . 
the desk before him be in no better repair than the rest of the furniture crowd into the room , include wooden file_cabinet with some of their pull yank off and a wardrobe stain with the roof seepage of countless season . 
person pull one thin leg up , clamp his arm around the shinbone to press his knee into an incredibly scrawny gut . 
it be the posture which the man had come to recognize as that of person defy his ulcer . 
he put his chin on his kneecap , stretch his neck like that of a turkey on a chopping_block , and stare wordlessly at his sergeant . 
person wait . 
the 7_:_45 bell ring and he could hear the outside_door bang shut , close in the assembled day_watch . 
finally , person intone through his hawk_nose , `` we can n't have people run in any time they please , person '' . 
`` no , sir '' . 
`` run in , run out . 
ca n't have it . 
make_for confusion and congestion '' . 
he rock back in the chair , knee lock against stomach , his beady eye fixed on person . 
he be silent again , possibly listen to the sound in the squadroom . 
roll was being call . 
person clear his throat . 
person say , `` you were expect to report to my office twenty minute ago , person . 
that 's not get all the juice out of the orange , now be it '' ? 
`` no , sir '' . 
then person smile . 
person know that nothing but ace back-to-back would give the lieutenant an ulcer and a smile at_the_same_time . 
the day_watch platoon commander , person , was call_out the beat assignment , but person could n't make the name mean anything . 
`` i call the station at three this morning '' , person 's nasal voice pronounce . 
`` do you have any idea who might have be in_charge at the time '' ? 
`` person , sir '' . 
`` now , now , you 're just guess , person '' . 
he smile thinly , savor his joke . 
`` what if i say nobody be here but a_couple_of patrolman '' ? 
`` sir , person know better than to leave the station without a relief . 
he must have '' - 
`` he let a patrolman take_over the duty of the station_keeper . 
now that be not regulation , be it '' ? 
`` no , sir '' . 
`` but you did n't know a thing about it , did you '' ? 
person lean forward ; his foot slip off the chair and he put_back it back again , frown now . 
`` that 's not take one 's command with a responsible attitude , person '' . 
person tell himself that the old bastard be a fool . 
but stupidity be no consolation when it have rank . 
`` i be out in the district , sir '' . 
`` oh , yes . 
so i have hear '' . 
he stretch a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk . 
`` i might point_out that your inability to report to my office this morning when you were instruct to do so has not , ah , limit my knowledge of your activity as you may have hope '' . 
he take_up a white sheet_of_paper , dark with single-spaced data . 
a car pull into the driveway outside the window . 
person know it be car_12 , the wagon , return from deliver location 's drunk-and-disorderly to the location . 
but for some fool reason he could n't remember which man he 'd put on the transfer detail . 
he stare at the report in person 's hand , sure it was write by person - just as sure as if he 'd submit it in his scrawled longhand . 
he suck_in his breath and keep quiet while person lay down the sheet again , wind the gold wire stem of his glasses around his ear and_then , eye the report as it lie before him on the desk , intone , `` person one fail to see that the station_keeper was properly relieve two absent himself throughout the entire watch without check on the station 's activity or the whereabouts of his section sergeant three permit member of the homicide_detail of the group to arrogate for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevent from carry_on his proper assignment four fail to notify the station commander person of a homicide occur in the district five frequent extralegal establishment known_as after-hours spot for purpose of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six '' - he lean_back and peel_off his glasses `` - fail to cooperate with the person by return promptly when so order . 
what have you to say to_that , person '' ? 
person sail the paper across the desk , but person did n't pick_up it up or even glance at it . 
`` well '' ? 
`` i did n't think person know so many big word , person '' . 
person lick his lip . 
`` person be an alert and conscientious law_enforcement officer . 
i do n't think his diligence mitigate your negligence , person '' . 
`` negligence , hell '' ! 
person hold his breath a moment , push the volume and pitch of his voice down under the trapdoor in his throat . 
`` sir . 
i would have be negligent and a goddam lousy cop to_boot , if i 'd sit around this station all night when somebody get_away with murder in my district . 
it 's too_bad i did n't call you , and it 's too_bad i let person use person when he could have have a boy who 'd be glad to learn something of homicide procedure . 
but i be not one damned bit sorry i go_out to question the people i know in the place they hang_around , and '' - 
`` let 's not push our patience beyond the danger_line , person '' , person nasale . 
`` i should n't like to have to write_up you up for insubordination as_well as dereliction of duty '' . 
person stiffen , his hand ball into fist at his side . 
he clamp his jaw to keep the fury from spill_out . 
an argument with person be as frustrating and as futile as a cap pistol on a firing_range . 
person lean forward again , rock comfortably with his arm still wrap around one knee . 
`` let 's just remember , person , that we must all carry_our_own_umbrella . 
a district station can n't run smoothly , unless '' - he interrupt himself , look around person at the doorway . 
`` morning , person '' . 
`` sorry , person . 
i think you had n't come_in yet '' . 
`` i 've be here for some time '' . 
he stand_up , cock his head and eye person coldly . 
`` the sergeant is just leave '' . 
it had come as no great surprise to person that the hot water in the shower did n't work , that person had throw_up all_over the stairs , or that some thieving bastard of a cop had walk_off with his cigarette . 
it was the best he could hope for on a watch that had end with a session in person 's office . 
now , as he pass the open counter that divide the assembly room from the business office , he nod and say good_night to the station_keeper and his clerk , not stop to hear the day_watch playback of his chewing_out . 
not that he gave a damn what the grapevine send_out about person 's little speech on the comportment of platoon commander . 
he just did n't want to talk_about it . 
if the acting captain want his acting lieutenant to sit on his ass around the station all night , person would just have to go_out and drag person back by the heel once an hour ; because he 'd be damned if he was going_to be a midwatch pencil_pusher just to please his ulcerated pro_tem captain . 
at the doorway he squint up at the gray morning overcast and pat his jacket pocket for the cigarette , remember then that he 'd leave them at the group . 
he could pick_up another pack on his way home , if he were go_home . 
but even before he start across the oiled road to his plymouth , park in the lot under the cypress_tree across from the station , he know that he was n't go_home . 
not_yet . 
it was nine o'clock in the morning : the hour which , like a spade turn clod of earth , expose to the day a myriad of busy creature that had lie_dormant in the quiet night . 
location at this hour was populate by a whole community that person could not have see on his tour of duty - the neighborhood that had know person by day . 
person had purchase the group seventeen year ago . 
it be professedly worth three thousand dollar in stock and good_will , and the name be written in gold in foot high letter across each of the two display_window . 
on the right window , at eye level , in smaller print but also in gold , be person , prop. , and under_that , se_habla_espanol . 
person take a razor to person , prop. , but leave the promise that spanish would be understand because he think it mean that spanish clientele would be welcome . 
language be no problem anyway ; person had only to signal from his doorway to summon aid from the ubiquitous bilingual child who play on the sidewalk of location . 
aside from the fact that business be slow this time_of_year and his one salesgirl be not the most enterprising , person have no worry at_all , and he say as much to person , who sit across from him in civilian clothes , on a jiffy-couch-a-bed , mauve velour , $ 79.89 nothing down special ! 
`` she be honest_as_the_day '' , person say , and add , `` person , i can say this to you : person be a_little too honest . 
you can n't tell a customer how much it 's going_to cost him to refinance his payment before he even sign for a loan on the money down ! 
a time_plan be a mere convenience , you understand , and when '' - he interrupt himself , smile . 
`` i put her in lamp . 
that way i do n't lose so much '' . 
`` why do n't you just hire somebody else '' ? 
`` she say she has to finish a story '' . 
he shrug . 
`` i ask her why she could n't do it tomorrow , but it seem the muse is work good tonight and she 's afraid to let_it_go '' . 
person make some comment , but his mind be busy as he consider the man . 
his name be person and he , too , had come from a good family . 
he be perhaps thirty-two , nicely set_up , with light_brown hair that have a pronounced wave . 
he be always well groomed and well tailored , and he have that rich_man 's look which be authentic enough and come from two good prep_school and a proper university . 
an only child , he had do all the thing that young_man do who have been bear to money and social position until his father double_cross him by die broke . 
since then he had work_at this and that , though some say his main interest be gambling . 
all this go through person 's mind in the first instant , but what hold his interest was the fact that these two should be together at_all . 
for he had understand that person had been engage to a boy name person . 
she had grow_up with young person , and he had hear that they had been at the point of marry at_least twice . 
he want to ask her about person now , but he know he could n't do so in person 's presence . 
and so , still wonder and a_little perplexed , he grin at the girl and speak lightly to make_sure that she would know he was kid . 
`` where did you pick_up him up '' ? 
`` oh , i 've know him quite a while '' . 
she glance at her companion fondly . 
`` have n't i , person '' ? 
`` i 've been_after her for years '' , person say , `` but i 've never been able to get anywhere until the last few day '' . 
the girl 's eye were softly shine as she reach_out and touch person 's hand . 
`` can i tell you a secret ? 
we 're going_to get_married . 
do you approve '' ? 
person keep his smile fixed , but some small inner disturbance was work_on him as he think again about person , who be eight or ten year old than the girl . 
he wonder whether person was going_to swear_off gambling and get a steady job or whether he was count_on the income from person 's estate to subsidize him . 
none of_this show in his face , and he try to keep his skepticism in_hand . 
he make a point of frown , of act_out the part of the fond father confessor . 
`` i 'll have to give it some thought '' , he say . 
`` you would n't want me to say yes without make sure his intention be honorable , would you '' ? 
she make a face at him and then she laugh . 
`` of_course not '' . 
`` i 'll get my reference in_order '' , person say , and though he speak with a smile , person somehow get the idea that he be not particularly amused . 
`` stop_by any time , person '' . 
he stand_up and touch the girl 's arm . 
`` come on , darling . 
if you be really serious about work_on that story , i 'd better take you home '' . 
person watch them go , still frown absently and_then dismiss the matter as he call_for his check . 
as he go_out he tell person the dinner be perfect , and when he get his hat and coat from person and put a fifty-cent_piece in the slot , he tell her to be sure that it go toward her dowry . 
a taxi take him back to the bar and grill where he had leave his car , and a_few minute later he find a parking_space across the street from his apartment . 
because his mind had been otherwise occupy for the past couple of hour , he did not think to look and see if person 's car be still there . 
in_fact , he did not think_about person at_all until he enter his living_room and close the door behind him . 
only then , when his glance focus_on the divan and see that it be empty , did he remember his earlier problem . 
even from where he stand he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread_over person , the pillow , the sheet_of_paper on top of it . 
then he was stride across the room , his thought confused but the worry build swiftly inside him as he snatch_up the note . 
person : 
look in the wastebasket . 
i know the only way i could beat you was to play_possum , but it be a good try , kid , and i appreciate it . 
j. . 
the wastebasket stand near the wall next to the divan , and the instant person pick_up it up he know what had happen . 
the discarded papers inside be sodden , there be a glint of liquid at the bottom , and the smell of whisky be strong and distinct . 
he put the wastebasket down distastefully , mutter softly and thoroughly disgusted with himself and his plan that had seem so foolproof . 
for he remember too well how he had bring back the loaded drink to person and_then return to the kitchen to get weak drink for himself . 
for another second or two he give_in to the annoyance that was direct at himself ; then his mind move_on to be confront by something far more serious , and as the thought expand , the implication jar him . 
it no_longer matter that person had outsmart him . 
the important thing be that person had go somewhere to meet a blackmailer with a gun in his pocket . 
and that gun be empty . 
even before his mind had round_out the idea , he thrust one hand into his trouser pocket and pull_out the six slug he had take from the revolver . 
he consider them with brooding eye , brow bunch as his brain grapple with the problem and try to find some solution . 
he say : `` the crazy fool '' , half aloud . 
he put the shell on the table , as though he could no_longer bear to hold them . 
he think : where the hell could he have go ? 
how can i find him ? 
there be no answer to this and he begin to pace back_and_forth across the room , his imagination out of control . 
he try to tell himself that maybe person had sober_up enough to get some sense . 
maybe he only intend to scare the blackmailer , whoever he be , in_which_case an unloaded gun would be good_enough . 
he think_of other possibility , none of them satisfactory , and finally he begin to think , to wonder if there be some way he could reach person . 
then , as he turn toward the telephone , it ring shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reach for it eagerly . 
`` yeah '' , he say . 
`` person '' ? 
`` yeah '' . 
`` person '' . 
person hear the voice distinctly and he know who it be , but it take him a while to make the mental readjustment and control the disturbance inside his head . 
when he hear person say : `` what about that picture you take this afternoon '' ? it still take him another few second to remember the job he had do for person . 
`` what picture '' ? he demand . 
`` you take a picture of me at the corner of location and location about three_thirty this afternoon '' . 
`` who say so '' ? 
`` one of my boy '' . 
person believe that much . 
person be not the sort who walk_around without one of his `` boy '' close_at_hand . 
`` so '' ? 
`` with my trial come_up in federal_court next week i would n't want that picture publish '' . 
`` who say it 's going to be publish '' ? 
`` i would n't even want it to get_around '' . 
under normal circumstance person be a_little fussy when people tell him what to do with picture he had take . 
even_so , he generally listen and be usually reasonable to those who voice their objection properly . 
right now , however , he was still too worry about person , and the gun that have no bullet , and the story person had tell him , to care too_much about person . 
his nerves were get a_little ragged and his impatience put an edge in his voice . 
`` look '' , he say . 
`` i was hire to take a picture . 
i take it . 
that be all i know about it and that be all i care '' . 
`` maybe you 'd well tell the guy who hire you what i say '' . 
`` you tell him '' . 
`` all_right '' , person say , his voice still quiet . 
`` but i mean what i say , person . 
if that picture get_around and i find_out you have anything to do with it , i 'm going_to send a_couple_of my boy around to see you '' . 
`` you do that '' , person say . 
`` just be sure to send your two best boy , person '' . 
he hang_up with a bang , annoyed at himself for running_off_at_the_mouth like that but still terribly concern with the situation he had help to create . 
as_soon_as he could think logically again he reach for the telephone_directory and find person 's home number . 
he dial it and listen to it ring ten time before he hang_up . 
he call the bar and grill where he had pick_up person up that afternoon . 
when he was tell that no one had see person since then , he think_of three other place that be possibility . 
each time he get the same answer and in_the_end he give_up . 
by the time he had smoke three cigarette he had calm_down . 
he had do all he could and that be that . 
and anyway person be not the kind of guy who would be likely to get in_trouble even when he be drunk . 
he , person , had been scare for_a_while , but that had come mostly from the fact that he feel responsible . 
he should have stay here and watch person . 
he did n't . 
so he make a mistake . 
so what ? 
he keep tell himself this as he go_out to the kitchen to make a drink . 
only then did he decide he did n't want one . 
he consider open a can of beer but veto that idea too . 
finally he go_into the bedroom and sit_down to take_off his shoe . 
he had just finish unlace the right one when the telephone ring again . 
when he snatch it up the voice that come to him be quick and urgent . 
`` person ? 
you do n't know me but i know you . 
if you want a picture get to the corner of location and location just as fast as you can . 
if you hurry you might beat the headquarters boy '' . 
person hear the click of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth , and it take him no more than three second to decide . 
for over the year he had receive many such call . 
some of them come from people who identify themselves . 
some telephone because he had do them a favor in the past . 
others because they expect some sort of reward for the information . 
a_few pass along a tip for the simple reason that they like him and want to give him a break . 
only an occasional tip turn_out to be a phony , and , like the police , person had make a point of run_down all such suggestion and he did not hesitate this time . 
he be in his car with his camera and equipment bag in less_than two minute , and it take him only three more to reach the corner , a block from location . 
it be a district of small factory and loft building and occasional tenement , and he could see the police_car as he round the corner and slam_on the brake . 
he did not bother with his radio - there would be time for that later - but as he scramble out on the pavement he see the filling_station and the public telephone_booth and know instantly how he had been summon . 
the police_car had pull_up behind a small sedan , its headlight still on . 
miraculously , she find exactly the right statement . 
she begin it deliberately , so that none of her words would be lost on him . 
`` i want to tell you something person . 
i be well aware that you 've have_got a pedigree as long as my leg , and that i do n't amount to anything . 
but '' - 
`` but it do n't matter a-tall '' , person supply fondly . 
`` to me you 'll always be the girl o ' my dream , an ' the sweet flower that grow '' . 
beam idiotically , he pooch out his lip and attempt to kiss her . 
she yank away from him furiously . 
`` you shut_up ! 
shu-tt up-pp ! 
i 've have_got something to say to you , and by god you 're going to listen . 
do you hear me ? 
you 're going to listen '' ! 
person nod agreeably . 
he say he want very_much to listen . 
he know that anything a brainy little lady like her have to say would be plumb important , as_well_as pleasing ' to the ear , and he did n't want to miss a word of_it . 
so would she mind speak a_little loud ? 
`` i think you stink , person ! 
i think you be mean and hateful and stupid , and - loud '' ? say person . 
`` uh-huh . 
so i can hear you while i 'm check ' the car . 
look like we might be in_for a speck of trouble '' . 
he open the door and get_out . 
he wait at the car side for a moment , look down at her expectantly . 
`` well ? 
was n't you goin ' to say somethin '' ' ? 
then , helpfully , as she merely stare at him in weary silence , `` maybe you could write_down it down for me , huh ? 
print it in real big letter , an ' i can cipher it out later '' . 
`` aah , go_on '' , she say . 
`` just go the hell on '' . 
he grin , nod , and walk_around to the front of the car . 
lip purse mournfully , he stare down at its crazily sagging left side . 
then he hunker_down on the heel of his handmade boot , peer into the orderly chaos of axle , shock_absorber , and spring . 
he go prone on his stomach , the_better to pursue his examination . 
after a time , he straighten again , brush the red permian dust from his hand , slap it from his six dollar levis and his tailored , twenty-five dollar shirt . 
he wear no gun - a strange omission for a peace_officer in this country . 
never , he 'd once tell person , had he encounter any man or situation that call_for a gun . 
and he really feel that way , she think . 
that be really all he 's get , all he be . 
just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package . 
if i could make myself feel the same way . 
she study him hopefully , yearningly ; against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it be easy to confirm her analysis . 
here in the godforsaken place , the westerly end of nowhere , person look almost insignificant , almost contemptible . 
he be handsome , with his coal-black hair and eye , his fine chiseled feature . 
but she 'd know plenty of handsome guy , and , concede his good_looks , what was there leave ? 
he be n't a big man ; rather on the medium side . 
neither be he very powerful of build . 
he could move very quickly , she know ( although he seldom find occasion to do so ) , but he be more wiry than truly strong . 
and his relatively small hand and foot give him an almost delicate appearance . 
just nothing , she tell herself . 
just so darned sure of himself that he puts_the_indian_sign on everyone . 
but , by gosh , i want him and i 'm going_to have him ! 
he catch her eye , come_back around the car with the boot wearer 's teeter , half mincing walk . 
why did these yokel still wear boot , anyway , when most had scarcely sit a horse in year ? 
he slide in at her side , tuck a cigar into his mouth , and politely proffer one to her . 
`` oh , cut_it_out , person '' ! she snap . 
`` ca n't you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute '' ? 
`` this ai n't your brand , maybe '' , person suggest . 
`` or maybe you just do n't feel_like a cigar '' ? 
`` i feel_like get_back to town , that be what i feel_like ! 
now , are you going_to take me or am i supposed_to walk '' ? 
`` might get there faster walk '' ' , person drawl , `` see ' as how i have_got a busted front spring . 
on_the_other_hand , howsomever , maybe you would n't either . 
i figger it be probably a sixty-five mile walk , and i c_'_n maybe get this spring patch_up in a_couple_of hour '' . 
`` how - with what ? 
there 's nothing out here but rattlesnake '' . 
`` now , ai n't it the truth '' ? 
person laugh with secret amusement . 
`` not a danged thing but rattlesnake , so i reckon i 'll get the boss rattler to help me '' . 
`` person ! 
for_god 's sake '' ! 
`` looky '' . 
he point , cut_off her off . 
`` see that wildcat '' ? 
she see it then , the distant derrick of the wildcat - a test well in unexplored country . 
and even with her limited knowledge of such thing , she know that the car could be repair there ; sufficiently , at_least , to get them back into town . 
a wildcatter had to be prepared for almost any emergency . 
he had_to depend_on himself , since he be invariably mile and hour away from others . 
`` well , let 's get_going '' , she say impatiently . 
`` i '' - she break_off , frown . 
`` what did you mean by that rattlesnake gag ? 
get the boss rattlesnake to help you '' ? 
`` why , i mean what i say '' , person declare . 
`` what else would i mean , anyways '' ? 
she look at him , lip compress . 
then , with a shrug of pretended indifference , she take a compact from her purse and went_through_the_motions of fix her makeup . 
in his mood , it be the best way to handle him ; that_is , to show no curiosity whatsoever . 
otherwise , she would be bait into a tantrum - tease and provoke until she lose control of herself , and thus lose still another battle in the maddening struggle of person vs. person . 
the car lurch along at a snail 's crawl , the left front mudguard bang and scrape against the tire , occasionally scrape against the road itself . 
person whistle tunelessly as he fight the steering_wheel . 
he seem very pleased with himself , as though some intricate scheme was work_out exactly as he had plan . 
along with this self-satisfaction , however , person sense a growing tension . 
it pour out of him like an electric_current , a feeling that the muscle and nerve of his fine drawn body were coil for action , and that that action would be all that he anticipate . 
person had see him like this once before - more_than once , actually , but on one particularly memorable occasion . 
that be the day that he had practically mopped_up the main_street of location with person , field boss for the group . 
person had been lay for person for a long_time , just wait to catch him out of line . 
person give him his opportunity when he show_up in town with a pistol on his hip . 
he have a legitimate reason for wear it . 
it was payday for highlands , and he was pack a lot of money back into the oilfield . 
moreover , as_long_as the weapon was carry openly , the sheriff 's office had make no previous issue of_it . 
`` so what 's this all about '' ? he demand , when person confront him . 
i be not the only man in town with a gun , or the only one without a permit `` . 
it be the wrong thing to say . 
by fail to do as he was tell instantly - to take_out a permit or return the gun to his car - he had play into person 's hand . 
the trouble be that he had virtually had_to protest . 
the deputy had force him to by his manner of accost him . 
so , `` how about it '' ? he say . 
`` why single_out me out on this permit deal '' ? 
`` well , i 'll tell you about that '' , person tell him . 
`` we aim t ' be selective , y_'_know ? 
do n't like to bother no_one unless we have to , which i figger we do , in your case . 
figger we got_to be plumb careful with any of you group big_shot '' . 
person redden . 
he himself had hear that there was gangster money in the company , but that have nothing to do with him . 
he be an honest man do a hard job , and the implication that he be anything else be unbearable . 
`` look , person '' , he say hoarsely . 
`` i know you have_got a grudge against me , and maybe i can n't blame you . 
you think that group swindle you and i help ' em do it . 
but you be all wrong , man ! 
i be no lawyer . 
i just do what i 'm told , and '' - 
`` uh-huh . 
an ' that could mean trouble with a fella that 's work ' for crook . 
so you get_rid_of that pistol right now , person . 
you do that or take_out you out a permit right now '' . 
person could n't do either , of_course . 
not immediately , as the deputy demand . 
not without a face-saving respite of at_least a_few minute . 
to do so would make his job well-nigh impossible . 
oilfield worker be a rough tough lot . 
how could he exert authority over them - make them toe_the_line , as he have to - if he knuckle_under to this small_town clown ? 
`` i 'll get_around_to it a_little later '' , he mumble desperately . 
`` just as_soon_as i go to the bank , and '' - 
`` huh-uh . 
now , person '' , say person , and he lay a firmly restrain hand on the field boss 's arm . 
it be strictly the deputy 's game , but person had go too far to throw_in . 
now , he could only play the last card in what be probably the world 's cold deck . 
he fling off person 's hand and attempt to push past him , inadvertently shove him into a storefront . 
it be practically the last move that person make of his own volition . 
person slug him in the stomach , so hard that the organ almost press against his spine . 
then , as he double , gasp , vomit the breakfast he had so lately eat , person straighten him with an uppercut . 
a rabbit_punch redouble him . 
and_then there was a numbing blow to the heart , and another gut flatten blow to the stomach . 
but he could n't keep_up with them . 
no_more could he defend himself against them . 
he seem to be fight not one man but a dozen . 
and he could no_longer think_of face_saving , of honor , but only of escape . 
why , he 's go to kill me , he think wildly . 
i mean him no harm . 
i 've give willful hurt to no man . 
i was just do my job , just follow order , and for that he 's going to kill me . 
beat me to death in_front_of a_hundred people . 
somehow more terrible than the certainty that he be about to die be the knowledge that person would probably not suffer for it : the murder would go unpunished . 
he , person , would be cite as in the wrong , and he , person , would go scot_free , an officer who had only do his duty , though perhaps too energetically . 
person stagger into the street , flop sprawl in the stinging dust . 
fear maddened , flee the lengthening shadow of death , he scramble to his foot again . 
he could n't see ; he be long past the point of coherent thinking . 
dimly , he hear laughter , hoot of derision , but he could not read the racket properly . 
he could not grasp that person had withdraw from the fight minute ago , and that his leaden arm were flail at nothing but the air . 
he hate them too_much to understand - the people of_this isolated law unto itself world that be person 's world . 
this , he be sure , be the way they would act ; laugh_at a dying man , laugh as a man was beat to death . 
and nothing would be do about it . 
nothing unless & & & . 
person ! 
person , his young wife , the girl who be both daughter and wife to him . 
person be like he be . 
she live by the rule , never compromise , never blind or divert by circumstance . 
and person would - 
when he regain consciousness he be in person 's house , in the office of person , the deputy 's deceased father . 
the person outfit - known as the group because of its brand - reach location before sundown . 
the herd was water and_then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night 's bedground . 
two of the new hand , a mexican named person and a kid known only as person , were pick for the first trick of ride_herd night herd . 
the rest of the crew offsaddle their mount and turn them into the remuda . 
they get tin cup of coffee from the big pot on the coosie 's fire , roll and light brown paper cigarette , lounge_about . 
there was some idle_talk , a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the day 's drive . 
but they deliberately avoid the one subject that have them all curious : 
the failure of the boss 's wife and son to join the outfit . 
it especially bother the old hand . 
the cook , person , had arrive there long before the herd . 
he 'd start a fire and put_on coffee on , and now be busy at the workboard of his chuck_wagon . 
he was ready a batch of sourdough biscuit for the dutch_oven . 
supper would be ready within the hour . 
the person family was set_up a separate camp nearby . 
person had unhitch the mule from both person 's and his father 's wagon . 
person had gather wood for a cookfire , and his wife be busy at it now . 
person keep_an_eye_on the twin and little person , try to keep them from fall into the creek by which they persist in play . 
person nag at the young child , attempt without success to keep her thought off person . 
person had catch_up_with the outfit shortly after the person join it , which had be at midday . 
he 'd come alone , without his wife and child . 
he 'd be in an angry mood : person had think his face almost ugly with the anger in him . 
she wonder what had take_place in town , between him and his wife . 
she wish that she could talk to her mother about it . 
not that her mother know what had happen , but they could speculate upon it . 
but her mother would rebuke her if she mention it , and say that it be none of her concern . 
`` person , get_out of that creek ! 
you too , person ! 
person , you 'll get mud all_over your dress '' ! 
even as she call to the child , person let her gaze seek person . 
person , she call him - as the mexican hand did . 
he be in earnest conversation with her father and the old vaquero , person . 
whatever they are talk_about ? 
person wonder . 
it bother her that she probably would never know . 
certainly , she would n't dare ask her father afterward . 
he would tell her not to pry into grownup ' affairs - as though she be a little kid like person ! 
at the moment , the three man were not say much of anything . 
they were sit on their heel , rider fashion , over by the still empty calf wagon . 
person be hunkered_down with his broad back to the left rear wheel , with the other two face him . 
he hold a cigarette in his right_hand . 
it was burn away , forgotten . 
his face be clouded with unhappiness . 
he 'd tell person and person about his wife 's refusal to come_with him and about what he now intend to do . 
they were consider it gravely , neither seem to like what he plan . 
finally person say , `` i could offer you advice , person , but you would n't heed it '' . 
`` let 's hear it , anyway '' . 
`` wait a little while . 
let person live in her father 's house for a time . 
give her time to miss you . 
maybe she will then come to you . 
after_all , you want the senora as_much_as you want the boy . 
you need her even more_than you need him '' . 
`` she won n't change her mind '' , person say . 
`` person will see to that '' . 
`` but after a time away from you & & & '' . 
`` a year , person ? 
five ? 
ten ? 
how long should i wait '' ? 
`` maybe in a year , person & & & '' . 
`` in a year she 'll like live in person 's house too_much to come_back to me '' , person say flatly . 
`` and the boy will be too_much under his influence by then . 
i 've got_to take_away person away from person before i lose him altogether . 
hell , in a year or five or ten , the boy will have forget me - his own father '' ! 
`` but to take him and leave_behind his mother behind be not good '' . 
`` in my place , you 'd follow such advice as you give me '' ? 
person look suddenly uncertain . 
`` that i can n't answer , for i can n't imagine something like this happen to me . 
maybe i should withdraw my advice - no '' ? 
person look at person . 
`` and you ? 
what would you do in my place '' ? 
person shake his head . 
`` i do n't know , person . 
like person , i can n't see something like this happen to me . 
with person and me , there 's never any problem . 
where i go , she go - and the kid with us . 
you 're going_to need your woman . 
and the boy will need his mother . 
if you take the one , you had_better take both '' . 
person shake his head . 
`` i won n't force person to come against her will . 
but i 'm going_to have my son '' . 
they be silent for a little while , each look glum . 
finally person say , `` what_must_be_,_must_be . 
i be with you , of_course , person '' . 
and person add , `` so be i , person '' . 
`` all_right '' , person say , rise . 
`` we 'll ride out as_soon_as we 've have chuck '' . 
person time it so that they ride in an hour after nightfall . 
they have for cover both darkness and a summer storm . 
during much of the fifteen mile ride they had watch a lurid display of lightning in the sky to the east . 
later , they 'd hear the rumble of thunder and_then , just outside location , they run_into rain . 
those who have slicker don them . 
the others put_on old coat or ducking jacket , whichever they carry behind their saddle cantle . 
there were seven of them , enough for a show of strength - to run a bluff . 
it was to be nothing more_than that . 
there was to be no gunplay . 
if the bluff fail and they run_into trouble , person had tell the others , they would withdraw - and he would come after his son another time . 
he did n't want to put himself outside the law . 
with him be person , person , and person 's son person . 
the person brother be also along . 
the seventh man be person , a wiry little puncher with a wild streak and a liking for hell_raising . 
they be all good man . 
it was dark early , because of the storm . 
also because of the storm , the street of location be deserted . 
lighted window glow jewel bright through the downpour . 
they rein_in before the town marshal 's office , a box sized building on location . 
a lamp burn inside , but person , peer through the window , see that the office be empty . 
he 'd hope to catch person there . 
`` probably just step_out '' , he say . 
`` maybe to have supper . 
person , come along . 
the rest of you wait here '' . 
with person , he ride to the location . 
person get_down from the saddle and have_a_look inside . 
`` not there '' , he say , get_on back onto his horse . 
`` maybe he be at the hotel '' . 
they ride to the location , a_little far along the opposite side of the street . 
they rein_in there , person remain in the saddle while person go to look_for person in the hotel dining_room . 
person have no slicker . 
he 'd put_on his old brown corduroy coat and it be already soaked . 
but he feel no physical discomfort . 
he be only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain . 
he hardly notice the blue green flash of lightning and the hard clap of thunder . 
person reappear , stop on the hotel porch , lift a hand in signal . 
person dismount and climb the steps . 
`` he 's finish eat '' , person say . 
`` sit with a cup of coffee now . 
it should n't be long '' . 
it seem long , at_least to person . 
he and person wait by the door , one to either side . 
person be the third man to come_out , and he come unhurriedly . 
he was puff on a cigar , and he was turn_up his coat collar against the rain . 
it was not until he move across the porch that he become aware of them , and_then it was too late . 
they close_in fast , keep him from reach inside his coat for his gun . 
`` just come along '' , person tell him . 
`` do n't start anything you can n't finish '' . 
`` now , listen '' - person begin . 
`` we 'll talk over at your office '' . 
`` person , i warn you '' ! 
`` let 's go , marshal '' , person say , and take him by the arm . 
person grip the lawman 's other arm . 
they escort him down from the porch and through the rain to his office . 
the other five group man follow them inside , crowd the small room . 
his face be stiff with anger when they let_go_of his arm . 
he look at each of them in_turn , person last of all . 
`` i 'll remember you '' , he say . 
`` every_last one of you . 
as for you , person '' - 
`` put your gun on the desk , marshal '' . 
`` now , hold_on , damn_it ; i won n't '' - 
person 's patience run_out . 
he lift the skirt of person 's coat , take his gun from its holster , toss it onto the desk . 
`` too_much fool_around '' , he say . 
`` do n't press_your_luck , badge toter '' . 
person say , `` now the key to the lockup , marshal '' . 
`` key '' ? 
person say . 
`` what for '' ? 
`` ca n't you guess '' ? 
person say . 
`` we 're put you where you won n't come to harm . 
come_on - the key . 
get_out it out '' ! 
`` damned if i will . 
person , you 've assault a law_officer and '' - 
they move_in_on him , crowd him from all side . 
no man lay a hand on him , but the threat of violence be there . 
his face take_on a sudden pallor , become beaded with sweat , and he seem to have trouble with his breathing . 
he hold_out a moment longer , then his nerve give under the pressure . 
he swear , and say , `` all_right . 
it be here in my pocket '' . 
`` get_out it out '' , person order . 
then , as person obey : `` now let 's go out back '' . 
resignedly , person turn to the back door . 
they follow him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty foot to the rear . 
the door of the lockup be of oak plank and band with strap iron . 
it be secured by an oversized padlock . 
person balk again , not want to unlock and open the door . 
they crowd him in that threatening way once_more , force him to give_in . 
once the door be open , they crowd him inside the dark building . 
he was utter threat in a low but savage voice when they close and padlock the door . 
they return to the street , mount their horse , ride through the rain to the big house on location . 
its window glow with lamplight . 
person still stand_guard on the veranda , a forlorn , scarecrowish figure in the murky dark . 
he come to the edge of the veranda , peer down at them with his hand on his gun . 
`` do n't try it '' , person tell him , dismount and start up the steps with his men follow . 
`` do n't get yourself kill for something that does n't concern you '' . 
he stride past the now frightened man , enter the house . 
person and person remain on the veranda to keep person from interfere . 
the others follow person inside . 
they trail him across the wide hallway to the parlor , four roughly garbed and tough look man who probably had never before venture into such a house . 
they bring to it all the odor that cling to man like themselves , that of their own sweat , of campfire smoke , of horse and cattle . 
they track mud on the oaken floor , on the carpet . 
their presence foul the elegance of that room . 
and their arrival catch person and person off_guard . 
the author of the anonymous note seem to be all-knowing . 
for man who had leave cattle alone after get their first notice had receive no second . 
but the day of the deadline come and pass , and the man who had scoff at the warning laugh with satisfaction . 
for , with a single exception , nothing had happen to them . 
the exception be an location settler name person . 
after walk out to his corral that morning , he 'd be amazed to see the dust puff_up in_front of his foot . 
a split_second later , the distant crack of a rifle had sound . 
he 'd mount_up immediately and race with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he 'd estimate the shot had come . 
but he had find all_of the thicket and point of cover deserted . 
there had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or trace to show that anyone had be near . 
person be a man who had make a full-time job of cow stealing . 
he had n't even pretend to be farm his spread . 
his land had never been plow . 
he had do his rustling openly and boast about it . 
he had receive both first and second anonymous notice , and each time he had accuse his neighbor of write them . 
he had curse at them and threaten them . 
he be a man , those neighbor testify later , who did n't have a friend in the world . 
person make the round of all who live near him again , that august morning after a bullet land at his foot , and once_more he accuse and threaten everyone . 
`` i 'll be ready next time '' ! he rage . 
`` i 'll be shoot ' right back '' . 
he have his chance the very next morning , for exactly the same thing happen again . 
this time person have his own rifle in his hand , and he throw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off shot , then spend most_of the day search out the area . 
he find nothing , but he still refuse to give_up and move out . 
`` just let me meet_up_with that damned bushwhacking ' coward face-to-face '' ! he explode . 
`` that be all i ask '' ! 
he never get that chance . 
for the unseen , ghostlike rifleman aim a_little high the third time . 
a .30-30 bullet smash directly into the center of person ' chest . 
he slump against a log fence_rail , then try to lift himself . 
two more shot follow in quick succession , drop him limp and huddled on the ground . 
an inquest was hold , and after a good_deal of testimony about the anonymous note , the county coroner estimate that the shooting had been do from a distance of 300 yard . 
rumor of the offer person had make at the group meeting had leak_out by then , and as a grand_jury investigation of the murder get underway , the prosecuting_attorney , a person , order that the tall stock detective be summon for questioning . 
it take some time to locate person . 
he was finally find in the location region of location , two county away . 
person immediately assume he was hide_out there after the shooting and begin prepare an indictment . 
but that indictment was never make . 
for person , it turn_out , have a number of rancher and cowboy witness ready and willing to swear with straight_face that he had be in location the day of the killing . 
the former scout 's alibi could n't be shake . 
the authorities had to release him . 
he immediately ride on to cheyenne , throw a ten day drinking spree and drop some very strong hint among friend . 
`` dead center at three hundred yard , that coroner say '' ! he 'd grin . 
`` three shot in_that fella ' fore he hit the ground ! 
you reckon there be two man in_this state can shoot like that '' ? 
publicly , he deny everything . 
privately , he create and magnify an image of himself as a hired assassin . 
for a blood chilling ring of terror to the very sound of his name be the tool he need for the job he 'd promise to do . 
person be soon back at_work , give his secret employer their money 's worth . 
a good many beef hungry settler were accept the death of person as proof that the warning note be not idle threat . 
the company herd were being raid less often , and cabin and soddy all_over the range were stand deserted . 
but there were other homesteader who pass_off the person murder off as a personal grudge killing , the work of one of his neighbor . 
the rustling problem be by_no_means solved . 
even in the very area where the shooting had been do , cattle were still disappear . 
for less_than a dozen mile from the unplowed land of the dead man live another settler who had ignore the warning that his existence might be foreclose on - a blatant and defiant rustler name person . 
`` person be mighty crude about the way he take_in cattle '' his own hired_man , person , mention later . 
`` everyone know it , but he sort_of act like he did n't care who know it - even after them note come , even after he 'd hear about person , even after he 'd been shoot at a couple o ' time hisself '' ! 
on the morning of september 10 , 1895 , person and person rise at dawn and begin their day 's work . 
haying_time be close at_hand , and they need some strong branch to repair a hay rack . 
harness a team to a buckboard , they drive out to a willow lined creek about a half_mile off , then climb_down and begin chop . 
person had just start swing an ax at his second willow when the distant blast of a rifle sound . 
he look_around in surprise , then notice that person was clutch his chest . 
the hired_man run over to help his boss . 
`` my god , i 'm shoot '' ! 
person gasp . 
and he collapse and die instantly . 
person have no intention of search for the assassin . 
he heave the dead man onto the buckboard , yell and lash at the team and get_out of there fast . 
but he bring back the sheriff and several deputy , and to the lawman the entire affair seem a repetition of the person killing . 
a detailed scouring of the entire area reveal nothing beyond a ledge of rock that might have be the rifleman 's hiding_place . 
there were no track of either hoof or boot . 
not even an empty cartridge case could be find . 
once_again , person be the first and most likely suspect , and he was bring_in for questioning immediately . 
once_again , he shake his head , keep his face expressionless and his voice very calm , and have a strongly support alibi ready . 
later , ride in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional lady of cheyenne , he lay_claim to the killing with the vague insinuation he make . 
`` exterminate ' cow thief be just a business proposition with me '' , he 'd blandly announce . 
`` and i sort_of ' get a corner on the market '' . 
`` person '' , a friend ask him once , `` how_come you bushwhack them rustler ? 
they would n't o ' stand no chance with you in a plain , straight-out shoot-down '' . 
he have lots of friend , then as always . 
even as he become widely known_as a professional killer , nearly every cowboy and rancher in wyoming seem proud to call him a friend . 
no man 's name bring more cheer when it was announce in a rodeo . 
`` well '' , he explain , `` suppose you be a nester swing ' the long rope ? 
which would you be most scared of - a dry-gulchin ' or a shoot-down '' ? 
`` yeah , i can see that '' , the friend was force to agree . 
`` but , well , it just do n't seem sporting ' somehow '' ! 
`` sporting '' ' ! 
the tall sunburnt rustler hunter stare in amazement . 
`` sporting '' ' ! he echo again in soft wonder . 
`` i see a lot o ' thing in my time . 
i find a trooper once the apache had spread-eagle on an anthill , and another time we run_across some teamster they 'd catch , tie upside_down on their own wagon_wheel over little fire until their brain was explode right out o ' their skull . 
i hear o ' texas cattleman wrap_up ' a cow thief up in green hide and let ' the sun shrink ' em and squeeze him to death . 
but there 's one thing i never see or hear of , one thing i just do n't think there is , and that be a sporting ' way o ' kill ' a man '' ! 
after the first two murder , the warning note were rarely ignore . 
the lesson had been learn . 
the example be plain . 
when person 's brother-in-law , person , move_into the dead man 's home , the anonymous letter_writer take_a_chance no chances on person take_up where person had leave_off and waste no time on a first notice : 
if you do n't leave this country within 3 day , your life will be take the same as person 's was . 
this be the message find tack to the cabin door . 
person leave , within three day . 
all through location and location county , other man were do the same . 
house of settler who 'd treat the company herd as a natural_resource , free for the take , were sit empty , with weed grow high in their yard . 
the small half-heartedly tend field of man who 'd spend more time rustle cattle than farm were lie fallow . 
no cow thief could count_on a jury of his sympathetic peer to free him any_longer . 
jury , judge and executioner were ride the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere , at any time , to dispense an ancient brand of justice the man of the new west had believe long outdated . 
for three straight year , person patrol the southern wyoming pasture , and how_many man he kill after person and person ( if he kill person and person ) will never be known . 
it be possible , although highly doubtful , that he kill none at_all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claim every unsolved murder in the state . 
it be also possible , but equally doubtful , that he actually shoot down the hundred of man with which his legend credit him . 
for that legend was grow explosively , rumor was insist he receive a price of $ 600 a man . 
( the best evidence be that he receive a monthly wage of about $ 125 , very good money in an era when top hand work for $ 30 and found . ) 
rumor had_it he slip two small rock under each victim 's head as a sort of trademark . 
( a detailed search of old coroner 's report fail to substantiate this in the slightest . ) 
one thing be certain - his method be effective , so effective that after a time even the warning notice be often unnecessary . 
the mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field_glasses had been see ride that way be enough to frighten three rustle homesteader out of the location country in a single week . 
`` my reputation be my stock in trade '' , person mention more_than once . 
he evidently could n't foresee that it might be his downfall in_the_end . 
he had make himself the personification of the_devil to the homesteader . 
but to the cattleman who had been face bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboy who had been face with layoff a_few year earlier , he was become a vastly different type of legendary figure . 
such_as rancher as person and person and the person brother carry him on their book as a cowhand even while he was receive a much larger salary from party unknown . 
he make their spread his headquarters , and he help_out in their roundup . 
in the cow camp , person was regard_as a hero , as the same kind of champion he be when he enter and invariably win the local rodeo . 
the hand and their boss see him as a lone knight of the range , wage a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society that was threaten a beloved way_of_life . 
the wail , guitar strum minstrel of the cattle kingdom make_up song about him . 
by 1898 , rustling losses had been drive down to the low level ever see in wyoming . 
when several minute had pass and person had n't emerge from the livery_stable , person re-enter the hotel and face person across the counter . 
`` i have a little job for you , person . 
i be sure you won n't mind do me a small favor '' . 
person 's voice be oily , but person was n't fool . 
he moisten his lip uneasily . 
`` what is it you want me to do , person '' ? 
person shrug carelessly . 
`` it 's very simple . 
i just want you to take a message to person . 
tell her to come here to the hotel '' . 
vastly relieved , person nod and start toward the door . 
`` one thing , person '' , person say . 
`` you 're not to mention my name . 
tell her person want to see her '' . 
person pull_up short , and turn_around . 
`` i do n't know , person '' , he say haltingly , begin to get an inkling of person 's plan . 
`` it does n't seem quite right , tell her a thing like that . 
could n't i just '' - his voice trail off into silence . 
person continue to smile , but his eye be cold . 
he turn and look_around at the lobby as though see thing he had n't before notice . 
`` you know , person '' , he say thoughtfully . 
`` location 's location ought to have a fire_company . 
if someone were to drop a match in here , this place would go_up like a haystack '' . 
he start toward the stairway , then turn to add , `` tell her to come to person 's room , that person be in_trouble . 
tell her to hurry '' . 
`` yes sir '' . 
his face pale , person head for the street . 
person 's visit to the livery_stable had be merely a precaution in_case anyone should be watch . 
he pause only long enough to ascertain that person 's buckskin be still missing and that his own gray be all_right , then climb through a back window and drop to the ground outside . 
the fact that person 's horse had not been return to its stall could indicate that person 's information had be wrong , but person did n't interpret it this way . 
a man like person would want to have a ready means of escape in_case it was need . 
probably his horse would be close to where he was hide . 
from the back of the barn it be a simple matter to reach person 's house without use the street . 
person approach the place cautiously , and watch it several minute from the protection of a grove of tree . 
there was a light in person 's front_room , but drawn curtain prevent any view of the interior . 
person circle the house and locate a barn out back . 
he could hear horse move around inside , and nothing else . 
there was no lock on the door , only an iron hook which he unfasten . 
he open the door and go_in , pull it shut behind him . 
again he stand in the darkness listen , but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank floor . 
he move ahead carefully , his left_hand in_front of him , and come to a wooden partition . 
horse smell be very strong , and he could hear the crunch of grain being grind between strong jaw . 
he find a match in his pocket and light it . 
there were two horse in the barn , a swaybacked dun and person 's buckskin . 
person snuff_out the match . 
it be certain now that person be in the house , but also , presumably , be person . 
person want to get person alone , without interference from anyone , even as spineless a person as the store owner . 
he study the problem for a_few second and think_of a means by which it might be solve . 
reach across the side of the stall , he slap the buckskin on the rump . 
the startled animal let_out a terrified squeal and thrash around in the stall . 
as person had hope , the house door bang open . 
he slap the buckskin again and it kick wildly , its hoof rattle the side of the stall . 
person move_over beside the door and wait . 
presently he hear footstep cross the yard , and person 's smothered curse . 
the door swing open , and person say sourly , `` what the hell 's the_matter with you ? '' 
the horse continue to snort . 
person doubt that any animal belong to person would find much reassurance in its owner 's voice . 
person curse again , and enter the barn . 
a match flare , and he reach above his head to light a lantern which hang from a wire loop . 
as he cross to_the side of the stall , person draw his gun and click back the hammer . 
`` before you try anything '' , he say . 
`` remember what happen to person '' . 
person catch his breath in surprise . 
he start to reach for his gun , but apparently hammer it . 
`` that be the stuff '' , person say . 
`` just hold it that way '' . 
he reach_out to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt . 
`` you and i have a little talk to do , person . 
you won n't be need this '' . 
he move up and lift person 's pistol out of its holster . 
`` damn you , person '' - person was begin to recover from his initial shock . 
`` we ai n't get nothing to talk_about . 
if i do n't come_back in the house , person 's going_to '' - 
`` your trigger-happy brother be n't in the house . 
about now he 's probably have supper . 
that long ride the four of you take must 've give him a good appetite . 
now turn_around so i can see your face '' . 
person turn . 
there was raw fury in his eye , and the vein of his neck be swollen . 
`` you be about as dumb as they come , person . 
i do n't know what you be up_to , but when person '' - 
`` you can forget about person , too '' , person say . 
`` it 's person we 're going_to talk_about '' . 
`` person '' ? 
person stiffen . 
`` i do n't know nothin ' about him '' . 
`` no ? 
i suppose you do n't know anything about a piece of two-by-four , either ; one with blood all_over it , person 's blood '' . 
person 's finger put a_little more pressure on the trigger of his gun . 
`` so help me , person , i 'd like to kill you where you stand , but , before i do , i 'm going_to hear you admit kill him . 
now start talk . 
who tell you to do it ? 
be it person '' ? 
person was hold person 's gun in his left_hand . 
he draw_back his arm to slash the gun_barrel across person 's face , but did n't finish the motion . 
pistol whipping an unarmed man might come easy to someone like person , but person could n't bring_oneself to do it . 
apparently sense this , and realize that it give him an advantage , person become bold . 
`` have all the gun make you a big man , do n't it , person ? 
if we be both armed , you would n't talk so tough '' . 
`` no '' ? 
person reach_out and drop person 's pistol back into the holster . 
he retreat a step and holstered his own . 
`` all_right , crouch ; we be on even terms . 
now draw '' ! 
sweat bubble out on person 's swarthy face . 
the finger of his right_hand twist into a claw , but he did n't reach for the gun . 
person , angry enough to be a_little reckless , raise his hand shoulder high . 
`` does this make it any easy , coward '' ? 
`` i ai n't draw ' against you '' , person say thickly . 
`` i hear how you outdraw person . 
i be n't a gunslinger '' . 
`` no . 
you be the kind of bastard who sneak_up on a man from behind and hit him with a club . 
i just want to hear you say so '' . 
person stare at him without answer and let his hand fall to his side . 
he had find person 's weakness , or what to person be a weakness , and be smart enough to take_advantage of it . 
somewhere in the distance , a woman scream . 
person be too involved in his own problem to pay much attention . 
he had to make person talk , and he had to do it before person get curious and come to investigate . 
once_more he lift person 's gun from its holster , only this time he toss it into the stall with the frightened buckskin . 
he drop his own beside it . 
`` we 'll do it another way , then '' , he say harshly . 
person 's coarse feature twist in a surprised grin which was smash out of shape by person 's fist . 
with a roar of pain and fury person make his attack . 
person manage to duck beneath the man 's flailing fist , and drive home a solid left to person 's midsection . 
it was like hit a sack of salt . 
pain shoot up person 's arm clear to the shoulder , but person seem hardly aware that he had been hit . 
he slam into the wall , bounce back , and catch person with a roundhouse right which send him spin . 
an inch low and it would have knock him out . 
as it was , his vision blur and for a moment he be unable to move . 
when his eye begin to focus , he see person charge at him with a pitchfork . 
person twist to one side , and the tine of the fork bite into the floor . 
person waste a_few second try to yank them loose . 
it give person time to stagger to his foot . 
the tine break_off under person 's twisting , and he swing the handle in an attempt to knock_out person 's brain out . 
his aim be hurried ; so the pitchfork whistle over person 's head . 
by now person was see clearly again . 
he step inside person 's guard and land two blow to the big man 's belly , put everything he have behind them . 
they make person double_over . 
when his head come_down , person grab him by the hair and catapult him head first into the wall . 
the building shake , set the lantern to sway , and the buckskin to pitch again . 
even person 's old crowbait begin to snort , and from the house person yell , `` person ! 
what 's go_on out there '' ? 
person did n't seem too sure himself . 
he lurch drunkenly to his foot , lower his head , and take one step away from the wall . 
person catch him flush on the nose with a blow which start at the floor . 
person had have enough . 
blood gush from his nose , and he back_off as rapidly as he could , stumble over his own foot in his frantic haste to get_away from person 's fist . 
person be in almost as bad shape , but he would n't quit . 
he back person into a corner , grab a handful of the man 's shirtfront , and draw_back his right fist . 
`` tell me about person ! 
you kill him , did n't you '' ? 
`` it be person 's idea '' , person mumble , dab at his nose . 
`` he find_out about you and person talk . 
he want to show the town what happen to anyone who try to start trouble '' . 
`` you mean anyone who stand_up for his right '' , person say . 
he let_go_of the shirt , and person slump to the floor . 
turn his back , person cross to the stall , reach over to untie the buckskin 's halter rope , and wave his hand in the animal 's face . 
the buckskin bolt_out of the stall . 
person move_in and pick_up his gun . 
he shake loose straw out of the action , and place the gun in his holster . 
leave person 's where it lie , he leave the stall . 
`` get_up , person . 
we 're go someplace '' . 
person painfully get to his foot as someone rattle the door . 
`` who 's in there '' ? 
person call fearfully . 
person open the door , grab person by the shoulder , and pull him into the barn . 
`` you 're stay right here for_a_while . 
this dirty coward just admit kill person . 
i 'm going_to let him tell it to somebody else '' . 
he shove person toward the stall , and point his pistol at person . 
`` get_out of here . 
you 're come along peacefully , or i 'll put a bullet in your leg '' . 
person stumble through the door . 
person follow , reach behind him to shut the door and hook it . 
person would have little trouble get_out , but it might delay him a_few minute . 
`` where 're you take ' me '' ? 
person ask worriedly . 
`` we 're go to person 's house . 
maybe if the marshal hear this himself , it 'll make a difference . 
somebody in this town must still have some backbone '' . 
while no larger than location , this mining supply town have the appearance of be far busy and more prosperous . 
man crowd the street and freight rig and team were move about . 
although they were force to maintain a sharp watch , this activity enable them to ride in and rack their bronc without any particular attention being pay them . 
`` person 'll be holdin_'_forth in some bar if he 's here at_all '' , person declare , glance along the street as they stretch their leg . 
there be no less than six or seven saloon in location , not count the lower_class dive , all vie for the trade of celebrate miner and teamster . 
person only nod . 
`` take one side of the street , and i 'll take the other '' , he propose . 
`` if you spot person give a yell before you move_in '' . 
person 's assent be tight . 
`` you do the same . 
it 's all i ask , person '' . 
separate , they take different side of the main_drag and systematically comb the bar . 
person visit two place without result and his blood_pressure be down to zero . 
suddenly it seem to him insane that they might hope to locate person so casually , even were he to prove the thief . 
he tramp out of the location with his hope plummet , and head doggedly for the location , the last place of any consequence on this side of the street . 
the location be an elaborate establishment , build practically on stilt in_front , with long flight of wooden steps run up to the porch . 
behind its ornate facade the notorious dive cling like a bird 's nest to the rocky rib of the canyonside . 
person run up the steps quickly to the plank porch . 
the front window of the place be long and narrow , reach nearly to the floor and afford an unusually good view of the interior . 
head for the batwing , person glance perfunctorily through the near window , and suddenly dodge aside . 
nerve tight as a bowstring , he pause to gather his wit . 
against all expectation , person be inside , clearly enjoy himself to_the_hilt and already so tipsy that it seem unlikely he was bother to note anything or anyone about him . 
fierce anger surge through person . 
he fight_down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious puncher on_the_spot . 
reach the porch rail beyond view of the bar window , he feverishly scan the busy street below . 
person be nowhere in_sight . 
muffle an exclamation , person spring to the near steps and run_down . 
as luck have it , he had not go twenty foot in the street before person appear . 
`` what luck , person '' ? he say swiftly . 
person point upward . 
`` he be there '' , he get_out tersely , curb his rising excitement . 
hitch his cartridge_belt around , person glance upward briefly at the location and start that way with person at his side . 
climb the steps steadily , they reach the top and head for the door . 
person push_through first . 
force behind him momentarily , person follow at_once and halt two step inside . 
his eye widen . 
while five minute ago the place had present a scene of easy revelry , with person a prominent figure , it be now as somnolent and dull as the day before payday . 
person himself be nowhere to be see . 
a man knock_about the roulette_ball about idly in its track , and another doze at one of the card_table . 
two man murmur with their head together at the end of the bar , while the sleek headed bartender absently polish a glass . 
look the setup over , person start coolly for the rear of the place . 
`` where yuh go '' ' ? 
it be the barkeep . 
halt , person turn to survey him deliberately . 
he did not reply , go_on toward the back . 
less assured than the tall , wide shouldered man in_the_lead , person follow alertly , a hand on his gun butt . 
the bartender measure this situation with heavy eye and decide he want no part of it . 
he say no more . 
a hall open in back of the bar , run toward an ell . 
person move_into it . 
small room , probably for cards , open off on either side . 
all the door be open at this hour except one , and it was toward this that person make his way with person close at his shoulder . 
the door be locked . 
a single kick make it spring open , shudder . 
person see person stagger forward , a half filled bottle upraised as if to strike . 
person spring through to bat it nimbly aside . 
with a bellow person lunge at him . 
but he be more_than half drunk , and his faculty be dulled . 
person unleash a single powerful jab that send person reel wildly and crash down with a whining groan . 
he start to struggle up , heave desperately . 
person give him a brutal thrust that tumble him over flat on his stomach . 
kneel , person plant a sturdy knee in the small of his back , hold him pin . 
`` okay , person . 
i 've draw his fangs '' , he snap . 
`` go through his pocket , will you ? 
if we have to we 'll take_apart him apart and see what he 's make of '' ! 
comply methodically , person pull pocket after pocket inside_out without find a thing . 
person watch this with hunted eye , his desperate hope wane by the moment . 
person was grunt over the last empty pocket when person abruptly rise and lunge toward person 's hat , which had tumble half_a_dozen foot away when he first fell . 
person get it . 
straighten_up , his eye ablaze , he hold_out the battered stetson . 
`` look at this '' ! 
inside the crown , stuff behind the stained sweatband , could be see thin , crumpled wads of currency . 
person 's ingenious cache for his loot had been find . 
`` by golly , person ! 
you be right '' , person exclaim , tear the loose bill out of person 's hat . 
`` that_is , if we can be sure this be person 's money '' - 
person grunt . 
`` where else would he get it ? 
count what you 've get there , person . 
we can soon tell '' . 
person run_through the bill and name an amount it be highly unlikely any cowpuncher would come_by honestly . 
person nod . 
`` it be within a_hundred of what person have '' , he declare . 
`` we know person spend some - and person must have drop a_few dollar get that load on '' . 
hand the money over , person wipe his hand on his pant_leg as if rid himself of something unclean . 
his glance at person be disdainful . 
`` shall we get_out of here '' ? 
leave the cardroom , they move_back through the location the way they had come . 
glowering look meet them in the bar , but there be no attempt to halt them . 
pause in the outside_door to glance behind him , person look his unspoken warning and step_out . 
he and person clatter down the high steps to the street . 
neither speak till they reach their horse . 
person pause there , look_across at the young fellow . 
it 'll be a pleasure for you to return this money to person and tell him about it , person `` . 
he start to return it . 
to his faint surprise person hold_up his hand . 
`` not me '' , he rule decidedly . 
i 've have enough . 
it be you that track_down it down anyway , person `` , he pursue strictly . 
'' i 'll shove_along home `` . 
`` whatever you say '' . 
person swing into the saddle , yet still he delay , his brow pucker . 
`` you owe it to person to give her a chance to explain that she was defend you , really '' , he observe mildly . 
`` person was n't '' , retort person tartly . 
`` he 'll know when you tell him . 
but i want this to sink_in awhile . 
then maybe next time he won n't be so quick on the trigger '' . 
`` person had never pretend to give advice in such affairs . 
'' you be the doctor `` , he return with a smile . 
'' but i still think person 's an awful nice girl , person `` - 
`` you do n't have to tell me '' , flash person . 
give the other a dark look , he haul his bronc around and trot down off the street . 
person let him go , follow more leisurely . 
at the first restaurant he sensibly pull_up to go_in for his dinner , and as a consequence did not see person strike the open range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the swell for location . 
the truth be , the puncher be both bewildered and dismayed by his own mixed luck . 
`` person 's always glad to see me over there '' , he muse bleakly . 
yet had he not visit the girl at location he would never have be involve in this latest tangle . 
over and above that , however , be his growing suspicion of person 's part in recent event . 
`` person could n't have know about person 's money unless he was tell - and who else would have tell him '' ? he ask himself . 
`` it be the second time war_ax hands make a play for that money . 
how much of an accident could that be `` ? 
near home , he jerk to attention at the distant crack of a gun . 
in town no one pay much attention to an occasional shot ; but on the range gunfire have a meaning . 
haul_up , person listen carefully . 
two minute later it come again - a double explosion , follow by a third , sound more distant . 
as_near_as person could determine the shot come from the direction of the location ranch_house . 
he tighten_up in a twinkling . 
so_far_as he know , only his father could be there . 
what did it mean ? 
clap spur to the bronc he set_off at a sharp canter , with growing alarm . 
his first glimpse of the ranch_house across the brushy swell tell him nothing . 
still a quarter_mile away , the fresh clap of gun only serve to increase his speed . 
set a course straight for the house , he was cover ground fast when an angry bee buzz past close to his face . 
when it was follow by a second , whine even closer , person swerve sharply aside into a depression . 
he know now what he be up against . 
whoever be out there hide in the brushy cover was besiege the location house and , having spot his approach , be determined to drive him off before he could get_into the fight . 
curse himself for having ride out the last few day without a rifle in his saddle boot , person draw his colt and examine it briefly . 
if he wonder whether the attacker would allow him to pull away unmolested , he have his answer a moment later . 
`` over this way ! 
he ai n't go far '' ! a harsh cry float to him across the brush . 
a carbine crack more loudly , and a slug clip fragment from the brush off at one side . 
the would-be assassin had his position figure pretty close . 
dismount , person look about hastily . 
toward the west this depression lead toward a draw . 
lead his pony , he hurry that way , not remount till he be well below the level of the surrounding range . 
swing up then , and bend forward over the horn , he urge his mount down the meandering draw . 
he had not cover a_hundred yard before a gun crash from somewhere behind . 
he had been sight , and his attacker pump shot after shot . 
a shot or two go wild before person feel something tug at his foot . 
a slug had tear half of his stirrup guard away . 
a second twitch his shirtsleeve , and he feel a brief burn on his upper arm . 
another snarl close overhead . 
`` jumping_jerusalem ! 
let 's get_out of here '' ! 
at the first shot person had hurl his mount to the left toward the side of the winding draw . 
the long minute before he reach effective cover seem endless . 
sweeping a look around , he see that he be safe for_the_moment . 
he hear cry from behind him , but he could make_out no words . 
he dash madly for the next elbow turn in the draw , and make_it . 
recklessly hurl the bronc sidewise into an intersecting draw , he plunge forward with undiminished speed . 
gradually the wash climb upward , force him toward open range . 
yet he must chance it . 
he clamber out of the dwindling wash , the loose dirt fly behind him , and flash a look about . 
early in november the cloud lift enough to carry_out the assigned mission . 
and sweeney_squadron put its first mark on the combat record . 
every plane that could fly was send into the air . 
person take eight ship and go south across the location and along the north coast of location to location . 
anything the enemy fly or float be his target . 
person with eight was to patrol the location area , with his main task to get any kamikaze before they get to the ship . 
person himself take two flight , with person lead the second , to patrol and look_for target of opportunity around location on the east coast of location . 
each plane carry two five_hundred pound bomb . 
a weapons_carrier take person , person , person , person , and person and the others the two mile from the bivouac area to the strip . 
it be a rough long ride through the mud and pothole . 
no one have much to say . 
the sky glower down at them . 
there was a feeling that this mission would be cancel like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go_on forever . 
the truck drop them off at the various revetment spread through the jungle . 
person snatch person 's chute from him with a belligerent motion and almost run to the plane with_it . 
his face be dark as the sky above it as he stand on the wing and wait for his pilot . 
person climb into the cockpit feel as if he had never be in one before . 
but his hand and those of person move automatically adjust and arrange in the checkout procedure . 
`` i 've get her as neat as i can '' , person say , as he drop the strap of the seton harness over person 's shoulder . 
`` but this goddamn climate . 
it be for carabao not airplane '' . 
`` we 'll make_out . 
do n't you worry , chief '' , person reply , wonder if he himself believe it . 
`` yeah . 
see_you '' , person say as he jump off the wing . 
the expression be his trademark , his open_sesame to good_luck , and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return . 
at the prearranged time , person start the engine and taxi out . 
from the time the chock were pull until the plane be out_of_sight , he know person would keep his back to the strip . 
he wonder where the superstition had originate that it be bad_luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take_off on a combat_mission . 
yet long before the scheduled time for return , person would be watch for every speck in the sky . 
person rumble down the rough metal taxi_strip , and one_by_one the seven member of his flight fall_in behind him . 
the dark brown bomb hang under each wing look large and powerful . 
the pilot ' head look ridiculously small . 
the control_tower give him immediate takeoff permission , and the clean roar of the engine that take_off him off the rough strip speak well of the skill of person . 
person 's mission be the last to leave , and as he circle the ship off location he see the cloud were drop_down again . 
to the west , the dark green hills of location were lose in the cloud about halfway up their slope . 
underneath him the sea be a dark and muddied gray . 
water splash against his windshield as he lead the flight in and out of shower . 
the metal strip they had take_off from be coal-black against the green jungle around it . 
he possess the fighter pilot 's horror of bad_weather and instrument_flying , and he wonder , if the ceiling did drop , whether he and the other flight would be able to find their way back in_this unfamiliar territory . 
he shiver in the warm cockpit . 
the overcast be solid above him . 
as far as he could see there was no hole to climb through it . 
they would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separate location from location and hope that it did n't close_in before they return . 
location push the radio button on his throttle . 
`` person , let 's try to go under this stuff . 
stay in close and we 'll go up the valley '' . 
`` roger , person '' , person call back , and pull his four in and slightly above person . 
person take the formation wide around three a-26 attack bomber that be headed north over the location . 
he drop_down to five_hundred foot , swing a_little north of the city of location , and punch into the opening that show against the mountain . 
the valley be only a_few hundred yard wide with just_about room enough for a properly perform hundred-and-eighty degree turn . 
it be only a fifteen minute flight , but before it be through person feel himself develop a case of claustrophobia . 
the ceiling stay solid above them at about eight hundred foot , and at_times the sheer cliff seem about to close_in . 
if the other pilot be worried , they did not show it . 
the formation remain perfect . 
when the sea be visible ahead of them , the relief be as great as if the sun had come_out . 
he spread_out the flight out and lead them across a point of land and_then down the coast . 
although they draw light ground fire they see no sign of activity . 
once person think he had spot a tank and go_down to investigate while person cover him . 
`` somebody beat us to_it '' ! 
person say over the radio as he come_back up in formation . 
visibility continue to be limited , and person be never able to get above a_thousand foot . 
it be frustrating . 
his earphone be constantly full of the sound of enemy contact make by other flight . 
he think once that he identify the somewhat hysterical voice of person claim a kill . 
but person 's area remain as placid as a florida dawn . 
finally , as time begin to run_out , he head into location and glide-bomb a group of house that intelligence had think might contain japanese supplies . 
the low cloud make bombing difficult . 
there was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run . 
the accuracy be deplorable . 
one of person 's bomb hang_up , and he be mile from the target before he could get_rid_of it . 
only one of the flight score a direct hit and the rest blow_up jungle . 
with their load of bomb gone , the plane move swiftly and easily . 
person go_up tight against the ceiling and lead them back to their pass to home . 
mercifully , it be still open . 
like a man make a deep dive , person take_a_breath full breath and plunge back into the valley . 
he be about to make a gas check on his flight when person 's voice break_in : `` person ! 
three bogy . 
twelve o'clock level '' . 
person 's eye flick up from his instrument_panel . 
he see them , speck against the gray , but close_in fast . 
they be headed straight for each other on a collision course . 
friend or enemy ? 
the same old question . 
and only a_few second to answer it . 
`` zeros '' ! 
person say excitedly , and hopefully . 
and_then he think person might be right . 
his mind flick through the mental_picture he have from the hours of aircraft_identification . 
he narrow_down the shape down to two : either a zero or a group type aircraft . 
if it be the enemy , tactically his position be correct . 
japanese aircraft be strong on maneuverability , american on speed and firepower . 
his present maximum altitude , up against the overcast , give him the opportunity to exploit his advantage . 
but it also make him conspicuous to the enemy , if it be the enemy , and he had n't been spot already . 
but the close_in aircraft show no sign of deviate from their original course . 
in second , person make his decision . 
he push the radio button . 
`` person , hit_the_deck . 
lots of throttle . 
person , you take_on the one on the left . 
i 'll take_on the middle . 
person , the one on the right . 
if & & & if they be jap . 
let 's make sure first '' . 
person have the stick forward and the throttle up before he hear the two `` rogers '' . 
the plane , light with most of the gas burn out , respond beautifully . 
person 's airspeed indicator be over 350 when he level_off just above the tree . 
the opposing aircraft continue to come_on . 
they appear to be the enemy . 
person wish the air_corps had continue to camouflage plane . 
there was , of_course , no way for the other plane to get_by them . 
it be a box . 
but they could turn and escape to the east . 
person push the radio button again . 
`` person , drop_back your second element back . 
if any of us miss , they can pick_up the pieces . 
now let 's make sure they be jap '' . 
even as he say it , person know they had find the enemy . 
the shape be unmistakable and the rising sun were show_up , slightly bright pinpoint in the gray gloom . 
person slap his hand across the switch that turn_on the gun and gun camera and gun sight . 
the circle with the dot in the center show_up yellow on the reflector glass in_front of him . 
his hand shake . 
`` arm your gun , person '' . 
`` they be jap . 
they be jap '' , come a high-pitched voice . 
`` person to person . 
one pass only . 
no turn . 
you 'll bust_your_ass in_this canyon . 
that be an order '' . 
he move the flight over against one wall . 
it give them all a chance to make a high-speed climb turn attack and a breakaway that would not take them into the overcast or force a tight turn recovery . 
if the turn be too tight , a barrel_roll would bring_out them out . 
a hell of an altitude for a barrel_roll , but it could be do . 
person slam his throttle to the firewall and ram up the rpm , and the engine respond as if it had been wait . 
the clearly identifiable enemy continue on as if no one else be around . 
`` they have n't see us '' , person yell to himself over the engine noise . 
`` they have n't see us '' . 
he hit the radio button . 
`` now , person , now . 
let 's take ' em home '' . 
he haul back on the stick and feel his cheek sag . 
out of the corner of his eye , he watch his wingman move out a_bit and shoot_up with him . 
perfect , he think . 
with the rapid rate of closure , the approach from below , the side , and ahead , there would be only a moment when damage could be do . 
just like shoot at a duck while perform a half_gainer from a diving_board . 
he tighten his turn . 
his nose up . 
it was going_to be dangerous . 
eight aircraft in_this small box . 
please , dear god , make my pilot good , he pray . 
he take a lead on the enemy , use a distance of five of the radius in his circular sight and_then add another . 
the enemy did not veer . 
it did not seem possible that they had n't been spot . 
blind fool . 
now ! 
person 's finger close on the stick trigger . 
the plane rumble and slow . 
six red line etch their way into the gray and vanish . 
as if draw by a wire the enemy fly into them . 
person tighten his turn until the plane shudder . 
luck be with him . 
his burst hold for a second on the engine section of the plane . 
the jap 's propeller fly off in piece . 
a large piece of engine cowling vanish . 
it was all person have time to see . 
his maneuvering for the shot had place him near the overcast , almost inverted and head_up into the cloud . 
his speed was drop rapidly . 
if he spin out now , he would join his opponent on the ground . 
wingman , stay clear , he pray . 
he push stick and rudder and enter the overcast on his back . 
he fight the panic of vertigo . 
he have no idea which be up and which be down . 
he hold the control where they had be . 
sweat pop_out over him and he feel the slick between his palm and the stick grip . 
his airspeed drop until he think he would spin out . 
over the rattling of fender , humming of tire and chattering of gear there be a charming melody of whisper and tiny giggle . 
cool air move slowly through the open or smashed out side window hint of blooming roadside vegetation , and occasionally a faint fragrance of perfume swirl from the back seat . 
`` person '' , my driver suddenly exclaim with something so definite , so final in his tone i once_more repeat the absurdity , muster all my latent power of hypocrisy to sound convinced . 
we were come to an intersection , turn right , chuff to a stop . 
force to realize that this be the end of a very short line i scan a road marker and discover what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old person : location , new_mexico . 
`` gracias . 
adios '' , i say , exhaust my spanish vocabulary on my host and exchange one of a scarcely tap store of smile with my host 's daughter . 
i wave with discretion and moderation to the vague golden face fade through rise dust and the distortion of the back window glass . 
then i see the father 's head slightly turn ; gauche rainbow shape replace the poignant oval of gold . 
auto whiz past . 
white shirt and conservatively cravated driver stare conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my supplicate and accusing gaze . 
suddenly a treble auto horn tootley-toot-tootled , and , thumb hopefully , i see emergent in windshield flash : red lip , streaming silk of blonde hair and - ah , trembling confusion of hope , apprehension , despair - the leering face of old person . 
`` mor-ee-air-teeeee '' , he shriek , his white tooth grossly counterpoint those of the glittering blonde . 
over the rapidly diminishing outline of a jump_seat pile high with luggage person 's black brush_cut be just discernible , near , or enviably near that spot where - hidden - more delicately textured , most beautifully tinted hair must still be stream back in cool , oh cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca flower and engine fumes . 
damn his luck . 
i would have forgo my romantic chance rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty and - well , at_least i would n't have shout back a taunt . 
still nurse anger i listlessly thumb a car that was slowly approach , its prewar chrome nearly blind me . 
it was stop . 
just as i straighten_up with my duffel_bag , i hear : `` person , meet person '' . 
the voice be that of person , tail gunner off another crew . 
squeeze a look between person 's fat jowl and the car frame a handsome and still dark-haired lady inquire `` y_'_all_drahve '' ? 
i nod . 
`` onleh_one_thiihng '' , person continue . 
`` ahm go north t ' join mah husband in location , an_y ' all maht prefer the southern route . 
but person has already say it didn_make_no diffrunce_t '_hi-im '' . 
i say that it did n't make any difference to me either , as far as i know . 
how far i know will shortly become apparent . 
let me pass_over the trip to location with something of the same speed which make person `` wonder if the wahtahm speed_limit '' ( 35 mph . ) `` be still in effect '' . 
i let_up on the accelerator , only to gradually reach again the 60 mph which would , i hope , overhaul person and the blonde , and as there were car whose driver apparently have something more important to catch than had i , person settle_down to practice on person the kittenish wile she would need when make her duty call on colonel and mrs somebody in location . 
when person ejaculate `` howsabout my buying us all a nice cold coca_cola , ma'am '' ? 
person smilingly decline and begin suddenly to go_on about her son , who be `` only a_little younger than you boy '' . 
person never would have believe she have a son that age . 
person think person be a `` sweet boy t ' lie lahk thet '' , but her person was get_to be a man , there was no get_around it . 
`` just before he leave foh his academy we wuh have daiquiri on the veranda , person an ah , an person say ' may ah have one too ' ? 
just_as polite an - an confident , an ah say ' of_course you can n't ' , but he say ' whah not , you ah have one ' ? 
an ah coudn answer him an so ah say ' all_right , ah guess , an his father did not utter one word an after person be gone , the major laugh an tell me thet he an the boy had been have an occasional drink together f ' over a year , only an occasional one , but just the same it be behind mah back , an ah doa not think thet be nice at_all , d ' you '' ? 
`` no , i do n't '' , person say . 
`` i be a good baptist , and drinking & & & '' . 
person very kindly let me drive through sante_fe to a road which would , she say , lead us to location and_then location and `` eventually '' out of new_mexico . 
how lightly her `` eventually '' passed_into_the_crannies where i was store dialect material for some vaguely dreamed opus , and how the word would echo . 
and reecho . 
hardly had person drive off when a rusty pickup truck , father or grandfather of senor `` person 's '' ford sedan , come screech to a dust swirling stop , and a brown face appear , its nose threaten by shard of_what had once be the side window . 
`` get_in , buddy . 
get_in '' . 
the straight , black hair flop in a vigorous nod , the slender nose plunge toward glass tooth and draw safely back . 
person unwire the right-hand door , whose window be , like the left one , merely loosely taped fragment of glass , and person wad himself into a narrow seat make still more narrow by three case of beer . 
`` in back , buddy '' , the driver say to me . 
quickly but carefully lower my duffel_bag over the low side rack , i step_on the running_board ; it flop down , spring back up and gouge my shin . 
the truck was hurtle forward . 
i seize the rack and make a western style flying mount just_in_time , one of my knee mercifully land on my duffel_bag - and merely wreck my camera , i was to discover later - my other knee land on the slivery truck floor_board and - but this be no medical_report . 
i be again in motion and at a speed which belie the truck 's similarity to person 's ford turtle . 
maybe i would beat old person to siberia after_all . 
whatever satisfaction that might offer . 
something pull my leg . 
i draw_back , draw_back my foot for a kick . 
but it be only person reach around the wire chicken fencing , which half cover the truck cab 's glassless rear_window . 
the way his red rubbery lip were stretch across his pearly little tooth i though he was only have a little joke , but , no , he want me to bend down from the roar of wind so he could roar something into my ear . 
`` wanna beer '' ? 
`` hell , yes '' , i roar back between dusty lip . 
did i want a beer ? 
did an anteater want ant ? 
`` bueno , amigo . 
gracias '' , i holler , my first long swallow fill me with confidence and immediately double the size of my spanish vocabulary . 
at_once my ear were drown by a flow of what i take_to_be spanish , but - the driver 's white tooth flash at me , the road wildly veer beyond his glistening hair , beyond his gesticulating bottle - it could have be the pure oxford_english i was half hear ; i would n't have know the difference . 
person was try to grab the wheel , though the swerve of the truck was throw him away from_it . 
white tooth suddenly vanish , the driver slam the side of his bottle against person 's ear . 
we be off the road , gleaming barbed_wire pull taut . 
i duck just as the first strand break somewhere down the line and come whip over the sideboard . 
we be in a field , in a tight , screeching turn . 
prairie_dog were pop_up and pop down . 
when i fall on my back , i see a vulture hover . 
just as i get to my knee , there was again the sound of the fence stretch , and i have time only to start take my kneeling posture seriously . 
this time no wire come whip into the truck . 
we be back on the road . 
i regain my squatting position behind the truck cab 's rear_window . 
person 's left_hand was press against the side of his head , red cheek whiten beneath his finger . 
`` tee-wah '' , the driver cackle , his black eye glitter behind dull silver chicken fencing . 
`` that be tee-wah i was talk . 
you think i be a mexican , did n't you , buddy '' ? 
i nod . 
`` hell , that 's all_right , buddy '' , the indian ( i now guess ) say . 
`` drink your beer '' . 
miraculously , the bottle be still in my hand , foam still geyser over my ( luckily ) waterproof watch . 
no sooner had i start drink than the driver start zigzag the truck . 
the beer foam furiously . 
i drink furiously . 
a long time . 
empty the bottle . 
tooth again flash back at me , the driver release a deluge of spanish in which `` amigo '' appear every_so_often like an island in the stormy wave of surrounding sound . 
i bob my head each time it appear . 
suddenly the spanish become an english in which only one word emerge with clarity and precision , `` son_of_a_bitch '' , sometimes hyphenated by vicious jab of a beer_bottle into person 's quivering rib . 
a big car was approach , its chrome tooth grinning . 
beyond it the gray road stretch a long , long way . 
the car be just about to us , its driver 's fat , solemn face intent on the road ahead , on business , on a family in location - on anything but an old pickup truck in which two human_being desperately need rescue . 
i toss the bottle . 
high , so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the car 's steel roof . 
too high . 
on unoccupied roadway the bottle shatter into a small amber flash . 
`` aye-yah-ah-ah '' ! 
the indian was again raise his bottle , but to my astonished relief - probably only a fraction of person 's - the bottle this time go to the indian 's lip . 
another car was come , a tiny , dark shape on a far hill . 
i start look on the splintery truck_bed for a piece of board , a dirt clod - anything i could throw and with better aim than i had throw the beer_bottle . 
we were slow . 
in the ditch sand be white and soft looking , only an occasional pebble discernible , faintly gleaming . 
but person could n't quickly unwire the truck door , and if i escape , he might suffer . 
the car was approach fast . 
on the truck_bed there was nothing small than a piece of rusty machinery ; with more time i could have loosen a small burr or cotter_pin - 
suddenly and not a second too soon i think_of the coin in my pocket . 
there was no time to pick_out a penny ; i get a coin between my thumb and forefinger , lean my elbow in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck cab and flip my little missile . 
there was a blur just under my focus of vision , a crash ; the car 's far windshield panel turn_into a silver web with a dark hole in_the center . 
i hear the screech of brakes behind me , an insane burst of laughter beneath me . 
look_back i see a gray-haired man get_out of his halted car and try to read our license_number . 
`` person '' . 
person 's fat hand , another bottle were protrude from the truck cab , and that self proclaimed baptist teetotaler , have a bottle at his own lip . 
two car come over a crest , their chrome and glass flash . 
the indian 's arm whip sidewise - there was a flash of amber and froth , the crash of the bottle shatter against the side of the first car . 
brakes shriek behind us . 
i see person 's bottle snatch from his hand , see it go in a swirl of foam just behind the second car . 
this time there was no sound of brakes but the shrieking of woman . 
i look_back at pale oval frame in the elongated oval of the car 's rear_window . 
`` drink , you son_of_a_bitch '' ! 
i quickly turn_around and begin to drink . 
but the indian was jab another bottle toward person . 
i guide her to the divan , turn_off the tv , face her . 
she sit quietly , stare at me from the wide eye . 
and what eye they be . 
big and dark , a melting , golden brown . 
eye like hot honey , eye that sizzled . 
plus flawless skin , smooth brow and cheek , lip that look as if you could get a shock from them . 
it be a disturbingly familiar face , too , but i could n't remember where we had meet . 
i say , `` do we know each other , miss '' ? 
`` no , i remember read about you in the paper and that you live here , and when it happen all i could think_of was - '' . 
this time she stop the rush of words herself . 
`` i 'm sorry . 
shall i go_on '' ? 
she smile . 
it was her first smile . 
but worth wait for . 
`` sure '' . 
i say . 
`` but one word at_a_time , o._k . '' ? 
she was still hug the stained coat around her , so i say , `` relax , let me take your things . 
would you like a drink , or coffee '' ? 
`` no , thanks '' . 
she stand_up , pull the coat from her shoulder and start to slide it off , then let_out a high-pitched scream and i let_out a low-pitched , wobbling sound like a muffler blow_out . 
she was wear nothing beneath the coat . 
she jerk the coat back on and squeeze it around her again , but not soon_enough . 
there had be a good second or two during which my muffler had been blow_out , and now i be certain i 'd see her somewhere before . 
`` i forget '' ! she yelp . 
`` oh , do forgive me . 
i 'm sorry '' ! 
`` i forgive - '' . 
`` that 's what start all the trouble in_the_first_place . 
oh , dear , i 'm all unstrung '' . 
`` you and me both , dear . 
have n't we & & & have n't i see you & & & . 
i mean , surely we 've - '' . 
`` you may have see me on tv '' , she say . 
`` i 've do several filmed commercial for - '' . 
then it hit me . 
`` zing '' ! 
i cry . 
`` why , yes . 
and you recognize me '' ? 
`` yes , indeed . 
in_fact , i was watch you on_that little seventeen inch screen when you ring my bell . 
man , you ring - it be in_color , too , miss , and & & & miss ? 
what 's your name , anyway ? 
ah , you be splendid '' . 
i sit by her on the divan . 
`` splendid . 
in a waterfall and all that '' . 
`` that 's the last one we do . 
that be a fun one '' . 
`` i 'll bet . 
it be fun for me , all_right . 
i do n't mean to pry , but do they hide the swimsuit with the bubble ? 
i mean : is advertising honest ? 
`` it depend_on who do it . 
i never wear anything at_all . 
it would n't - would n't seem fair , somehow '' . 
`` i could n't agree with you more '' . 
`` i really do have something important to tell you , person . 
about the murder '' . 
`` murder ? 
oh , yeah '' , i say . 
`` tell me about the murder '' . 
she tell me . 
zing be the creation of two man , person and person , partner in group ! 
, inc. . 
they 'd peddle the soap virtually alone , and without much success , until about a year ago , when - with the addition of `` sx-21 '' to their secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising_campaign - sale had soar practically into orbit . 
their product had been endorse by good_housekeeping , the a._m._a. , and the veterinary_journal , among other repository of high wisdom , and before much longer if you did n't have a cake of their soap in the john , even your best friend would think you did n't bathe . 
my lovely caller - person be her name - had previously do three filmed commercial for zing , and this_evening , the fourth , a super production , had been film at the home of person . 
the water in person 's big swimming_pool had been cover with a blanket of thick , foamy soapsuds - fashion , of_course , from zing - person had dive from the board into the pool , then swirl and cavort in her luxurious `` bath '' while camera roll . 
the finished - and drastically cut - product would begin with a hazy longshot of person enter the suds , then burst above the pool 's surface clothe in layer of lavender lather , and i have a hunch this item was going_to sell tons and tons of soap ; even to clean man and boy . 
person go_on , `` when we 'd finish , person - person - ask me to stay a_little longer . 
he want a_few still for magazine ad , he say . 
everybody leave and i stay in the pool , then person come_back alone and leap into the pool too . 
and he did n't have_on any clothes on '' . 
`` he did n't '' ! 
`` yes , he did n't . 
did , i mean '' . 
she pause . 
`` did leap into the pool , and did n't have_on anything on . 
anyway , it be evident what he have_in_mind '' . 
`` you get_away , did n't you '' ? 
`` yes . 
he catch_up_with me once and grab me , but i be all covered with zing - it 's very slippery , you know '' . 
`` i did n't know . 
i would n't have the stuff in the house . 
but i 'm pleased to hear - '' . 
`` so i just scoot out of his clutches . 
i swim like_mad , get_out of the pool , grab my robe , and run to the car . 
the key be still in it , and i be mile away before i remember that my clothes and purse and everything be still in the little cabana where i 'd change '' . 
she 'd drive_around for_a_while , person say , then , think person would have calm_down by that time , she 'd go_back to his home on location , park in_front , and walk toward the pool . 
while several yard from_it , still concealed by the shrubbery , she 'd see two man on her left at the pool 's edge . 
she go_on : 
`` a man was hold onto person , hold him up . 
maybe person be only unconscious , but right then i think he must be dead . 
the man shove him into the water , then run past the cabana . 
there 's a walk there that go out to location . 
i be so scared , well , i just run to my car and come here '' . 
`` you know who the other man be '' ? 
`` no , i never did see his face . 
i did n't get_a_look a good look at him at_all , his back be to me , and i be so scared . 
it be just somebody in a man 's suit . 
but i 'm sure the other one be person '' . 
what person want me to do was go_to person 's house and `` do whatever detective do '' , and get her clothes - and handbag contain her identification . 
she realize i 'd have_to notify the police , but fervently hope i could avoid mention her name . 
her impact in the zing commercial had lead to her being consider for an excellent part in an upcoming tv series , underwater_western_eye , a documentary type show to be sponsor by oatnut_grits . 
but if person get involved in murder or salacious scandal , the role would probably go to the sponsor 's wife , person . 
or at_least not to person . 
`` and i so want the part '' , she say . 
`` the commercial have just be for money , there has n't be any real incentive for me to do them , but in underwater_western_eye i 'd have a chance to act . 
i could show what i can do '' . 
as_far_as i be concerned , she had already and had dandily show what she could do . 
but i promise person i would mention her name , if at_all , only as a last_resort . 
seem much relieved , she smile one of those worth wait for smile , and i smile all_the_way into the bedroom . 
there i get my group special and shoulder harness , slip_on my coat on , and go_back into the front_room . 
person squirm a_little on the divan . 
`` i 'm start to itch '' , she say . 
`` itch '' ? 
`` yes , i 'm still all covered with that soap . 
i be loaded with suds when i run_away , and i have n't have a chance to wash it off . 
mmmm , it sure itch '' . 
`` you might as_well wait here while i 'm gone , so you can use my shower if you 'd like '' . 
`` oh , i 'd love to '' . 
i show her the shower and tub , and she say , smile , `` if you really do n't mind , i think i 'll get clean in the shower , then soak for a_few minute in your tub . 
that always relax me . 
does n't it you '' ? 
`` only when i do it '' . 
i shake my head . 
one of my virtue or vice be a sort_of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound_effect and glorious living color . 
`` soak as_long_as you want , person . 
it 'll probably be at_least an hour or two before i can check back with you . 
so you 'll have everything all to yourself , doggone '' . 
i look at my watch . 
ten after nine . 
time to go , i suppose . 
`` well , good-bye '' , i say . 
`` good-bye . 
you 'd had_better hurry '' . 
`` oh , you can count_on that '' . 
she smile slightly . 
softly . 
warmly . 
`` do n't hurry too_much . 
i 'll be soak for at_least half an hour '' . 
that be all she say . 
but suddenly those hot honey eye seem to have everything but swarm of bee in them . 
however , when there 's a job to be do , i 'm a monstrosity of grim determination , i like to think . 
i spin about and clatter through the front_room to the door . 
as i go_out , i could hear water pour in the shower . 
hot water . 
she would n't be take a cold shower . 
hell , she could n't . 
location be only two or three mile from the group , and it take me less_than five minute to get there . 
but the scene be not the quiet , calm scene i 'd expect . 
four car were park at the curb , and two of them be police radio car . 
light blaze in the big house and surrounding grounds . 
i follow a shrubbery lined gravel path alongside the house to the pool . 
two uniformed officer , a_couple_of plainclothesman i know , and two other man stand on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left . 
at the pool 's far end be the little cabana person had mention , and on the water 's surface float scattered lavender patch of limp look lather . 
a_few yard beyond the group of man , a man 's nude body lie face down on a patch of thick green dichondra . 
person , one of the plainclothesman , spot me and say , `` hi , person '' , and walk toward me . 
`` how 'd you hear about this one '' ? 
i grin , but ignore the question . 
he did n't push it ; person work out of location and we 'd be friend for year . 
he fill_in me in . 
a call to the police had been place from here a_couple_of minute after nine p.m. , and the first police_car had arrive two or three minute after_that - 10 minute ago now . 
present at the scene - in_addition to the dead man , who be indeed person - had be person 's partner person , and person , an advertising_agency executive who handle the zing account . 
neither of them , i understand , had be present at the filming session earlier . 
`` what were they do here '' ? 
i ask person . 
`` they were supposed to meet person at nine p.m. for a conference concern the ad_campaign for their soap , a new angle base on this sx-21 stuff '' . 
`` yeah , i 've hear more about sx-21 than space exploration lately . 
what be the gunk '' ? 
`` how would i know ? 
it 's a secret . 
that be the new advertising angle - something about a group policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient . 
actually , only two man know what the formula be , person and '' - he stop and look at person 's body . 
i say , `` o._k. , so now only person know . 
how 's it strike you , foul or fair '' ? 
`` ca n't say yet . 
deputy coroner say it look like he suck_in a big pile of those thick suds and strangle on ' em . 
the pm might show he drown instead , but that 's what the once-over-lightly give us . 
accident , murder , suicide - take your pick '' . 
`` i 'll pick murder . 
anything else '' ? 
`` according to person , he arrive here a couple minute before nine and spot person in the water , get a hooked pole from the pool equipment locker and start haul him out . 
they be west of the sabine , but_only_god_knew_where . 
for three day , their stolid oxen had plod up a blazing valley as flat and featureless as a dead sea . 
molten glare singe their eyelid an angry crimson ; suffocating air sap their strength and strain their nerves to snap ; dust choke their throat and lie like acid in their lung . 
and the valley stretch_out endlessly out ahead , scorched and baked and writhing in its heat , until it vanish into the throb wall of fiery orange brown haze . 
person extend his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the nose of the oxen . 
`` hoa-whup '' ! he command from his raw throat , and feel the pain of movement in his cracked , black burned lip . 
he remove his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulet through the dust film upon his gaunt face . 
he spit . 
the dust thick saliva come from his mouth like balled cotton . 
he move back to the wheel and stand there blow , grasp the top of a spoke to still the trembling of his played_out limb . 
the burning air dry his sweat soaked clothes in salt edged patch . 
he clear his throat and wet his lip . 
as cheerfully as possible , he say , `` well , i guess we could all do with a little drink '' . 
he unlash the dipper and draw water from a barrel . 
they could no_longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat_bag that cool it by evaporation . 
the water be warm and stale and have a brackish taste . 
but it be water . 
thank_the_lord , they still have water ! 
he cleanse his mouth with a small quantity . 
he took a long but carefully controlled draught . 
he replenish the dipper and hand it to his young wife ride the hurricane_deck . 
she take it grudgingly , her dark eye baleful as they meet his . 
she drink and push back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and wipe her face . 
she set the dipper on the edge of the deck , leave it for him to stretch after it while she look_on scornfully . 
`` what happen when there be no more water '' ? she ask smolderingly . 
she be like charcoal , he think - dark , opaque , explosive . 
her thick hair be the color and texture of charcoal . 
her temper spark like charcoal when it first light_up . 
and all_the_time , she have the heat of hatred in her , like charcoal that is burn on its underside , but not visibly . 
a ripple run through the muscle of his jaw , but he keep control upon his voice . 
`` there must be some water under there '' . 
he tilt his homely face toward the dry bed of the river . 
`` we can get it if we dig '' , he say patiently . 
`` and add fever to our trouble '' ? she scoff . 
`` or do you want to see if i can stand fever , too '' ? 
`` we can boil it '' , he say . 
her chin sharpen . 
`` we be lost and burn_up already '' , she bite_out tensely . 
`` the tire are rattle on the wheel now . 
they 'll roll off in another day . 
there be no valley like this on your map . 
you do n't even know where we be headed . 
`` person '' , he say as gently as he could , `` we be still headed west . 
somewhere , we 'll hit a trail '' . 
`` somewhere ! '' she repeat . 
`` maybe in_time to make a cross and dig our grave '' . 
his wide mouth compress . 
in_a_way , he could n't blame her . 
he had pick_out this pathless trail , instead of the common one , in a moment of romantic fancy , to give them privacy on their honeymoon . 
it had be a mistake , but anything would have be a mistake , as it turn_out . 
it be n't the roughness and crudity and discomfort of the trip that had frighten her . 
she had hate the whole idea before they start . 
actually , she had hate him before she ever see him . 
it had been five day too late before he learn that she 'd go_through the wedding_ceremony in a semitrance of laudanum , administer by her mother . 
the bitterness of their wedding_night still rip within him like an open wound . 
she had jump away from his shy touch like a cat confront by a sidewinder . 
he had leave her inviolate , think familiarity would gentle her in_time . 
but each mile westward , she had hate him the deeply . 
he stare at the dipper , turn it over_and_over in his wide , calloused hand . 
`` i suppose '' , he mutter , `` i can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to your folk , once we find a settlement '' . 
`` do n't try to be noble '' ! 
her laugh be hard . 
`` they would n't have sell me in_the_first_place if there 'd be food enough to go_around '' . 
he wince . 
`` person , they did n't sell you '' , he say miserably . 
`` they know i be a good sharecrop_farmer back in location , but out west be a chance to build a real farm of_our_own . 
they think it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be think any better than the next except for just what be inside of them . 
without money or property , what would you have have at baton_rouge '' ? 
`` i might have starve , but at_least i would n't be fry to a crisp and soaked with dirt '' ! 
he darken under his heavy burn . 
his blue eye seek the shimmering sea of haze ahead . 
to his puzzlement , there suddenly be no haze . 
the valley lie clear , and open to the eye , right up to the sharp-limbed line of gaunt , scoured hills that form the horizon twenty mile ahead . 
then he notice the cloud race upon them - heavy , ominous , leaden cloud that form even as they slice over the crest of the surrounding hills . 
he had never see cloud like them before , but he have the primitive feel of danger that grip a man before a hurricane in location . 
he holler hoarsely , `` hang_on '' ! and goad the oxen as he yell . 
he wanted to turn them , put the wagon against the storm . 
too late , he realize that in turning , he had wheel them onto a patch of sandy ground , instead of atop a grade or ridge . 
he swing up over the wheel . 
`` you had_better get inside '' , he warn her . 
but she sit on in stubborn silence . 
the cloud bulge downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel . 
frozen , they stare at it whirl down the valley , gouge and spit_out boulder and chunk of earth like a starving hound_dog crack marrowbone . 
the six ton conestoga_wagon begin to whip and shake . 
their world turn black . 
it was fill with dust and wind and sound and violence . 
the heavens open , pelt them with hail the size of walnut . 
and_then come the water - not rain , but solid sheet that sluice down like water slop from a bucket . 
wall of water rush down the slope and fill the hollow like the crest of flash_flood . 
through the splash of the rise water , they could hear the roar of the river as it rage through its canyon , gnash big chunk out of the bank . 
the jetting , frothing surface of the river reach the level of the runoff . 
the dangerous current upon the prairie cease , but the water stand and keep_on rise . 
they cringe under sodden cover , listen to the wave slop against the bottom . 
the cloudburst cut_off abruptly . 
they were engulf by the weird silence , break only by the low , angry murmur of the river . 
then the darkness thin , and there be light again , and_then bright sunlight . 
beaten with fear and sound and wet and chill , they crawl to the hurricane_deck and look out haggardly at a world of water that reach clear to the surrounding hills . 
the water_level be high than their hub . 
only the heavy bone of the oxen keep them anchor . 
there was no real sign of the river now , just a roiling , oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy water that reach everywhere . 
clump of brush ride down the ribbon . 
now_and_then , the glistening side of a half swamped object show as it sweep past . 
the girl crawl out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine , hug her shoulder and still tremble . 
her face be pale but set and her dark eye smolder with blame for ben . 
out of compulsion to say something cheery , ben_prime blurt , `` well , we be lucky to be on soft ground when the first floodhead hit . 
at_least , the wheel dig in . 
the soaking will put life back in the wagon , too '' . 
his wife did n't give a sign she 'd hear . 
she was watch a tree ride wildly down that roiling current . 
somebody was ride the tree . 
it race closer and they could see a woman with white hair , sit astride an upright branch . 
she did not call_out . 
but as the tree pass , she lift an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell . 
they watch the tree until it twist sharply on a bend . 
it spear up_into_the_air , then sink back , the up jutting branch turn slowly . 
the pale blob of the woman disappear . 
`` there be the one who 's lucky '' ! the girl murmur harshly . 
ben 's eye strain with the bitter hurt , his homely face slashed with gray and crimson . 
then he take_off his wet boot and drop_down into the water to talk with the beast , need their comfort more than they need his . 
it be nearly sundown and he go to the back of the wagon , half swim his way , for he be not a tall man . 
he let_down the tailgate and was knock_over by the sluice of water . 
he sputtered back to his foot and scramble madly to pull his bag of seed_grain forward . 
they be already swollen to burst . 
of all their worldly_belongings , next_to the oxen and his gun , the seed_grain had be the most treasured . 
it was spoil now for seed , and it would sour and mold in three day if they fail to find a place and fuel to dry it . 
the oxen might as_well enjoy it . 
he examine the watermark on the iron tire when the animal were finish . 
the water lie muddy but placid , without a ripple of movement against the wheel ; there was not a match width of damp mark to show they were recede . 
he doubt if a man could wade as far as the desolate , dry hills that rim the valley . 
a terrible , numbing sense of futility sweep_over him . 
he grip the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat . 
then he notice that the dry wood of the wheel had swell . 
the spoke be tight again , the iron tire grip onto the wheel as if of one piece . 
hope surged within him . 
he swing toward the front to give the news to hettie , then stop , bar from her by the vehemence of her blame and hate . 
still , he feel better . 
a tight wagon mean so much . 
he got a small fire start and put_on bacon and coffee . 
he pour the water off the sourdough and off the flour , salvage the chunky , watery mess for biscuit of a sort . 
their jam and jelly had not suffer . 
he find a jar of preserved tomato and one of eggs that they had mean to save . 
now he break_open them open , hope a good meal might lessen this depression crush hettie . 
his long nose wiggle at the smell of frizzle bacon and heating java , but the fire be low , and he want to waste no time . 
he furl the slashed side of the canvas tarpaulin , leave the rib and wagon open . 
he look thoughtfully at his wife 's trunk , hold her meager treasure . 
he say hesitantly , `` hettie , i do n't figure your things get wet too_much . 
that be a good trunk . 
if you want to get them air '' . 
she say without turn her head , `` after that rain beat in atop the dust , there be n't a thing that won n't be streaked '' . 
he draw a long breath and open the trunk and hang out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon rib . 
person say nothing . 
`` is there any word you would like to offer in your own defense '' ? 
person shake his head . 
person say , `` answer me properly , person '' . 
person be_quiet for a moment long , then he say , `` there be nothing i want to say , captain '' . 
`` very_well '' . 
person walk away . 
naval procedure , he think , have its moment of grim humor . 
person had cold-bloodedly plan the murder of his captain , yet it seem in_order to chide him for a lapse of proper address . 
during the morning hour , it become clear that the arrest of person was have no sobering effect upon the man of the somers . 
those name in the greek paper were manufacture reason to steal aft under pretence of some call of duty , so_as to be near person , watch an opportunity to communicate with him . 
hostile glance were flash at both person and person . 
the two meet in the captain 's cabin . 
`` what be the next step , captain '' ? 
`` more arrest , i fear '' . 
in your opinion , who be this person on the ' certain ' list `` ? 
`` person , of_course . 
he be the old and most experienced of the lot . 
he see the danger , not the glory of being identify as a mutineer . 
somehow he talk_into person into let him use another name '' . 
there be a tap at the door and person enter with the word that person wish to see the captain . 
`` have him come_in '' . 
person , breathless and wild-eyed , bring the chilling news that the handspike , heaver and holystone had been mysteriously remove from their customary place . 
`` and also , sir , two article which were consider souvenir now must be regard in another light entirely . 
an african knife and battle-ax are at this moment be sharpen by person and person . 
person was overhear to say that he would like to get the knife into person 's possession and that '' - 
`` where did you gather all this information , person ? 
who report to you the disappearance of handspike and heaver and who '' - 
he was interrupt by a crash from the deck and spring toward the ladder , with person and person behind him . 
a glance reveal that the main topgallant_mast had been carry_away . 
the aimless mill_about of_what had be a well trained , well organized crew strike person with horror . 
he bellow order and watch the alert response of some of his man and watch , too , the way a dozen or more turn their head questioningly toward the shackled figure as though for further instruction . 
person hasten to person 's side . 
`` person violently jerk the weather royal_brace with full intention to carry_away the mast . 
i see him myself and it was do after consultation with person . 
i swear it , sir '' . 
and it was clear that person be not mistaken , for both person and person take no step toward aid in the sending up of the new topgallant_mast till person had give the signal to obey . 
then , with disappointment evident upon their face , they move to the work . 
person guess that they had plan confusion and turmoil , think it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed . 
their strategy be sound enough and , he reason , had been defeat only by person 's unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originate . 
when the mast was raise , person give the order for person and person to be place under arrest , and now three figure in irons sprawl upon the open deck and terror stalk the somers . 
person 's potential follower be openly sullen and morose , miss muster without excuse , express in ominous tone their displeasure at the prisoner being keep in irons , communicate with the three by glance and signal . 
one of the missing handspike come_out of its hiding_place after person had been insolently disobey by person . 
person had report the man to person and an hour later , with back turn , had been attack by person , brandish the weapon . 
person , shackled and snarl , was throw with the other prisoner and was soon join by person , person and person . 
not a man on the brig , loyal or villainous , could be unaffected by the sight of seven man involve in the crime of mutiny . 
in the tiny cabin , person meet with person , person and person to speak and to listen . 
three day had pass since person 's arrest and each day had bring new danger , new fear . 
person say , `` it require an omniscient eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely_on . 
to have the greek paper be not the great help that at first flush it seem . 
from action aboard , it be easy to guess that person 's boast of twenty staunch follower be a modest estimate '' . 
`` well '' , person venture , `` why do n't we hold an investigation with questioning and '' - 
`` that would be worse than useless '' , person break_in . 
`` there be not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoner . 
besides , suppose we hold a court of inquiry , then what ? 
then we have inform a large_number of our crew that when they reach the united_states , they will be punish but that in the meanwhile , they may run loose and are expect to perform their job in_good_order . 
person , does this sound like a truly workable plan to you ? 
do you not think these man might choose the black_flag here_and_now '' ? 
person say , `` of_course they would . 
they are about to do so at any moment as_it_is . 
all that is need be for one man to feel self-confident enough to take the lead . 
as_soon_as that one man is appoint by himself or the others or by a signal from person , we are going_to be rush . 
we are going_to be rush and murder '' . 
`` that is extravagant language , person . 
we are not going_to be rush and murder '' , person say . 
`` we are going_to bring the somers into new_york harbor safe and sound '' . 
`` of_course , i agree with the captain '' , person say thoughtfully , `` but the conspiracy be ferocious and desperate . 
the instinct of discipline has been lose . 
anything be possible when anarchy have the upper_hand '' . 
he pause , then add , `` everything on a ship be a weapon . 
implement of wood and iron be available for close and hasty combat no_matter where a man stand . 
and we be positive of so few and suspicious of so many '' . 
`` we ourselves must stand_sentinel '' . 
person say . 
`` under_arms day and night , watch and watch about . 
those of us present , the person brother , person and the other midshipman now have the responsibility of the somers . 
a great_deal of labor we have as_well , for we be too uncertain of where trust may be place '' . 
and when he be alone again in the cabin , person lower his head into his arm and weep , for he know full well what must be do , what in_the_end would be do . 
with all his heart he had love the navy and now he must act in accordance with the navy 's implacable law . 
and when he did , when he give to his ship that protection necessary to preserve her honor , he know he would lose forever the navy to which he had dedicate his soul . 
where had he fail ? 
how had he fail ? 
he who had try so hard , who had yearn so passionately to be a great officer . 
it come_to him as he weep there aboard the somers that it be as foolish to strive for greatness as to seek to storm the gate of heaven . 
it was give or it was not give . 
one do one 's best and if fortune smiled , there be a reward . 
one do one 's best and if fortune frowned , an eighteen year old boy with murder in his heart sail aboard one 's ship . 
and person sob like a girl for the dream he had have , and he feel no shame . 
god_knew his tear be his to shed if he so desire , for it had not been with an egotist 's rage for fame that he had hold precious his naval career . 
another field had give him fame enough to satisfy any egotist . 
it was for love that he had serve the navy . 
to have someday that love return be what he had live for . 
now the hope be gone . 
yes , he would bring the somers safely into new_york harbor but at a price . 
dear_god , at what a price . 
and after a while , he dry his tear and walk the deck as a captain should with assurance and dignity . 
stern faced , he inspect the prisoner , satisfy himself that they be clean , well feed and comfortable within_reason . 
the prisoner avert their eye but not before he had glimpse hatred and anger . 
only person , the giant boatswain , be mild-mannered and respectful . 
he say , `` captain , may i speak , please ? 
captain , i be innocent of any plot against you or the ship '' . 
`` be you , person '' ? 
`` yes , sir . 
before god i swear i be innocent . 
i know nothing of any plot , if there be such a thing '' . 
`` you be the only man aboard who can be in doubt '' . 
`` i cannot speak_for others , sir , but i be innocent '' . 
he lean closer to person , squint up at him from the deck . 
`` surely , captain , you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything '' . 
`` no , person , i did not find your name . 
you be careful about that '' . 
now person , seem with effort to shake himself from lethargy , speak . 
he say , `` person is tell you the truth . 
he be innocent '' . 
person shift his gaze to person . 
the calmness and detachment of his tone suggest unawareness of how implicit be his own guilt in the words he had used to defend person . 
person know person too well to think him naive or thick-skulled . 
and in a sudden wave of painful clarity , person recognize a kinship with person . 
here be another human who understand the stupidity of quarrel with the inevitable . 
there be good_fortune and there be bad and person , in handcuffs and ankle irons , know it to be a truth . 
he expect nothing for himself but that which naturally follow those marked for misfortune . 
the red haired captain , tower above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authority , was shock to find himself look with_sympathy upon person . 
this tragic lad had forge his own shackle . 
but he could not have done so , could not have find the way , had fortune favor him . 
and because fortune had favor neither the prisoner nor the red haired captain , they would be each other 's undoing . 
`` person , if there be guilt , if you do not deny your own , how is it possible for person to be innocent ? 
he be your constant companion '' . 
the hazel eye meet person 's . 
`` i tell you he be innocent '' . 
`` and do you think there be a reason why i should accept your word '' ? 
`` yes . 
i have nothing to gain by defend person '' . 
`` nothing to lose , either , person '' . 
`` that 's true '' , person agree and withdraw himself from the conversation . 
his eye go_back to contemplation of the sea . 
`` i be innocent , captain '' , person say again . 
`` before god , captain , i be innocent '' . 
and though it be logical that a man who could plot mass_murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth , still it be difficult to understand why person speak_for only for person . 
the boatswain be as guilty as any . 
no action of his could be interpret in his favor and four midshipman , prior to their know the significance of the greek paper , had see it in person 's hand while person whisper explanation . 
`` i think '' , person had tell person , `` that person was teach him geometry '' . 
it was fantastic to turn from the seven man in shackle to the wardroom , where a class of apprentice await him . 
this be a training_ship and the training would continue , but there be an element of frightful absurdity here which person recognize . 
some of these apprentice be , in physical strength , already man and doubtless a percentage of them be person 's follower . 
`` and i 'll take you with me '' . 
the two of them against the world . 
that had be how she imagine it . 
for when he begin to talk and dream all at_the_same_time , make his plan as he go , she had begin dream too . 
but now the dream be over . 
the big waking_up had happen . 
`` what did i imagine '' ? she think . 
`` did i see him about to swing low in a chariot ? 
or maybe pole up the south fork of the location brave the waste dump in it ? 
maybe i see him on a barge with a gang of ethiopian pole it '' . 
and i 'll take you with me . 
he had take her all_right . 
wednesday night after youth fellowship . 
out of the church and into his big car , it tool over the road with him drive and the headlight sweep the pike ahead and after he hit college , his expansiveness , the quaint little pine board tourist_court , cabin really , with a cute naked light_bulb in the ceiling ( unfrosted and naked as a streetlight , like the one on the corner where you used_to play when you be a kid , where you watch the bat swoop in after the bug , watch in between your bout at hopscotch ) , a room complete with moth ping the light and the few casual cockroach cruise the wall , an insect group with feeler wave . 
and the bed that sag in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many time before and the wall fine and thin for overhear talk in the next room when person go_out for ice , the sound come through the wall like something on the other side of the curtain , so you know they hear you when they be quiet and while you lie wonder what they had hear you listen . 
and person would be in memphis today for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody know he would , just like everybody know all_along . 
like person and the mayor up there grip the microphone and person back in his office yank out tooth , like they all know he would . 
just like the balloon would go_up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a leak or blow_up to_hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen . 
or you could hope the parachute would n't open just so you could say you see it not open , not because you mean any harm to person in his suit of red underwear , but mainly because you be tired_of be an old_maid - a thing which cannot admit when it think it might be pregnant , but must stand the dizzy feeling all alone and go_on like everything be all_right instead of be able to say to somebody in a normal voice : `` i think i be pregnant '' . 
you could wish that . 
or you could wish your daddy would really do it - kill person like he say when you all_the_time , all_along , could feel the nerve drain out of him like air out of a punctured tire when you be on a muddy road alone and it is rain and at night . 
so you sit in the car and listen to the air run_out and listen to the rain and see the mud in_front_of the headlight , wait for you , for your new spectator_pump , wait for you to squat by yourself out there in your tight skirt , cry and afraid and try to get that damned son_of_a_bitch tire off , because that be be an old_maid too , if you happen to drive a car , it be change the tire yourself in the night , and in the mud and the rain , hate to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help . 
and every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who think after he has rape you he have to beat your brain out with a tire_tool so you won n't tell , a combination like ham_and_eggs , rape her and kill her , and that be be an old_maid too . 
it be not have his baby nestle warm and fat against your breast and it be not have somebody that really gives_a_damn whether some tramp crack your skull . 
and most of all it be not have the only man you could love , whether he drive a bread truck or deliver the mail or check the berry crate down at the shed , or own seventeen oil_well and six diamond mine , for if you be anybody what he be or do make no difference if he be the one . 
he can even be a mild voiced little town guy with big town idea and level gray eye and a heart even person could n't figure_out , how it is unlock . 
and he can be on_the_way to memphis , your person can , and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and love him and want him even if it mean you want him - really want him - dead . 
because if you can n't then nobody else can either , nobody else can have him . 
for you do n't share him , not even with god . 
if it is love , you do n't . 
and i 'll take you with me . 
even if that be all the promise he ever give or ever will give , the giving of it once be enough and you believe it then and you will always believe it , even when it be finally the only thing in the world you have left to believe , and the whole world is tell you that one be a lie . 
even when he be on_the_way to memphis you will still have the promise rest inside you like a gift , and it be he inside of you . 
and in_a_way the promise work_out true , for whether he want you or not , you go with him in your heart . 
you feel him every mile far away . 
you feel where he be and what he see , and at night you feel when he be asleep or with the other woman , the one that never could love him the way you do , the one who get him because she did n't particularly give_a_damn whether she get him or did n't . 
and you know you will always wonder all_of your life whether it was because you want him so bad that you did n't get him , and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think_of that other guy , the chump who beg you to marry him , the one with the plastered hair and the car he can n't afford and the too shiny shoe . 
you think : `` did he feel that way about me '' ? 
it come_to you that probably he did feel that way to let you use him like you did when you could n't have person ; that he must have since he be there like the radio for you to turn_on or snap off when you get tired_of him , that other guy . 
it dawn on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table from you , he be a man , and that because person was make you miserable , you were pass it down to him , to person 's substitute , that other guy . 
and you wonder if that be why the little man lose his job and his car and stay drunk about a year before he straighten_out and move to st._louis , where he got to be a big unhappy success . 
you wonder if he look at his wife now and think_of you . 
you wonder about the christmas_card with no name on it , and it come_to you that maybe it would have be better to have make somebody else happy if you could n't be happy yourself , to give somebody else the one they want - to give them you . 
`` damn the world '' , she think . 
she look out at the corn field , the great green deep acre of it rolled_out like the sea in the field beyond the whitewashed fence border the grounds . 
the mayor envision factory there . 
home and factory and school and a big wide federal highway , instead of peaceful corn to rest your eye on while you try to rest your heart , while you try not to look at the balloon and the bandstand and the uniform and the flash of the instrument . 
the band be impatient , but they be the only ones . 
the others , the ones in the stands , be spellbound , for hear the mayor be for them like listen to a symphony be for sophisticated folk in new_york_city . 
it be like be in the concert_hall in the afternoon and hear the piano virtuoso rehearse . 
he be good and they know that what he was do for them he would do all_over the united_states someday . 
so they stay quiet and hang not on what he say but on how he say it , not listen exactly , but rather , feel . 
if a man be good , if he was going_to be governor , you feel it and you want him to go_on forever . 
you be sorry when he finish talk because while he be up there you be someone else and the world be something else too . 
it be a place full of courage and hope and you be part of it . 
you laugh and then your chest swell and you feel you could cry for a little bit , and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and the goose_bumps ripple along your arm . 
he hit the theme about die to defend your country , and you be ready to do it right then , without a second_thought . 
while he talk you would n't trade be a location farmer for be anything else in the whole damned world , no_matter if it had n't , in six week , rain enough to wet_a_rat 's_ass . 
she glance at the man nod beside her , a man with weather crack furrow into his lean cheek , with powdery pale eye reflect all the drought he had see , reflect the sky and the drought which must follow now in august - yes , with eye predict the drought and here it was only june , only festival time again and thought of person would not leave her . 
`` i should have stay at the store '' , she think . 
back at the group with the other old_maid , back there she be the young clerk and she be thirty-four , which make her young enough to resent the usual ideal working condition , like the unventilated toilet with the door you have to hold shut while you sit_down . 
there was no lock because person did n't allow a lock . 
a lock on the toilet would encourage malingering and primping . 
the toilet had n't have a sincere scrubbing in years and there were thing written on the wall of the little boxed_in place because you could n't keep the public out - entirely . 
she could not count the time person had rap on the door , just a_couple_of bang that shake the whole damned closet and might , someday , break_away the pipe connection from the wall . 
the two little bang mean that he was get impatient to have a crowd of customer wait on and that if he have to he would jerk open the door and drag out , by the opposite doorhandle which she would be clutch , whichever-the-hell clerk it be who think she could waste so_much store time on the pot . 
and the hours be six-thirty in the morning until eleven at night on saturday and during sale , and there were no chair and you could n't smoke and the cooling was overhead fan and there was no porter or janitor . 
among us , we three handle quite a few small commission , from spot drawing for advertising_agency uptown to magazine work and quick lettering job . 
each of us have his own specialty besides . 
person do wonderful complicated pen-and-ink drawing like something out of a medieval miniature : hundred of delicate detail cram into an eight by ten sheet and look as if they had be done under a jeweler's_glass . 
he also draw precise crisp spot , which he sell to various literary and artistic journal , the new_yorker , for_instance , or esquire . 
i do book_jacket and cover for paperback reprint : naked girl huddle in corner of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway , dare the cop to take him , be the guy in shirtsleeves clutch a revolver . 
the book could be the_brothers_karamazov , but it would still have the same jacket illustration . 
i remember once i do a jacket for group ; the book be a fine historical novel about person , , and i do a week of research to get the detail just_right : the fifteenth century armor , furnishings , clothes . 
i even ferret_out the material from which shield were make - linden wood cover with leather - so i 'd get the light reflection accurate . 
person , the art_editor , take_a_look one look at my finished sketch and say , `` nothing_doing , person . 
in the first place , it be static ; in the second place , it does n't look authentic ; and in the third place , it would cost a fortune to reproduce in_the_first_place - you 've get six color there include gold '' . 
i say , `` person , it be as authentic as careful research can make it '' . 
he say , `` that may be , but it be n't authentic the way reader think . 
they know from their research into television and the movie that knight in the middle_ages have beautiful flowing haircut like person , and only the villain have beard . 
and girl could n't have dress like that - it be n't transparent enough '' . 
in_the_end , i do the same old picture , the naked girl and the guy in the doorway , only i put a person shirt on the guy , give him a sword instead of a pistol , and paint in furniture from the still of a costume movie . 
person be as happy_as_a_clam . 
`` that be authenticity '' , he say . 
as for person , he actually sell painting . 
we all paint in our spare_time , and we had all start as easel painter with scholarship , but he be the only one of us who make any regular money at it . 
not much ; he sell perhaps three or four a year , and usually all to person or her friend . 
he have style , a real inner vision of his very own . 
it be strange stuff - it remind me of the picture of a child , but a child who has never play with other kid and has live all its life with adult . 
there was the freshness of color , the freedom of perception , the lack of self-consciousness , but with a twist that make the form leap from the page and smack you in the eye . 
we used to kid him by say he only paint that way because he be so nearsighted . 
it may have be true for all i know , because his glasses be like the bottom of milk bottle , but it did n't prevent the painting from be exciting . 
he also have , at_times , an uncanny absentminded air like a sleepwalker ; he would look right through you while you were talk to him , and if you say , `` for_christ's_sake , person , you 've get prussian_blue all_over your shirt '' , he would smile , and nod , and an hour later the paint would be all_over his pants as_well . 
person think_of him as her discovery , and she pay two to three hundred dollar for a painting . 
it be all gravy , and person did n't need much to live_on ; none of us did . 
we share the expense of the studio , and we all live within walking distance of it , in cheap lodgings of one kind or another . 
attend the life_class be my idea - or rather , person 's idea , but i be ripe for it , and the other two would n't have go if i had n't talk_into them into it . 
i want to paint again . 
i had n't do a serious picture in almost a year . 
it be n't just the pressure of work , although that be the excuse i often use , even to myself . 
it be the kind of work i was do , the quality of the ambition it awake in me , that keep_from me from painting . 
i kept say , `` if i could just build_up a reputation for myself , make some real money , get_to be well_known as an illustrator - like person , for_instance - then i could take_time_off some time_off and paint '' . 
person be a kind of goal i set myself ; i had admire him long before i talk to him . 
it look to me as though he have everything an artist could want , joy in his work , standing in the profession , a large and steady income . 
the night we first meet , at one of person 's giant party , he was wear a brown cashmere jacket with silver button and a soft pink viyella shirt ; instead of a necktie he wear a leather bolo draw through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure jade . 
this set his tone : richness of texture and color , and another kind of richness as_well , for his clothing and decoration would have pay the brush-off 's rent for a year . 
he be fifteen year older than i - forty four - but full of spring and sparkle . 
he did n't look_like what i think_of as an old_man , and his lively and erudite speech make him seem even young . 
he be one of the most prominent magazine illustrator in america ; you see one of his painting on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazine every_month . 
group had include him in its `` modern american artist '' series and had photograph him at his studio in the east_sixties ; the corner of it you could see in the photograph look as though it ought to have person in it paint the royalty of spain . 
i have a long talk with him . 
we go_into person 's library , which have low bookshelf all along the wall , and above them a person portrait , a person twelve foot long , and a gorgeous person with a yellow background , that look_like an inscription from a martian tomb . 
the fireplace have tile make for person by picasso himself . 
like certain expensive restaurant , just sit there give you the illusion of be wealthy yourself . 
in the course of our talk , person mention that he spend part of each_week study . 
`` by yourself '' ? 
i ask . 
`` no , i take class with different people '' , he say . 
`` i do n't think i 've reach the point , yet , where i can say i know everything i ought to know about the craft . 
besides , it be important to the way a painter think that he should move in a certain atmosphere , an atmosphere in which he may absorb the idea of other master , as person go_to italy to meet person and person '' . 
he make a circle with his thumb and finger . 
`` painting be n't this big , you know . 
it does n't embrace only the artist , alone before his easel . 
it be as large as all_of art , interdependent , varied , multitudinous '' . 
he throw his arm wide , his face shining . 
`` the artist be like a fragment of a mosaic - no , he be more_than that , a virtuoso performer in some vast philharmonic . 
one_of_these_days , i 'm going to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that 's being paint these day , from extreme abstract_expressionism to extreme photorealism , and_then you 'll be able to see at a glance how much artist have in_common with each other . 
the eye be all , inward or outward . 
ah , what a title for the exhibition : the eye be all '' ! 
`` what do you study '' ? 
i ask . 
i was fascinate ; just listen to him made me feel intelligent . 
`` i 'm study anatomy with person '' , he reply . 
`` maybe you know him . 
he teach at the group '' . 
i nod . 
i had study with person ten year before , during the scholarship year the location give me , along with the five_hundred dollar prize for my painting of bum on location . 
person and i had not love each other . 
`` i 'm also study enamel with person '' , he go_on , `` and twice a week i go_to a life_class teach by person '' . 
`` person '' ? 
i say . 
`` my god , be he still alive ? 
he must be a_million years old . 
i go_to a retrospective of his work when i be eighteen , and i think he be a contemporary of person 's '' . 
`` not quite '' . 
person laugh . 
`` he be about sixty , now . 
still paint , still a kind of modern impressionist , beautiful canvas of mountain and farm . 
he even make the city look_like one of thoreau 's hangout . 
i 've always admire him , and when i hear he was take a_few pupil , i go to him and join his class '' . 
`` yes , it sound great '' , i say , `` but suppose you do n't think_of yourself as an impressionist painter '' ? 
`` you 're miss the point '' , he say . 
`` he have the magical eye . 
and he be a great man . 
contact with him be stimulating . 
and that be the trouble with so many artist today . 
they lack stimulation . 
they sit alone in their room and try to paint , and only succeed in isolate themselves still farther from life . 
that be one of the reason art is become a useless occupation . 
in the middle_ages , in the renaissance , right up_to the early nineteenth century , the painter be a giant in the world . 
he be an artisan , a man who study his trade and develop his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a woodcarver do . 
he fill a real need , show society what it look_like , turn it inside_out , portray its war and its leaders , its ugliness and its beauty , reflect its profound religious impulse . 
he be a propagandist - they be n't afraid of the word , then - satirist , nature lover , philosopher , scientist , what you will , a member of every party and of no party . 
but look_at us today ! 
we hold safe little job illustrate toothpaste ad or the salacious incident in trivial novel , and most_of our easel painting be nothing but pick the fluff out of the navel so it can be contemplate in greater purity . 
a bunch of amateur dervish ! 
what we need is to get_back to the group , to learning and apprenticeship , to the cafe and the school '' . 
he could certainly talk . 
the upshot of the evening be that i get the address of person 's studio - or rather , of the studio in which he give his class , for he did n't work there himself - and join the life_class , which meet every tuesday and thursday from ten to twelve in the morning . 
it be an awkward hour , but i did n't have to punch_in any time_clock , and it only mean that sometimes i had to stay a_couple_of hour later at the drawing_board to finish_up a job . 
after a short time , both person and person join the class with me so they would n't feel lonely , and we used_to hang a sign on the door of the brush-off read `` out to work '' . 
it be mostly for the benefit of the mailman , because hardly anybody else ever visit us . 
in_a_way , person be right . 
`` stimulate '' be the word for it . 
i do n't know that it be always as rewarding as i had expect it to be . 
partly , it was because person himself be n't what i anticipate . 
i had come prepare to worship at the foot of this classic , and he turn_out to be a rather bitter old_man who smell of dead cigar . 
no , that be n't quite fair . 
actually , there be a_lot of force in him , which be why i keep_on in that class instead of quit after a week . 
`` i have a rather small place of my own . 
a nice bachelor apartment in a place called the location '' . 
`` uhhu '' , she say , hardly listen as she study her left eyelid . 
`` and_then i have another place far downtown i use as a studio '' . 
`` uhhu '' . 
`` i 'm not a man who have many close intimate friend , person '' , he say , want her to know all about him . 
`` oh , i 'd drink with newspaper people . 
i think i be what you might call a convivial man , and yet it be when i be alone in my studio , do my work , that i really feel alive . 
but i think a man need at_least one intimate friend to communicate with '' . 
pause , he wait for her to turn , to ask a question . 
she show no interest at_all in the life he had lead back home , and it hurt him a_little . 
`` well , what about you , person '' ? 
`` me '' ? she ask , turn slowly . 
`` what about me '' ? 
`` did you make friend easily '' ? 
`` umm , uhhu '' . 
`` somehow i imagine that as you grow_up you be alone a_lot . 
how about it '' ? 
`` i guess so '' , she say take a kleenex from her purse . 
when she had wipe some of the lipstick from her mouth , she stare solemnly at her image in the mirror . 
`` are your people still alive '' ? he ask , try to touch a part of her life person had n't discuss ; so he could have something of her for himself . 
`` you talk so well , person '' , he go_on . 
`` you seem to have read so much , you have a natural gift for words '' , he add , try to flatter her vanity . 
`` you must have be good at history at school . 
where did you go_to school '' ? 
`` what be this '' ? she ask , turn suddenly . 
`` do n't you know all about me by this time ? 
my name 's person . 
this be my town . 
i sleep_with you . 
you know something more about me every_day , do n't you ? 
would you be happy if i make_up some story about my life , tell you some lie ? 
why are you try to worry me '' ? 
`` i 'm not try to worry you '' . 
`` well , all_right then '' . 
the cleansing tissue she had been use had been fall on the floor , and he get_up and pick_up one , then another , hope she would notice what he was do . 
at home he had be a clean orderly man , and now he had_to hide his annoyance . 
was she just naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance ? 
he wonder . 
would he have_to clean_up after her every_day , clean the kitchen , the bathroom , and get_down on his knee and scrub the kitchen floor , then hang_up her dress , pick_up her stocking , make the bed while she lie_around ? 
he straighten_up , ready to vent his exasperation , then grow afraid . 
if he dwell on the indignity he suffer he would lose all respect for her , and without the respect he might lose his view of her , too . 
`` what 's the_matter '' ? she ask suddenly . 
`` nothing . 
nothing at_all '' , he say quietly . 
`` let 's go_out '' . 
`` are those the only shoe you have , person '' ? 
`` what 's the_matter with them '' ? 
`` the heavy thick sole . 
look at them '' . 
`` they 're an expensive english shoe for walk_around a_lot . 
i like them '' . 
`` person , no one around here wear such heavy sole . 
ca n't you get another pair '' ? 
`` maybe i could '' , he say , surprise that she could turn from herself and notice anything about him . 
`` i 'll get an elegant pair of thin soled italian shoe tomorrow , person '' . 
`` and i do n't know why you want to go_on wear that outfit '' , she say , make a face . 
`` what 's the_matter with it '' ? 
he had put_on the gray jacket and the dark gray slacks and the fawn colored shirt he had wear that first night in rome when he had encounter her on the street . 
`` oh , person . 
you look_like a tweedy englishman . 
ca n't you wear something else and look a_little more as though you belong '' ? 
`` i do n't mind at_all '' , he say , delight with her attention . 
change his clothes , he put_on his dark-blue flannel suit , and lay away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be put it aside for_good . 
but it be a hopeful sign , he tell himself . 
she no_longer want anything about him to remind her of the circumstance of their meeting that first night in location . 
that day they loaf around , just get the feel of the city . 
they look at the ruin of the old roman wall on the low location , then they go_to the location . 
she had some amusing scandal about the person in the old day . 
then they take a taxi to location . 
`` there 's a church you should see '' , she say . 
and when they stand by the fountain in the piazza look at santa_maria he had_to keep a straight_face , not let_on he had be there with person . 
he let her tell him all about the church . 
then they have dinner . 
all evening she be eloquent and pleased with herself . 
when they get home at midnight she was tire_out . 
and in the morning when he wake_up at ten the church_bell were ring . 
he had never hear so many bell , and as he lie there listen , he think_of her scold him for his remark when he had look up at the obelisk and the church at the top of the location . 
it be a good thing that she cling to her religion , he think . 
she might like to take him to st._peter 's . 
`` person , wake_up '' , he say shake her . 
`` it be ten o'clock . 
are n't you go_out to mass ? 
you could take me to st._peter 's '' . 
`` uhhu '' , she mutter . 
`` come_on , you 'll be late '' . 
`` i think i 'll sleep_in this morning '' , she say drowsily , and as she snuggle against him , he wonder if she ever go_to church . 
why did he want her to go_to church ? 
he wonder . 
probably because it be a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security . 
it would be good for her . 
it be too_bad he have no feeling himself for church . 
not his poor mother 's fault . 
she would have be better_off if she had stick_to her bible . 
as for himself , he just did n't have the temperament for it . 
from the time he had be at college he had achieve a certain tranquility and composure by accept the fact that there be certain thing he could never know . 
then he think_of those old_testament figure on the ceiling of the sistine_chapel . 
just figure out of a tribal folklore . 
could he honestly believe it would be good for person to have those old prophet grip her imagination now ? 
be a woman though , she would take only what she need from church . 
it be too_bad he be n't a catholic himself . 
or a protestant , or one of those amusing dogmatic atheist , or a strict orthodox communist . 
what be the_matter with him that they all weary him ? 
it be the times , he be sure . 
all the ideology change from day to day , right under his eye , so how could a man look_to any one of them for an enlargement of his freedom ? 
it be all_too wearying . 
look somewhere else . 
but where ? 
just_the_same , he think , ponder over it , it would be a good thing for a girl like person if she get_up and go_to church . 
a half-hour later he get_up her up to go_out for breakfast so the person , hear them hurry down the stairs , would think they were go_to a late mass . 
it seem to him that if the person feel sure of them , could place them , it would help him to feel more sure of himself with person . 
`` since we 're have coffee with them this afternoon '' , he say , `` i think i 'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every_day to clean for us '' . 
and he wait for her to say , `` oh , no , i can do it , person . 
there 's so little to do '' . 
`` why not '' ? she say . 
`` i be not good at that kind of thing '' . 
`` this afternoon let 's take an air with them . 
let 's be fine superior people of great dignity '' , he say as if he were joke . 
`` if you find it necessary , person , go_ahead '' , she say , turn on the stair . 
`` i be what i be . 
i can n't help it '' . 
her words remain with him , worry him for hours . 
he did n't know how she would behave with other people . 
when they walk into the person apartment , the old lady , bow and smile , say softly . 
`` ciao , '' and put_out her hand . 
her little brown face wrinkle up , her brown eye gleam , and with her little gesture she say all the courteous thing . 
person , smile too , say , `` ' ello '' , and_then more slowly , `` i be happy '' . 
and they sit_down and begin their little coffee party . 
the person offer them biscuit with the coffee . 
act only as interpreter person , her hand fold on her lap , be utterly impersonal . 
she would turn to them , then turn to him , then turn again . 
watch her , he feel like a spectator at a tennis game , with the ball being bounce back_and_forth . 
person , bob her head encouragingly , ask person about canada , have a special interest . 
person translate . 
the old_woman have a nephew from location , a poor boy from a lumber mill who had get tired_of the seasonal unemployment , and who had migrate to canada to work_on the railway . 
for a year the boy had live in the bush in a boxcar . 
did many_of person 's countryman live in boxcar in the bush ? 
had person ever live in a boxcar ? 
she want to know . 
regretfully person explain that he have no experience with boxcar . 
just_the_same , the old_woman say , she would write to her nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had meet a nice man from his adopted country . 
and person thank her , and hope he might meet her nephew back home , and ask her if she have any further news of the pope . 
a very great pope , this one , the old_woman explain , her black eye sparkling . 
an intellectual . 
but very mystical too . 
it was say that he had have a vision . 
just_as thousand that day in portugal had see the sun dancing in the sky , he had see the same thing later in his own garden , and she turn_to person for confirmation . 
person had been sit quietly , listen with the serenity of the unaware . 
now a little flush come_on her pale homely face and enchantment in her eye . 
the holy_father would die soon , she say to person , so she could translate for person , although he have a brilliant doctor , a man who did not need the assistance of those doctor offer by the great ruler of the world . 
yes , the pope could die and quickly be make a saint . 
no , he be indeed a saint now . 
nod approvingly and swell with importance , the old lady whisper confidentially . 
there be a certain discontent among the cardinal . 
the pope , in the splendor of his great intellect , had neglect them a_little . 
there would be change make , and person should understand that when the pope die it be like the end of a regime in rome . 
job would be lose and new face would become prominent . 
did person understand ? 
indeed he did , person say solemnly , try to get person 's eye . 
surely she could see that these woman be her italian , too , he think . 
devout , orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in brooklyn or location or location . 
but person ; eye be on person whose glowing face and softening eye give her a look of warmth and happiness . 
and person , watch in wonder , turn_to person . 
`` it mean so much to her . 
it 's like a flame , i guess '' , she say in a dreamy tone . 
there be a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun be hot . 
the new location pitcher turn_out to have an overhand fastball that took a hop . 
for a_few inning the location team could n't figure_out him out . 
then , in the fifth , location 's kid catcher catch onto a curve and smack the ball into left centerfield . 
person , location 's redheaded playing manager , run after the ball but it roll past him . 
person cut over to center from leftfield to get the relay . 
person catch_up_with the ball near the fence and throw it to person . 
`` third ! 
third_base '' ! 
person shout . 
person spin_around and make an accurate throw into person 's hand on third_base . 
person catch the ball just as the catcher slide into the bag . 
but the location boy had begin his slide too late . 
he come into the bag with his body and person bring the ball down full in his face . 
`` you bastard '' ! the person catcher scream . 
he jumped_to_his_feet and start to throw punch . 
person toss_away his glove away and begin to swing at the catcher . 
this bring in everybody from both side , while the spectator stand_up and add to the uproar . 
the fighter were separate in a_few minute . 
the game was resume . 
but person be boiling mad now . 
when the inning be over he curse the location catcher all_the_way into the dugout . 
person , come_in from leftfield , stop at the water_fountain for a drink . 
person was stand beside it , face the field . 
he was eye the person catcher warm_up his pitcher before the inning begin . 
`` keep your eye open , sonny '' ! 
person yell to the catcher . 
`` you 're in_for trouble '' . 
the location catcher did not reply with words . 
he simply turn_to person and smile . 
this so infuriate person that he spin_around and say : `` i 'll get that little bastard . 
so_help_me_god , i 'll get him '' . 
person say : `` why do n't you leave him alone '' ? 
`` mind your own goddamn business '' , person say . 
person shrug . 
he step into the dugout , wonder why person was always look_for trouble . 
maybe the answer be in his eye . 
when person smile his eye never fit_in with his lip . 
in the last of the sixth inning person get_up to bat and hit a fastball over the left_fielder 's head . 
by the time the fielder get his hand on the ball person was round third_base and head for home . 
the left_fielder throw and it be a good one . 
but person have no chance of being tag . 
the location catcher was straddle home_plate . 
all person had_to do be slide , fall_away , but instead , he ram into the catcher . 
both fall heavily to the ground . 
only person get to his feet . 
he go_back to touch home_plate , turn and walk to the dugout without look_back . 
the location player and their manager run out on the field . 
they pour water over their catcher 's face . 
he did not move . 
then the manager call_for a doctor . 
the location physician come down to look over the injured ballplayer . 
then , quickly , and a_little nervously , the doctor order a_couple_of ballplayer to carry the catcher into the dressing_room . 
person was sit on the bench , watch . 
when the ballplayer start to carry the catcher off the field he say : `` that ought to teach the sonofabitch '' . 
person , seat next to person , get_up and move to the other end of the bench . 
the location manager was come over to the location dugout . 
he was follow by four of his men . 
it begin to look as if something was going_to happen . 
person sit quietly watch the manager come nearer . 
person move over to person 's side . 
no one say a word . 
the location manager come right up to the dugout in_front of person . 
his face be flushed . 
`` person '' , the manager say , his voice pitched low , quiver . 
`` that be a rotten thing to do '' . 
`` for god 's sake '' , person say , wave the manager away . 
`` stop it , will you ? 
tell your guy not to block the plate '' . 
`` you did n't have_to ram him '' . 
`` that 's what you say '' . 
the location manager look at person . 
it be a cold and calculated look . 
he turn and go_back across the field to his dugout . 
he call_in the pitcher who had been pitch , and a big , heavy , powerfully built right hander move out to the mound for location . 
the game start again and in the eighth inning person come up to bat . 
everyone in the ballpark seem to be stand and shout . 
the first ball the hefty pitcher throw come in for person 's head . 
person fall into the dirt , the ball go over him . 
he arise slowly and brush himself off . 
he get back into the batter's_box and on the next pitch drop into the dirt again . 
`` hit the bum '' ! somebody yell from the location bench . 
in the location dugout person , shortstop , whisper into person 's ear : `` there 's gonna be a fight '' . 
`` look at those bastard '' ! 
person , a pitcher , say . 
`` they 're look_for trouble '' . 
person be slow get into the batter's_box this time . 
when he finally did he had_to duck his head quickly away as the pitch come_in . 
`` listen '' ! he shout to the pitcher . 
`` one more and i 'm come out there '' ! 
`` i 'll be wait '' ! the pitcher yell back . 
person pound the rubber plate with the end of his bat . 
he stand flat-footed in the batter's_box , but not very close to the plate now . 
the pitcher wind_up and the ball come in straight for person 's head . 
person drop , get_up , turn and , hold the bat with both hand up against his chest , begin to walk slowly out to the mound . 
the pitcher toss_away his glove away and come towards person . 
they were both walk towards each other , unhurried . 
location and location player rush_out on the field . 
in the next moment , it seem , the infield be crowded with spectator , ballplayer , cop , kid and a dog . 
there be much shouting and screaming . 
fight spring_up and were quickly squelch . 
person and the location pitcher were pull_away before they even come together . 
person and two other location player did not go out on the field when the fighting start . 
after the game , person was take_off his sweatshirt in the dressing_room when person come_in . 
`` it 's a helluva thing '' , person say , look at person , `` when a guy 's own teammate won n't come_out and help him in a fight '' . 
person sigh and pull the wet sweatshirt over his head . 
person sit_down on the bench near person . 
the other player were undress quietly . 
person had not come_in yet . 
person go over to person and stand over him . 
`` why the hell did n't you come_out when you see them gang_up on me '' ? 
`` i did n't think it be necessary '' . 
`` well ! 
now that 's just fine ! 
you did n't think it be necessary '' . 
person place both his hand on his hip . 
he push his jaw forward . 
`` listen , wise_guy , if you think i 'm gonna do all the fighting for this ball_club you 're crazy '' . 
person have a good two inch over person and person had_to look up into person 's face . 
`` i did n't ask you to fight for the ball_club '' , person say slowly . 
`` nobody else did , either '' . 
`` you try to say i start the fight '' ? 
`` i 'm not try to say anything '' . 
person turn_away and open his locker , and_then he hear person say : `` you 're yellow , person '' ! 
and person bang his locker door shut and spin_around . 
but before anything could happen person be between them and person had come into the dressing_room . 
`` person , come into my office '' , person say . 
person follow person into the office and shut the door . 
he sit_down before person 's desk . 
`` i 'm do you a favor '' , person say quickly . 
`` you get your unconditional release as of today '' . 
person 's eye widen just a_trifle . 
`` the best thing for you to do '' , person say , `` be go_home . 
you do n't belong in professional baseball '' . 
person had_to clear his throat . 
`` be this because of what happen out there '' ? 
`` no '' , person say . 
`` but it does confirm what i 've suspect all_along '' . 
person stand_up . 
`` listen ! 
this be the second time '' . 
`` sit_down , sit_down '' , person say . 
`` i 'm not say you 're yellow . 
i am say you 're not a professional ballplayer '' . 
person lean forward over the desk . 
`` now listen to me , person . 
i 'm not steer you wrong . 
you have_got n't got the heart for baseball '' . 
person shake his head and person frown . 
suddenly his voice grow hard . 
`` what the hell do you think baseball be ? 
you 're not in the big_league , but if you can n't give_and_take down here what the hell do you think it 'll be like up there '' ? 
person start to say something but person cut_short him short . 
`` now do n't tell me what a good ballplayer you be . 
i know you 've have_got talent . 
but what you have_got n't got be the heart to back_up that talent with . 
the heart , person . 
you just have_got n't got the heart for pro-ball , and that 's it '' . 
dazed , person say : `` i do n't get_it . 
my batting_average & & & '' . 
person stand_up abruptly , then sit_down just as abruptly . 
`` what difference does your batting_average make ? 
or your fielding_average . 
or even the way you run_bases . 
i tell you when it 's necessary to hurt in_order to win - you won n't do it . 
that 's what i mean by no heart for the game . 
baseball 's no cinch . 
person had no business ram into that kid out there . 
he do it because he know for each guy he put out_of_commission that 's one less who might take_away his job away later_on . 
what the hell do you think baseball be ? 
a sport ? 
it 's a way_of_life , goddamit ! 
and you 've got to be ready to cut_to_ribbons anybody who want to take_away your way_of_life away from you '' ! 
he 's wrong ! 
person think . 
it 's only his opinion . 
there be other club in this league . 
he stand_up slowly . 
he be a_little pale and shaky . 
his lip feel glued together . 
`` i think you 're wrong , person '' , he say finally . 
person nod . 
`` okay . 
you 'll get your pay in the morning '' . 
person turn and leave the room , hear person say : 
`` someday you 'll see i be right '' . 
person shut the door behind him . 
outside in the dressing_room , person sit on the bench dressed in his street_clothes . 
`` what happen '' ? 
person ask . 
person say : `` i get my release '' . 
`` you crazy '' ? 
person shrug . 
`` what for '' ? 
person sigh . 
person shake his head . 
`` i do n't get_it '' . 
`` i do n't know '' , person say . 
they be silent for a_few moment . 
then person say : `` what are you gonna do '' ? 
person start to take_off his clothes off and person sit_down on the bench again . 
person take_off one shoe and stare at it . 
`` do n't take it like this '' , person say . 
`` hell , plenty of guy get let_out and come_back later . 
the league be full of guy like that '' . 
person be very quiet . 
`` what are you gonna do , person '' ? 
person did not answer . 
`` why not try another club '' ? 
person look up . 
what the hell right did person have say a thing like that ? 
`` springfield 's in tomorrow '' , person say . 
`` talk to person '' . 
he just did n't know what he was talk_about , say a thing like that . 
`` will you do it , person '' ? 
`` do what '' ? 
`` ask person for a job '' . 
person nod . 
`` sure '' , he say . 
`` springfield come_in tomorrow '' ? 
person nod . 
`` i 'll speak_to person '' . 
`` atta_boy '' . 
`` i 'll talk to him , all_right '' . 
`` do n't worry '' , person say . 
`` you 'll get a job there . 
he need outfielder bad '' . 
`` i 'm not worry about it '' , person say . 
`` that 's the way to talk . 
what else did person have to say '' ? 
`` nothing '' , person say . 
up-to-date , however , his garden be still more_or_less of a mess , he had n't even start his workshop and if there was a meadow pond in the neighborhood he had n't find it . 
it was n't his fault that these thing be so . 
the difficulty be that each day seem to produce its quota of detail which must be clean_up immediately . 
as a result , life had become a kind of continuous makeready . 
once he dispose_of these item which screamed so harshly for attention , he could undertake the thing which really count . 
then , at_last , his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to read , or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon , accompanied by his dog . 
his dog ? 
he had almost forget them , although they had play such an important part in his early dream . 
then they had always been romp around him on these walk , yelp with delight , dash off into the bush on fruitless hunting_expedition , return to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paw . 
dog do something to one 's ego . 
they were constantly assure you that you be one of the world 's great guy . 
regardless_of how much of a slob you know yourself to be , you could be certain they would never find_out - and even if they did it would make no difference . 
now it become increasingly apparent that there were to be no dog in the picture . 
what in the world were you going to do with a_lot_of dog when you leave for town on monday afternoon ? 
you certainly could n't take them into the little apartment and if you try to farm_out them out for two or three day every_week they would become so confused that they would have nervous_breakdown . 
why in the world could n't he live in one place the way everyone else seem to ? 
it worry him , this inability to get the simple thing done in the course of a day . 
he would wake_up in_the_middle of the night and fret about it . 
how in the world had he formerly find time to build_up a business , raise a family , be on half_a_dozen board , work actively on committee and either go_out in the evening or plow through the content of a bulging briefcase ? 
was it possible that as people grow older the nature of time change ? 
could it be that it speed_up for the aged in some mysterious way , as if a bored universe were skip through the end of the chapter just to get_it_over_with ? 
or be the answer less metaphysical ? 
did old people work more slowly ? 
did it take a man of sixty-five longer to write a letter , shave , clean_out a barn , read a newspaper , than a man of thirty ? 
did man become perfectionist as they grow older , polish , polish , reluctant to let_go ? 
it might be that certain people be_born with a compulsion to complicate their life , while others could live blissfully motionless almost indefinitely , like lizard in the sun , too indolent to blink their eye . 
perhaps it was his misfortune , or good_fortune , whichever way one look_at it , to belong_to the former group , and he was struggle unconsciously to build_up pressure in a world which demand none , which be positively antagonistic to_it . 
and then_again perhaps the reason why he could n't find time to do any of the thing he had plan to do after retirement : read , roam , garden , lie on his back and watch the cloud go_by , be because he did n't want to do them . 
there was no compulsion behind them . 
they could be done or leave undone and nobody really gave_a_damn . 
during all his busy life he had only do thing which had to be do . 
this habit had become so fixed over the year that it seem futile to do anything for which no_one was wait . 
he look at the luminous dial of his wrist_watch . 
it was five minute after four . 
on some distant farm a rooster crow and , far down the valley , an associate answer . 
he turn_over impatiently and pull the sheet over his head against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn . 
at_least he could buy the equipment for his workshop . 
thus committed , action might follow . 
he go down to group 's hardware_store and buy a full set of carpenter 's tool , include a rotary power_saw and several other piece of power machinery that person say be essential for babbiting and doweling , whatever they be . 
he also buy a huge square of pegboard for hang_up his tool , and lumber for his workbench , sandpaper and glue and assorted nail , level and t-square and plumb_line and several gadget that he have no idea how to use or what they be for . 
`` there '' , say person . 
`` that 'll get you started . 
best not to get everything at_once . 
add thing as you find you need ' em '' . 
he did n't even ask the cost of this collection . 
after_all , if you were going to set_up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that was that . 
when he return home , the station_wagon loaded with tool , person had go with a friend to some meeting in the village , use the recently purchase second car . 
he be glad . 
it give him a chance to unload the stuff and get_down it down to the cellar without a barrage of acid comment . 
he had make such a fuss about buy that second car that he know he be vulnerable . 
he pile everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turn to stare at the blank stone wall . 
that be where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand_tool . 
in_front of it would be his workbench . 
the old nightmare which had cause him so many wakeful hour come charge in on him once_more , only this time he could n't pacify it with a sleeping_pill and send it away . 
how in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall ? 
how did one attach anything to a stone wall , for_that_matter ? 
after the pegboard there would be the paneling . 
he sit_down on an old box and focus_on the problem . 
perhaps one bore hole in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget . 
but then , when you stick thing into the hole , why did n't they come_out right out again ? 
it all seem rather hopeless . 
he turn his attention to the workbench . 
perhaps that be the first thing to do . 
a workbench have a heavy top and sturdy leg , but how did you attach sturdy leg to a heavy top so that the whole_thing did n't wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you lean_on it ? 
person had do some figure on a scrap of paper and give him the various kind of board and two-by-four which , properly handle , would , he had assure him , turn_into a workbench . 
they lie on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile . 
person poke_at it gingerly with his foot . 
how could anyone know what to do with an assortment like that ? 
perhaps he had_better have someone help him put_up the pegboard and build the workbench - someone who know what he was about . 
then at_least he would have a place to hang his tool and something to work on . 
after that everything should be simple . 
he go upstairs to phone person . 
to his amazement he reach him . 
person be laid_up with a bad cold . 
he did n't seem to think that attach a pegboard to a stone wall be much of a problem and he tossed_off the building of the worktable equally lightly . 
the only trouble be that he himself be tied_up on the school job . 
that be why he had n't be able to finish the porch . 
no , he did n't know of any handyman carpenter . 
there was n't any such thing anymore . 
carpenter all want steady work and at the moment every mother's_son for twenty mile around that could hammer nail for twenty-five dollar a day was work_on the school job . 
there was a fellow named person over location way . 
nobody like to hire him because you never could tell when he was going_to be take drunk . 
person would probably see him at group meeting the next night . 
if he be sober , which be doubtful , he 'd have him get_in_touch with person . 
person had be at_least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turn_out to be the greatest boon that had come into person 's life since he move to location , in_spite_of the fact that he did n't work very fast or very long at_a_time , and he did n't like to work at_all unless person hang_around and talk to him . 
he say he be the lonely type and work in a cellar you see funny thing come out of the crack in the wall if they be n't nobody with you . 
so person sit on a wooden box and talk in_order to keep person 's mind from funny thing . 
at_the_same_time he watch carefully to see how one attach pegboard to stone wall , but person was usually stand in his line_of_vision and it all seem so simple that he did n't like to disclose his ignorance . 
while person was put_up the pegboard and start the workbench , person tell him of this idea about panel the whole end of the cellar . 
person agree that this would be pretty . 
without further discussion he appear the next morning with a pile of board sticking over the end of his light truck and proceed with the paneling , which he then stain and wax according_to his taste . 
`` now '' , he say , `` we got to put_in some outlet for them power_tool ; then a_couple_of fluorescent lamp over the workbench an ' i guess we be about through down here '' . 
it all did look very efficient and shipshape . 
there was no question of_that . 
`` by_the_way '' , say person , pack his tool into a battered carrier , `` them power_tool need extra voltage . 
i guess you know about that . 
before you use ' em the light company 's have_got to run in a heavy line and you 'll need a new fuse box for the extra circuit . 
that be n't too bad ' ceptin ' the light_company 's so busy you can n't ever get ' em to do nothin '' ' . 
instead of being depress by this news , person be actually relieved . 
at_least the moment be postponed when he had_to face the mystery of the power_tool . 
he follow person up the cellar stairs . 
as_usual , person was stand in_the_midst of a confusion of cooking_utensil . 
person sit_down in the only unoccupied kitchen chair . 
`` well '' , he say , `` get your man fix_up nicely down there . 
he oughta be able to build a new house with all them contraption '' . 
person watch his wife with an anxious expression . 
`` i was just say ' to him that i be all ready now for anything else you want do '' . 
person could n't remember his say any such thing . 
`` oh , that be wonderful '' , cry person . 
`` i have a_thousand thing for you to do . 
door that won n't open , and door that won n't close and shelf and broken '' . 
`` but those be the thing i build the workshop for '' , protest person . 
`` those be the thing i can do , now that i be set_up '' . 
`` i 've been wait to get these thing done for month '' , she say . 
`` we won n't live long enough if i wait for you , besides which you do n't need to worry - there 'll be plenty more '' . 
but the discussion be academic . 
person was already take measurement for a shelf above the kitchen_sink .
